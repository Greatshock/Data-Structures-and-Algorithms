     I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed A yellow dressinggownungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air Heheld the bowl aloft and intonedINTROIBO AD ALTARE DEIHalted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarselyCome up Kinch Come up you fearful jesuitSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and theawaking mountains Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat andshaking his head Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hairgrained and hued like pale oakBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartlyBack to barracks he said sternlyHe added in a preachers toneFor this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul andblood and ouns Slow music please Shut your eyes gents One moment Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles Silence allHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call thenpaused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points Chrysostomos Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calmThanks old chap he cried briskly That will do nicely Switch off thecurrent will youHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watchergathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middleages A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lipsThe mockery of it he said gaily Your absurd name an ancient GreekHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapetlaughing to himself Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neckBuck Mulligans gay voice went

going to stay in this towerBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulderGod isnt he dreadful he said frankly A ponderous Saxon He thinksyoure not a gentleman God these bloody English Bursting with moneyand indigestion Because he comes from Oxford You know Dedalus youhave the real Oxford manner He cant make you out O my name for youis the best Kinch the knifebladeHe shaved warily over his chinHe was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said Where ishis guncaseA woful lunatic Mulligan said Were you in a funkI was Stephen said with energy and growing fear Out here in

lather on his razorblade He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastilyScutter he cried thicklyHe came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket saidLend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razorStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatlyThen gazing over the handkerchief he saidThe bards noserag A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreenYou can almost taste it cant youHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay hisfair

Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with youSomeone killed her Stephen said gloomilyYou could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying motherasked you Buck Mulligan said Im hyperborean as much as you But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her And you refused There is something sinister in you He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek A tolerantsmile curled his lipsBut a lovely mummer he murmured to himself Kinch the loveliestmummer of them allHe shaved evenly and with care in silence seriouslyStephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoatsleeve Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heartSilently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faintodour of wetted ashes Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomitingBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorbladeAh poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice I must give you a shirt anda few noserags How are the secondhand breeksThey fit well enough Stephen answeredBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlipThe mockery of it he said

his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skinStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyesThat fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan saysyou have gpi Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman Generalparalysis of the insaneHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunkLook at yourself he said you dreadful bardStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleftby a crooked crack Hair on end As he and others see me Who chose thisface for me This dogsbody to rid of vermin It asks me tooI pinched it out of the skivvys room Buck Mulligan said It does herall right The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi Leadhim not into temptation And her name is UrsulaLaughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyesThe rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said IfWilde were only alive to see youDrawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitternessIt is a symbol of Irish art The cracked lookingglass of a servantBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust themIts not fair to tease you like that Kinch is it he said kindly Godknows you have more spirit than any of themParried again He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his Thecold

the snout of a sleeping whale Stephen freed his armquietlyDo you wish me to tell you he askedYes what is it Buck Mulligan answered I dont remember anythingHe looked in Stephens face as he spoke A light wind passed hisbrow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyesStephen depressed by his own voice saidDo you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeathBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and saidWhat Where I cant remember anything I remember only ideas andsensations Why What happened in the name of GodYou were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to getmore hot water Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom She asked you who was in your roomYes Buck Mulligan said What did I say I forgetYou said

lifting hisbrowsCan you recall brother is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the UpanishadsI doubt it said Stephen gravelyDo you now Buck Mulligan said in the same tone Your reasons prayI fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of MaryAnnBuck Mulligans face smiled with delightCharming he

and asked blandlyIs this the day for your monthly wash KinchThen he said to HainesThe unclean bard makes a point of washing once a monthAll Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let

will let meSpeaking to me They wash and tub and scrub Agenbite of inwitConscience Yet heres a spotThat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced goodBuck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of toneWait till you hear him on Hamlet HainesWell I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came inWould I make any money by it Stephen askedHaines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock saidI dont know Im sureHe strolled out to the doorway Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigourYou put your hoof in it now What did you say that forWell Stephen said The problem is to get money From whom From themilkwoman or from him Its a toss up I thinkI blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibesI see little hope Stephen said from her or from himBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens armFrom me Kinch he saidIn a suddenly changed tone he addedTo tell you the Gods truth I think youre right Damn all else theyare good for Why dont you play them as I do To hell with them all Letus get out of the kipHe stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gownsaying resignedlyMulligan is stripped of his garmentsHe emptied his pockets on to the tableTheres your snotrag he saidAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to themchiding them and to his dangling watchchain His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief God wellsimply have to dress the character I want puce gloves and green bootsContradiction Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradictmyself Mercurial Malachi A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghandsAnd theres your Latin quarter hat he saidStephen picked it up and put it on Haines called to them from thedoorwayAre you coming you fellowsIm ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door Come outKinch You have eaten all we left I suppose Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrowAnd going forth he met ButterlyStephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them outand as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit He put the huge key in his inner pocketAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan askedDid you bring the keyI have it Stephen said preceding themHe walked on Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grassesDown sir How dare you sirHaines askedDo you pay rent for this towerTwelve quid Buck Mulligan saidTo the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulderThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at lastRather bleak in wintertime I should say Martello you call itBilly Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were onthe sea But ours is the omphalosWhat is your idea of Hamlet Haines asked StephenNo no Buck Mulligan shouted in pain Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up Wait tillI have a few pints in me firstHe turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoatYou couldnt manage it under three pints Kinch could youIt has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longerYou pique my curiosity Haines said amiably Is it some paradoxPooh Buck Mulligan said We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxesIts quite simple He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfatherWhat Haines said beginning to point at Stephen He himselfBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bendingin loose laughter said to Stephens earO shade of Kinch the elder Japhet in search of a fatherWere always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines And it israther long to tellBuck Mulligan walking forward again raised his handsThe sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he saidI mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA ISNT ITBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attiresIts a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt againEyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudentThe seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the MuglinsI read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemusedThe Father and the Son idea The Son striving to be atoned with theFatherBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face Helooked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety Hemoved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD    MY MOTHERS A JEW MY FATHERS A BIRD    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARYHe held up a forefinger of warning  IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAINHe tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and runningforward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYEHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole flutteringhis winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet criesHaines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephenand saidWe oughtnt to laugh I suppose Hes rather blasphemous Im not abeliever myself that is to say Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow doesnt it What did he call it Joseph the JoinerThe ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answeredO Haines said you have heard it beforeThree times a day after meals Stephen said drilyYoure not a believer are you Haines asked I mean a believer in thenarrow sense of the word Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal GodTheres only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen saidHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone He sprang it open with his thumb and offered itThank you Stephen said taking a cigaretteHaines helped himself and snapped the case to He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang itopen too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his handsYes of course he said as they went on again Either you believe oryou dont isnt it Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod You dont stand for that I supposeYou behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horribleexample of

wavering line along thepath They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark He wants thatkey It is mine I paid the rent Now I eat his salt bread Give him thekey too All He will ask for it That

seems to meI am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an ItalianItalian Haines saidA crazy queen old and jealous Kneel down before meAnd a third Stephen said there is who wants me for

hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleadingOn his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshapedrecent and damp as a snails

Mychildhood bends beside me Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly Mine is far and his secret as our eyes Secrets silent stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of

cried continually without listeningCochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen saidWill you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restoreorder hereAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternlyWhat is the matter What is it nowTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many formsclosed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the

ignorance They actedaccording to their lightsFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the NorthCircular road It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such animportant thoroughfare

Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of adreadful catastrophe in New York In America those things werecontinually happening Unfortunate people to die like that unpreparedStill an act of perfect contritionFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergins publichouse against thewindow of which two unlabouring men lounged They saluted him andwere salutedFather Conmee passed H J ONeills funeral

bargeman with a hat of dirtystraw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar abovehim It was idyllic and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of theCreator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out andbring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor peopleOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee SJ of saintFrancis Xaviers church upper Gardiner street stepped on to an outwardbound tramOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas DudleyC C of saint Agathas church north William street on to NewcomenbridgeAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward boundtram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud IslandFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tuckedwith care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings asixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into hispurse Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspectorusually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticketThe solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmeeexcessive for a journey so short and cheap Father Conmee liked cheerfuldecorumIt was a peaceful day The gentleman with the glasses opposite FatherConmee had finished explaining and looked down His wife FatherConmee supposed A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentlemanwith the glasses She raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gentlytiptapping  her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinilysweetlyFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car He perceived alsothat the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge ofthe seatFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in themouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky headAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go anold woman rose suddenly from her place to alight The conductor pulledthe bellstrap to stay the car for her She passed out with her basket anda marketnet and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net andbasket down and Father Conmee thought that as she had nearly passedthe end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had alwaysto be told twice BLESS YOU MY CHILD that they have been absolved PRAYFOR ME But they had so many worries in life so many cares poorcreaturesFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips atFather ConmeeFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellowmen and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver SJ and the African missionand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brownand yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their lasthour came like a thief in the night That book by the Belgian jesuit LENOMBRE DES ELUS seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea Those weremillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom thefaith had not DV been brought But they were Gods souls created byGod It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost awaste if one might sayAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted was saluted by theconductor and

the seas adjoiningThen came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one dayThose were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old timesin the baronyFather Conmee walking thought

ample underleaves The sky showed him a flock ofsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind MOUTONNER the Frenchsaid A just and homely wordFather Conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoningclouds over Rathcoffey His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubbleof Clongowes field He walked there reading in the evening and heard thecries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet eveningHe was their rector his reign was mildFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary outAn ivory bookmark told him the pageNones He should have read that

to murmur to himself in a faltering undertoneGod blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart Blimey itmakes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when I sees her cause Ithinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down Limehouse waySo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and thecorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speaktheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone fora quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump thathe cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and theantitreating league and drink the curse of Ireland Antitreatingis about the size of it Gob hed let you pour all manner of drinkdown his throat till the Lord would call him before youd eversee the froth of his pint And

badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lotof colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medalsand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolaghentertainment dont be talking Ireland sober is Ireland free And thenan old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougersshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of And one or two skypilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the femaleshitting below the beltSo howandever as I was saying the old dog seeing the tin was emptystarts mousing around by Joe and me Id train him by

andgrousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and thehydrophobia dropping out of his jawsAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture amongthe lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of notmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by thefamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the SOBRIQUET ofGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends andacquaintances Owen Garry The exhibition which is the result of years oftraining by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprisesamong other achievements the recitation of verse Our greatest livingphonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stoneunturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and hasfound it bears a STRIKING resemblance the italics are ours to the rannsof ancient Celtic bards We are not speaking so much of those delightfullovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under thegraceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised thebookloving world but rather as a contributor D O C points out in aninteresting communication published by an evening contemporary of theharsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusionsof the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a moremodern lyrist at present very much in the public eye We subjoin aspecimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholarwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose thoughwe believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rathermore than an indication The metrical system of the canine originalwhich recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules ofthe Welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe ourreaders will agree that the spirit has been well caught Perhapsit should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owensverse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestiveof suppressed rancour    THE CURSE OF MY CURSES    SEVEN DAYS EVERY DAY    AND SEVEN DRY THURSDAYS    ON YOU BARNEY KIERNAN    HAS NO SUP OF WATER    TO

like a shot off a shovel          The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysteriousembrace Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of alltoo fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proudpromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay onthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and last but not least on thequiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness thevoice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to thestormtossed heart of man Mary star of the seaThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the eveningscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly Many a time and oftwere they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chatbeside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine Cissy Caffrey andEdy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and JackyCaffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps tomatch and the name HMS Belleisle printed on both For Tommy andJacky Caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiledtwins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merryfaces and endearing ways about them They were dabbling in the sand withtheir spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing withtheir big coloured ball happy as the day was long And Edy Boardman wasrocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that younggentleman fairly chuckled with delight He was but eleven months and ninedays old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp hisfirst babyish words Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fatlittle plucks and the dainty dimple in his chinNow baby Cissy Caffrey said Say out big big I want a drink ofwaterAnd baby prattled after herA jink a jink a jawboCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of childrenso patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got totake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose andpromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrupon What a persuasive power that girl had But to be sure baby Boardmanwas as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib None ofyour spoilt beauties Flora MacFlimsy sort was Cissy CaffreyA truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh inher gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips agirl lovable in the extreme And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaintlanguage of little brotherBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommyand Master Jacky Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exceptionto this golden rule The apple of discord was a certain castle of sandwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrongthat it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like theMartello tower had But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky wasselfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little Irishmans houseis his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that thewouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castletoo Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew theattention of the girl friendsCome here Tommy his sister called imperatively At once And youJacky for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand Wait till I catchyou for thatHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call fortheir big sisters word was law with the twins And in a sad plight he wastoo after his misadventure His little manowar top and unmentionableswere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothingover lifes tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand wasto be seen on his smart little suit Still the blue eyes were glisteningwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness andshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was nearhim she wouldnt be far from him her eyes dancing in admonitionNasty bold Jacky she criedShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winninglyWhats your name Butter and creamTell us who is your sweetheart spoke Edy Boardman Is Cissy yoursweetheartNao tearful Tommy saidIs Edy Boardman your sweetheart Cissy queriedNao Tommy saidI know Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance fromher shortsighted eyes I know who is Tommys sweetheart Gerty isTommys sweetheartNao Tommy said on the verge of tearsCissys quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whisperedto Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where thegentleman couldnt see and to mind he didnt wet his new tan shoesBut who was GertyGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions lost inthought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair aspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see She waspronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said shewas more a Giltrap than a MacDowell Her figure was slight and gracefulinclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking oflate had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welchsfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to getand that tired feeling The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritualin its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupidsbow Greekly perfect Her hands were of finely veined alabasterwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointmentscould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid glovesin bed or take a milk footbath either Bertha Supple told that onceto Edy Boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggersdrawn with Gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffsfrom time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not tolet on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed neverspeak to her again No Honour where honour is due There was aninnate refinement a languid queenly HAUTEUR about Gerty whichwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instepHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree inher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good educationGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in theland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow andpatrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirsto her Mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent toher softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaningthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charmfew could resist Why have women such eyes of witchery Gertys were ofthe bluest Irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressivebrows Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive It wasMadame Vera Verity directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the PrincessNovelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave thathaunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion andshe had never regretted it Then there was blushing scientifically curedand how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face butyour nose That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one ButGertys crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair It was dark brownwith a natural wave in it She had cut it that very morning on accountof the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion ofluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too Thursday for wealth And justnow at Edys words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintestrosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlishshyness that of a surety Gods fair land of Ireland did not holdher equalFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes She wasabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue Inclinationprompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent The pretty lipspouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous littlelaugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning She knewright well noone better what made squinty Edy say that because of himcooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel As perusual somebodys nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycleoff the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of herwindow Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studyinghard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he wasgoing to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he leftthe high school like his brother W E Wylie who was racing in thebicycle races in Trinity college university Little recked he perhapsfor what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimespiercing to the core Yet he was young and perchance he mightlearn to love her in time They were protestants in his familyand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the BlessedVirgin and then Saint Joseph But he was undeniably handsome with anexquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman theshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would knowanywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle atthe lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of thosegood cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she andthat was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever becausehe didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a gardenGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary ofDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might beout A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because itwas expected in the LADYS PICTORIAL that electric blue would be wornwith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocketin which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with herfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and anavy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim gracefulfigure to perfection She wore a coquettish little love of a hat ofwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggbluechenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone All Tuesdayweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at lastshe found what she wanted at Clerys summer sales the very it slightlyshopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny Shedid it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on thensmiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to herAnd when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that thatwould take the shine out of some people she knew Her shoes were thenewest thing in footwear Edy Boardman prided herself that she was veryPETITE but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell a five and neverwould ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle overher higharched instep Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfectproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more ofher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and widegarter tops As for undies they were Gertys chief care and who that knowsthe fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though Gerty wouldnever see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her She hadfour dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments andnighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbonsrosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herselfand blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed themand she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trustthose washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the thingsShe was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her owncolour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhereon her because the green she wore that day week brought grief becausehis father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibitionand because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she wasdressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside outand that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things oninside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so longas it wasnt of a FridayAnd yet and yet That strained look on her face A gnawing sorrow isthere all the time Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worldsto be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way totears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough nottoo much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror You arelovely Gerty it said The paly light of evening falls upon a faceinfinitely sad and wistful Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain Yes she hadknown from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has beenarranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T C Dbecause the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie and inthe fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuousconfection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be He wastoo young to understand He would not believe in love a womansbirthright The night of the party long ago in Stoers he was still inshort trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waistshe went white to the very lips He called her little one in a strangelyhusky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the endof her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark aboutrefreshments Impetuous fellow Strength of character had never been ReggyWylies strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must bea man among men But waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leapyear too and would soon be over No prince charming is her beau ideal tolay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with astrong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightlyflecked with grey and who would understand take her in his shelteringarms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate natureand comfort her with a long long kiss It would be like heaven For sucha one she yearns this balmy summer eve With all the heart of her shelongs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sicknessin health till death us two part from this to this day forwardAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she wasjust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself hislittle wife to be Then they could talk about her till they went blue inthe face Bertha Supple too and Edy little spitfire because she wouldbe twentytwo in November She would care for him with creature comfortstoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked thatfeeling of hominess Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue andqueen Anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions fromall because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in thefine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then creamthe milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt likethe eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often shewondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses andthey would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures andengravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltraps lovely dogGarryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for thechairs and that silver toastrack in Clerys summer jumble sales like theyhave in rich houses He would be tall with broad shoulders she had alwaysadmired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under hiscarefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continentfor their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settleddown in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning theywould both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own twoselves and before he went out to business he would give his dear littlewifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyesEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes sothen she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to runoff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight But Tommysaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with theball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but Tommy said it washis ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if youplease The temper of him O he was a man already was little TommyCaffrey since he was out of pinnies Edy told him no no and to be off nowwith him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to himYoure not my sister naughty Tommy said Its my ballBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up look up high at herfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand andTommy after it in full career having won the dayAnything for a quiet life laughed CissAnd she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heresthe lord mayor heres his two horses heres his gingerbread carriageand here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin But Edygot as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that fromeveryone always petting himId like to give him something she said so I would where I wont sayOn the beeoteetom laughed Cissy merrilyGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissysaying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of herlife to say flushing a deep rosy red and Edy Boardman said she was surethe gentleman opposite heard what she said But not a pin cared CissLet him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of hernose Give it to him too on the same place as quick as Id look at himMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls You had to laugh at hersometimes For instance when she asked you would you have some moreChinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mensfaces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when shewanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit tothe Miss White That was just like Cissycums O and will you ever forgether the evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the burnedcork moustache and walked down Tritonville road smoking a cigaretteThere was none to come up to her for fun But she was sincerity itselfone of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of yourtwofaced things too sweet to be wholesomeAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and thepealing anthem of the organ It was the mens temperance retreat conductedby the missioner the reverend John Hughes S J rosary sermon andbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament They were there gatheredtogether without distinction of social class and a most edifyingspectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the wavesafter the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet ofthe immaculate reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loretobeseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar wordsholy Mary holy virgin of virgins How sad to poor Gertys earsHad her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink bytaking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in PearsonsWeekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none Over andover had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brownstudy without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazingout of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rustybucket thinking But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearthsand homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days Nay she had evenwitnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance andhad seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forgethimself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gertyknew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way ofkindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the lowAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerfulVirgin most merciful And Gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard hercompanions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman offSandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so likehimself passing along the strand taking a short walk You never saw himany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for afather because he was too old or something or on account of his face itwas a palpable case of Doctor Fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimpleson it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose Poor fatherWith all his faults she loved him still when he sang TELL ME MARY HOW TOWOO THEE or MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE and they had stewed cocklesand lettuce with Lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang THEMOON HATH RAISED with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried Godhave mercy on him from a stroke Her mothers birthday that was andCharley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs andPatsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group takenNoone would have thought the end was so near Now he was laid to restAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest ofhis days and he couldnt even go to the funeral on account of the gout andshe had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from hisoffice about Catesbys cork lino artistic standard designs fit for apalace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the homeA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the housea ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in goldAnd when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was itrubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didnt likeher mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thingthey ever had words about taking snuff Everyone thought the world of herfor her gentle ways It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main everynight and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where shenever forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocerschristmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman inthe costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering abunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her latticewindow You could see there was a story behind it The colours were donesomething lovely She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitudeand the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocratShe often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certainpurpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers withthe sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found outin Walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrapabout the halcyon days what they meantThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till atlast Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no gettingbehind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could downtowards the seaweedy rocks Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow tovoice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting thereby himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball Our twochampions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid troubleCissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please Thegentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strandtowards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right underGertys skirt near the little pool by the rock The twins clamoured againfor it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it soGerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt comerolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and CissylaughedIf you fail try again Edy Boardman saidGerty smiled assent and bit her lip A delicate pink crept into herpretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted herskirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jollygood kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towardsthe shingle Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attentionon account of the gentleman opposite looking She felt the warm flush adanger signal always with Gerty MacDowell surging and flaming into hercheeks Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual butnow under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the facethat met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemedto her the saddest she had ever seenThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted andwith it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain oforiginal sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray forus vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose And carewornhearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erredand wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright withhope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the greatsaint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary the most pious Virginsintercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those whoimplored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by herThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles ofchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers Cissy Caffrey played withbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air Peepshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissygone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my worddidnt the little chap enjoy that And then she told him to say papaSay papa baby Say pa pa pa pa pa pa paAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent foreleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of healtha perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to besomething great they saidHaja ja ja hajaCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to situp properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried outholy saint Denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanketthe other way under him Of course his infant majesty was mostobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know itHabaa baaaahabaaa baaaaAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks It was all nouse soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about thegeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss always readywitted gave himin his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen wasquickly appeasedGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out ofthat and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little bratsof twins She gazed out towards the distant sea It was like the paintingsthat man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and sucha pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and theclouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music likethat and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like akind of waft And while she gazed her heart went pitapat Yes it was herhe was looking at and there was meaning in his look His eyes burned intoher as though they would search her through and through read her verysoul Wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trustthem People were so queer She could see at once by his dark eyes and hispale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo shehad of Martin Harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which shepreferred because she wasnt stagestruck like Winny Rippingham thatwanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but shecould not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly RETROUSSE fromwhere he was sitting He was in deep mourning she could see that and thestory of a haunting sorrow was written on his face She would have givenworlds to know what it was He was looking up so intently so still andhe saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel bucklesof her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes downShe was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockingsthinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away Here was that ofwhich she had so often dreamed It was he who mattered and there was joyon her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that hewas like noone else The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him herdreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him If he hadsuffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had beenhimself a sinner a wicked man she cared not Even if he was a protestantor methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her Therewere wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm She was a womanly womannot like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclistsshowing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all toforgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forgetthe memory of the past Then mayhap he would embrace her gently like areal man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girliefor herself aloneRefuge of sinners Comfortress of the afflicted ORA PRO NOBIS Wellhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy cannever be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for theafflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heartGerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glasswindows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of theblessed Virgins sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon OHanlon atthe altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down He lookedalmost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark andhis hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nunin their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novenaof Saint Dominic He told her that time when she told him about that inconfession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could seenot to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we wereall subject to natures laws he said in this life and that that was nosin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God he saidand that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it doneunto me according to Thy Word He was so kind and holy and often and oftenshe thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroideredfloral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock shenoticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came outof a little house to tell the time the day she went there about theflowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know whatsort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views ofDublin or some placeThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jackythrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it Littlemonkeys common as ditchwater Someone ought to take them and give thema good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both ofthem And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because theywere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drownedJacky TommyNot they What a great notion they had So Cissy said it was the verylast time shed ever bring them out She jumped up and called them and sheran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a goodenough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerryshe was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because itwasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it She ranwith long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt atthe side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboyabout Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thoughtshe had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runnershe ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoatrunning and her skinny shanks up as far as possible It would haveserved her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentallyon purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her looktall and got a fine tumble TABLEAU That would have been a very charmingexpose for a gentleman like that to witnessQueen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saintsthey prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handedthe thurible to Canon OHanlon and he put in the incense and censed theBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she wasitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnt becauseshe thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake inall her life because Gerty could see without looking that he nevertook his eyes off of her and then Canon OHanlon handed the thuribleback to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacramentand the choir began to sing the TANTUM ERGO and she just swung her footin and out in time as the music rose and fell to the TANTUMER GOSACRAMEN TUM Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrowsof Georges street on the Tuesday no the Monday before Easter and therewasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparentand not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor formthe cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the differencefor himselfCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball withher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streeltugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only afortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanginglike a caricature Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle herhair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen ona girls shouldersa radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening inits sweetness You would have to travel many a long mile before you founda head of hair the like of that She could almost see the swift answeringflash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerveShe put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim andswung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught theexpression in his eyes He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey Herwomans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at thethought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colourof her face became a glorious roseEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gertyhalf smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse thebaby Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was whynoone could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern ofhers And she said to GertyA penny for your thoughtsWhat replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teethI was only wondering was it lateBecause she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and theirbabby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave agentle hint about its being late And when Cissy came up Edy asked her thetime and Miss Cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissingtime time to kiss again But Edy wanted to know because they were told tobe in earlyWait said Cissy Ill run ask my uncle Peter over there whats the timeby his conundrumSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take hishand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with hiswatchchain looking up at the church Passionate nature though he wasGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself One moment hehad been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and thenext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressedin every line of his distinguishedlooking figureCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was theright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to itand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry hiswatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sunwas set His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke inmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tonesCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle saidhis waterworks were out of orderThen they sang the second verse of the TANTUM ERGO and CanonOHanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down andhe told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fireto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and shecould see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works andshe swung her leg more in and out in time It was getting darker but hecould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch orwhatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands backinto his pockets She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her andshe knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her staysthat that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when sheclipped her hair on account of the moon His dark eyes fixed themselveson her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at hershrine If ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionategaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face It is for youGertrude MacDowell and you know itEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gertynoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect becauseit was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push upthe pushcar and Cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair tomake herself attractive of course and Canon OHanlon stood up with hiscope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to readoff and he read out PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS and Edy and Cissy weretalking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could paythem back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politenesswhen Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing herover Gerty winced sharply A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes thatspoke volumes of scorn immeasurable It hurtO yes it cut deep becauseEdy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would woundlike the confounded little cat she was Gertys lips parted swiftly toframe the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throatso slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artistmight have dreamed of She had loved him better than he knewLighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would neverunderstand what he had meant to her and for an instant there wasin the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears Their eyes wereprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back insympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to seeO responded Gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud headflashed up I can throw my cap at who I like because its leap yearHer words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of theringdove but they cut the silence icily There was that in her youngvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled withAs for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could justchuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would shecast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcardinto a dozen pieces And if ever after he dared to presume shecould give him one look of measured scorn that would make himshrivel up on the spot Miss puny little Edys countenance fell tono slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black asthunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it thelittle kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousyand they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another spherethat she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody elsetoo that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipeand smoke itEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissytucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time toobecause the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior AndCissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to godeedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleefuleyes and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy andbaby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to alland sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bibO my Puddeny pie protested Ciss He has his bib destroyedThe slight CONTRETEMPS claimed her attention but in two twos she setthat little matter to rightsGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough andEdy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it wasflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed itoff with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction becausejust then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashorebecause Canon OHanlon was up on the altar with the veil that FatherConroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the BlessedSacrament in his handsHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse ofErin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a batflew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with atiny lost cry And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses sopicturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it waseasier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going hisrounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shadyTritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near herwindow where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in thatbook THE LAMPLIGHTER by Miss Cummins author of MABEL VAUGHAN andother tales For Gerty had her dreams that noone knew of She loved toread poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovelyconfession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in shelaid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not erron the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean It was thereshe kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs herchild of Mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine heralabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things camehome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts writtenin it in violet ink that she bought in Helys of Dame Street forshe felt that she too could write poetry if she could only expressherself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she hadcopied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs ARTTHOU REAL MY IDEAL it was called by Louis J Walsh Magherafelt andafter there was something about TWILIGHT WILT THOU EVER and ofttimesthe beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had mistedher eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slippingby for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew sheneed fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkeyhill and she always tried to conceal it But it must end she feltIf she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holdingback for her Love laughs at locksmiths She would make the greatsacrifice Her every effort would be to share his thoughts Dearer thanthe whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happinessThere was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he amarried man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like thenobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her putinto a madhouse cruel only to be kind But even ifwhat then Would itmake a very great difference From everything in the least indelicate herfinebred nature instinctively recoiled She loathed that sort of personthe fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that wentwith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girls honourdegrading the sex and being taken up to the police station No no notthat They would be just good friends like a big brother and sisterwithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a bigess Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the daysbeyond recall She thought she understood She would try to understandhim because men were so different The old love was waiting waitingwith little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes Heartof mine She would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heartthat told her he was her all in all the only man in all the worldfor her for love was the master guide Nothing else mattered Come whatmight she would be wild untrammelled freeCanon OHanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacleand genuflected and the choir sang LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES andthen he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over andFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasntshe coming but Jacky Caffrey called outO look CissyAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too overthe trees beside the church blue and then green and purpleIts fireworks Cissy Caffrey saidAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and thechurch helterskelter Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it andCissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldnt fall runningCome on Gerty Cissy called Its the bazaar fireworksBut Gerty was adamant She had no intention of being at their beck andcall If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she couldsee from where she was The eyes that were fastened upon her sether pulses tingling She looked at him a moment meeting his glanceand a light broke in upon her Whitehot passion was in that face passionsilent as the grave and it had made her his At last they were leftalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew hecould be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man ofinflexible honour to his fingertips His hands and face were workingand a tremour went over her She leaned back far to look up wherethe fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as notto fall back looking up and there was noone to see only him andher when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like thatsupply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the pantingof his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passionof men like that hotblooded because Bertha Supple told her once in deadsecret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that wasstaying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had picturescut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said heused to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes inthe bed But this was altogether different from a thing like thatbecause there was all the difference because she could almost feelhim draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of hishandsome lips Besides there was absolution so long as you didntdo the other thing before being married and there ought to bewomen priests that would understand without your telling out andCissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy lookin her eyes so that she too my dear and Winny Rippingham so madabout actors photographs and besides it was on account of that otherthing coming on the way it didAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned backand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and theyall saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leanedback ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flyingthrough the air a soft thing to and fro dark And she saw a long Romancandle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hushthey were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higherand she had to lean back more and more to look up after it highhigh almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divinean entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her otherthings too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skinbetter than those other pettiwidth the green four and elevenon account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and thenit went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling inevery limb from being bent so far back that he had a full viewhigh up above her knee where noone ever not even on the swing or wadingand she wasnt ashamed and he wasnt either to look in that immodest waylike that because he couldnt resist the sight of the wondrous revealmenthalf offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemenlooking and he kept on looking looking She would fain have cried to himchokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel hislips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girls love a littlestrangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the agesAnd then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O then the Romancandle burst and it was like a sigh of O and everyone cried O O inraptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads andthey shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with goldenO so lovely O soft sweet softThen all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent Ah Sheglanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance ofpiteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girlHe was leaning back against the rock behind Leopold Bloom for it is hestands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes What abrute he had been At it again A fair unsullied soul had called to himand wretch that he was how had he answered An utter cad he had beenHe of all men But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyesfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned andwandered Should a girl tell No a thousand times no That was theirsecret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none toknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the eveningto and fro and little bats dont tellCissy Caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to showwhat a great person she was and then she criedGerty Gerty Were going Come on We can see from farther upGerty had an idea one of loves little ruses She slipped a hand intoher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of coursewithout letting him and then slipped it back Wonder if hes too far toShe rose Was it goodbye No She had to go but they would meet againthere and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream ofyester eve She drew herself up to her full height Their souls met in alast lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of astrange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face She halfsmiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged ontears and then they partedSlowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand toCissy to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey to little baby Boardman It wasdarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippyseaweed She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her butwith care and very slowly becausebecause Gerty MacDowell was Tight boots No Shes lame OMr

woman that lay therein childbed The nursingwoman answered him and said that that womanwas in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unnethto bear but that now in a little it would be She said thereto that shehad seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was thatwomans birth Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew theman that time was had lived nigh that house The man hearkened to herwords for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have ofmotherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face forany man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid Ninetwelve bloodflows chiding her childlessAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and therenighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat And therecame against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept DixonAnd the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that theyhad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where thislearningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healedfor he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible anddreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve ofvolatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice And he said now thathe should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that werethere And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither forhe was a man of cautels and a subtile Also the lady was of his avis andrepreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller hadsaid thing that was false for his subtility But the learningknight wouldnot hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious tohis list and he said how it was a marvellous castle And the travellerLeopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore oflimb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime veneryAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood ofFinlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but theydurst not move more for enchantment And on this board were frightfulswords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons outof white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags thatthere abound marvellously And there were vessels that are wrought bymagic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breaththat he blases in to them like to bubbles And full fair cheer and richwas on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer And therewas a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which laystrange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that thisbe possible thing without they see it natheless they are so And thesefishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land becauseof the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepressAnd also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they makea compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid ofcertain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously liketo a vast mountain And they teach the serpents there to entwinethemselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales ofthese serpents they brew out a brewage like to meadAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halpthereto the while all they that were there drank every each And childeLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat inamity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by andanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and hisneighbour nist not of this wile And he sat down in that castle with themfor to rest him there awhile Thanked be Almighty GodThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them atthe reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing forthere was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fastSir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry thatit was whether of child or woman and I marvel said he that it be notcome or now Meseems it dureth overlong And he was ware and saw afranklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than anyof the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the oneemprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gentlyBut said he or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty andhave joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long And thefranklin that had drunken said Expecting each moment to be her nextAlso he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never noneasking nor desiring of him to drink and Now drink said he fullydelectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths healthfor he was a passing good man of his lustiness And sir Leopoldthat was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall andthat was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandlyhand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the worldone that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly inthe cup Womans woe with wonder ponderingNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to bedrunken an they might There was a sort of scholars along either side theboard that is to wit Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciables withother his fellows Lynch and Madden scholars of medicine and the franklinthat hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa one Crotthers and youngStephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board andCostello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of himerewhile gested and of all them reserved young Stephen he was the mostdrunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sirLeopold But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised tohave come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had brokehis avow And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendshipto sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languorbecalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feastedhim for that time in the honourablest manner Ruth red him love ledon with will to wander loth to leaveFor they were right witty scholars And he heard their aresouns eachgen other as touching birth and righteousness young Madden maintainingthat put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen outa matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Hornes house thatnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before herdeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case And theysaid farther she should live because in the beginning they said thewoman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of thisimagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscienceto let her die And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubtthat the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeitthe mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges didprovide no remedy A redress God grant This was scant said but all criedwith one acclaim nay by our Virgin Mother the wife should live and thebabe to die In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what withargument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompteach when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lackThen young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she wasdead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and fora vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband wouldnot let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved To whom youngStephen had these words following Murmur sirs is eke oft among layfolk Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker the one in limbogloom the other in purgefire But gramercy what of those Godpossibledsouls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the HolyGhost Very God Lord and Giver of Life For sirs he said our lustis brief We are means to those small creatures within us and naturehas other ends than we Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wisthe what ends But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he couldhave of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she wereor wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of hisspleen of lustihead Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang youngMalachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millenniumhe cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward withtheir jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and severalby saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any mannerof thing that lay in man to do Thereat laughed they all rightjocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laughtoo open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray andalso for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoeverThen spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast himout of her bosom of law of canons of Lilith patron of abortions of bignesswrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth tomouth or as Virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reekof moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain withEFFECTU SECUTO or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions ofAverroes and Moses Maimonides He said also how at the end of the secondmonth a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldethever souls for Gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which wasbut a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeththe fishermans seal even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy churchfor all ages founded All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would hein like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life A wariness ofmind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he saiddissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had everloved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with hisexperience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Churchbelike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly hescaped their questions That is truth pardy said Dixon and or I erra pregnant word Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man andhe averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for hewas of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in thattaking it appeared eftsoonsBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he stillhad pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labourand as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an onlymanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of artcould save so dark is destiny And she was wondrous stricken of heart forthat evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambswool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lieakeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now SirLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him hisfriends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness andas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for allaccounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure foryoung Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels andmurdered his goods with whoresAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood emptyso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed theirapproach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for theintentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicarof Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray Now drink we quod heof this mazer and quaff ye this mead

hospitality that wassending over Doctor Rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in allMuscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull bythe horns Come come says Mr Vincent plain dealing Hell find himselfon the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats Irish says heIrish by name and irish by nature says Mr Stephen and he sent the alepurling about an Irish bull in an English chinashop I conceive you saysMr Dixon It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmerNicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emeraldring in his nose True for you says Mr Vincent cross the tableand a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlierbull says he never shit on shamrock He had horns galore a coat ofcloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils sothat the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpinsfollowed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychainsWhat for that says Mr Dixon but before he came over farmerNicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctorswho were no better off than himself So be off now says he and do all mycousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmers blessing andwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly But the slap and theblessing stood him friend says Mr Vincent for to make up he taught him atrick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to thisday affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his earin the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holytongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the fourfields of all Ireland Another then put in his word And they dressed himsays he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle andruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all overwith spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of theroad with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the marketso that he could doss and dung to his hearts content By this timethe father of the faithful for so they called him was grown soheavy that he could scarce walk to pasture To remedy which ourcozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlapsand as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uartersto show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bullslanguage and they all after him Ay says another and so pampered was hethat he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass forhimself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a boardput up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed noticesaying By the Lord Harry Green is the grass that grows on the groundAnd says Mr Dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommonor the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowingas much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed runamok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whateverwas planted and all by lord Harrys orders There was bad blood betweenthem at first says Mr Vincent and the lord Harry called farmerNicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster thatkept seven trulls in his house and Ill meddle in his matterssays he Ill make that animal smell hell says he with the helpof that good pizzle my father left me But one evening says MrDixon when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinnerafter winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first ruleof the course was that the others were to row with pitchforkshe discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on pickingup a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sureenough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bullof the Romans BOS BOVUM which is good bog Latin for boss of theshow After that says Mr Vincent the lord Harry put his head intoa cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers andpulling it out again told them all his new name Then with the waterrunning off him he got into an old smock and skirt that hadbelonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bullslanguage to study but he could never learn a word of it except the firstpersonal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if everhe went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it uponwhat took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale ofcotton or a corkfloat In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon asfast friends as an arse and a shirt They were says Mr Stephen and theend was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as theungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselvesand their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect mannedthe yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the windput her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ranup the jolly Roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushedoff in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of AmericaWhich was the occasion says Mr Vincent of the composing by a boatswainof that

with a friendwhom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name Alec Bannonwho had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or acornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars Mr Mulligan was civilenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with aproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched onWhereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which hehad had printed that day at Mr Quinnells bearing a legend printed in fairitalics MR MALACHI MULLIGAN FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR LAMBAY ISLAND Hisproject as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idlepleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sirMilksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task forwhich our bodily organism has been framed Well let us hear of it goodmy friend said Mr Dixon I make no doubt it smacks of wenching Come beseated both Tis as cheap sitting as standing Mr Mulligan accepted ofthe invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that hehad been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes ofsterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibitionin its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of thebalance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defectscongenital or from proclivities acquired It grieved him plaguily hesaid to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and toreflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to thevilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenialcloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountablemuskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing theinestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows wereat hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weepTo curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppressionof latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worthand inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in feesimple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holderlord Talbot de Malahide a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with ourascendancy party He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farmto be named OMPHALOS with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion ofEgypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of anyfemale of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him withthe desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural Money was noobject he said nor would he take a penny for his pains The poorestkitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be theirconstructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitionswould find in him their man For his nutriment he shewed how he wouldfeed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish andconeys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highlyrecommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade ofmace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies After this homily which hedelivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put offfrom his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it They both itseems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pacehad taken water as might be observed by Mr Mulligans smallclothes of ahodden grey which was now somewhat piebald His project meanwhile wasvery favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies fromall though Mr Dixon of Marys excepted to it asking with a finicking airdid he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle Mr Mulligan however madecourt to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which asit dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support ofhis contention TALIS AC TANTA DEPRAVATIO HUJUS SECULI O QUIRITES UTMATRESFAMILIARUM NOSTRAE LASCIVAS CUJUSLIBET SEMIVIRI LIBICI

overjoyed as he was at apassage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell ithis nearest neighbour Mr Mulligan now perceiving the table asked forwhom were those loaves and fishes and seeing

replied that he was comethere about a lady now an inmate of Hornes house that was in aninteresting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetcheda deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet

create themselves wits at the cost of femininedelicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he wouldconcede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a properbreeding

while the above was goingon were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation wasas astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjecturedthe contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrongshop During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hardat a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co atBurtononTrent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of othersright opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated toattract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance He wassimply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best knownto himself which put quite an altogether different complexion onthe proceedings after the moment befores observations about boyhooddays and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions ofhis own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babeunborn Eventually however both their eyes met and as soon asit began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to helphimself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himselfand so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glassrecipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacioushole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same timehowever a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upsetany of the beer that was in it about the placeThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome ofthe course of life Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity Thedebaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on theloftiest and most vital The high hall of Hornes house had never beheld anassembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of

young poet who found a refuge from his labours ofpedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere ofSocratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated theflippant

no lureor peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of thatvoluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned forages yet to comeIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the pervertedtranscendentalism to which Mr S Dedalus Div Scep contentions wouldappear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to acceptedscientific methods Science it cannot be too often repeated deals withtangible phenomena The man of science like the man in the street has toface hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best hecan There may be it is true some questions which science cannotanswerat presentsuch as the first problem submitted by Mr L Bloom PubbCanv regarding the future determination of sex Must we accept the viewof Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual periodassert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too longneglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it asmost embryologists incline to opine such as Culpepper SpallanzaniBlumenbach Lusk Hertwig Leopold and Valenti a mixture of both Thiswould be tantamount to a cooperation one of natures favourite devicesbetween the NISUS FORMATIVUS of the nemasperm on the one hand and on theother a happily chosen position SUCCUBITUS FELIX of the passive element Theother

isundoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting tocount the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to benormative In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder isthat so
