     I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed A yellow dressinggownungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air Heheld the bowl aloft and intonedINTROIBO AD ALTARE DEIHalted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarselyCome up Kinch Come up you fearful jesuitSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and theawaking mountains Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat andshaking his head Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hairgrained and hued like pale oakBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartlyBack to barracks he said sternlyHe added in a preachers toneFor this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul andblood and ouns Slow music please Shut your eyes gents One moment Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles Silence allHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call thenpaused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points Chrysostomos Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calmThanks old chap he cried briskly That will do nicely Switch off thecurrent will youHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watchergathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middleages A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lipsThe mockery of it he said gaily Your absurd name an ancient GreekHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapetlaughing to himself Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neckBuck Mulligans gay voice went

going to stay in this towerBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulderGod isnt he dreadful he said frankly A ponderous Saxon He thinksyoure not a gentleman God these bloody English Bursting with moneyand indigestion Because he comes from Oxford You know Dedalus youhave the real Oxford manner He cant make you out O my name for youis the best Kinch the knifebladeHe shaved warily over his chinHe was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said Where ishis guncaseA woful lunatic Mulligan said Were you in a funkI was Stephen said with energy and growing fear Out here in

lather on his razorblade He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastilyScutter he cried thicklyHe came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket saidLend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razorStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatlyThen gazing over the handkerchief he saidThe bards noserag A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreenYou can almost taste it cant youHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay hisfair

Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with youSomeone killed her Stephen said gloomilyYou could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying motherasked you Buck Mulligan said Im hyperborean as much as you But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her And you refused There is something sinister in you He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek A tolerantsmile curled his lipsBut a lovely mummer he murmured to himself Kinch the loveliestmummer of them allHe shaved evenly and with care in silence seriouslyStephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoatsleeve Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heartSilently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faintodour of wetted ashes Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomitingBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorbladeAh poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice I must give you a shirt anda few noserags How are the secondhand breeksThey fit well enough Stephen answeredBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlipThe mockery of it he said

his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skinStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyesThat fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan saysyou have gpi Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman Generalparalysis of the insaneHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunkLook at yourself he said you dreadful bardStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleftby a crooked crack Hair on end As he and others see me Who chose thisface for me This dogsbody to rid of vermin It asks me tooI pinched it out of the skivvys room Buck Mulligan said It does herall right The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi Leadhim not into temptation And her name is UrsulaLaughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyesThe rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said IfWilde were only alive to see youDrawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitternessIt is a symbol of Irish art The cracked lookingglass of a servantBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust themIts not fair to tease you like that Kinch is it he said kindly Godknows you have more spirit than any of themParried again He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his Thecold

the snout of a sleeping whale Stephen freed his armquietlyDo you wish me to tell you he askedYes what is it Buck Mulligan answered I dont remember anythingHe looked in Stephens face as he spoke A light wind passed hisbrow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyesStephen depressed by his own voice saidDo you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeathBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and saidWhat Where I cant remember anything I remember only ideas andsensations Why What happened in the name of GodYou were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to getmore hot water Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom She asked you who was in your roomYes Buck Mulligan said What did I say I forgetYou said

lifting hisbrowsCan you recall brother is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the UpanishadsI doubt it said Stephen gravelyDo you now Buck Mulligan said in the same tone Your reasons prayI fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of MaryAnnBuck Mulligans face smiled with delightCharming he

and asked blandlyIs this the day for your monthly wash KinchThen he said to HainesThe unclean bard makes a point of washing once a monthAll Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let

will let meSpeaking to me They wash and tub and scrub Agenbite of inwitConscience Yet heres a spotThat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced goodBuck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of toneWait till you hear him on Hamlet HainesWell I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came inWould I make any money by it Stephen askedHaines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock saidI dont know Im sureHe strolled out to the doorway Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigourYou put your hoof in it now What did you say that forWell Stephen said The problem is to get money From whom From themilkwoman or from him Its a toss up I thinkI blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibesI see little hope Stephen said from her or from himBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens armFrom me Kinch he saidIn a suddenly changed tone he addedTo tell you the Gods truth I think youre right Damn all else theyare good for Why dont you play them as I do To hell with them all Letus get out of the kipHe stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gownsaying resignedlyMulligan is stripped of his garmentsHe emptied his pockets on to the tableTheres your snotrag he saidAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to themchiding them and to his dangling watchchain His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief God wellsimply have to dress the character I want puce gloves and green bootsContradiction Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradictmyself Mercurial Malachi A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghandsAnd theres your Latin quarter hat he saidStephen picked it up and put it on Haines called to them from thedoorwayAre you coming you fellowsIm ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door Come outKinch You have eaten all we left I suppose Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrowAnd going forth he met ButterlyStephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them outand as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit He put the huge key in his inner pocketAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan askedDid you bring the keyI have it Stephen said preceding themHe walked on Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grassesDown sir How dare you sirHaines askedDo you pay rent for this towerTwelve quid Buck Mulligan saidTo the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulderThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at lastRather bleak in wintertime I should say Martello you call itBilly Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were onthe sea But ours is the omphalosWhat is your idea of Hamlet Haines asked StephenNo no Buck Mulligan shouted in pain Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up Wait tillI have a few pints in me firstHe turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoatYou couldnt manage it under three pints Kinch could youIt has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longerYou pique my curiosity Haines said amiably Is it some paradoxPooh Buck Mulligan said We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxesIts quite simple He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfatherWhat Haines said beginning to point at Stephen He himselfBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bendingin loose laughter said to Stephens earO shade of Kinch the elder Japhet in search of a fatherWere always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines And it israther long to tellBuck Mulligan walking forward again raised his handsThe sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he saidI mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA ISNT ITBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attiresIts a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt againEyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudentThe seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the MuglinsI read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemusedThe Father and the Son idea The Son striving to be atoned with theFatherBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face Helooked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety Hemoved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD    MY MOTHERS A JEW MY FATHERS A BIRD    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARYHe held up a forefinger of warning  IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAINHe tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and runningforward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYEHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole flutteringhis winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet criesHaines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephenand saidWe oughtnt to laugh I suppose Hes rather blasphemous Im not abeliever myself that is to say Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow doesnt it What did he call it Joseph the JoinerThe ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answeredO Haines said you have heard it beforeThree times a day after meals Stephen said drilyYoure not a believer are you Haines asked I mean a believer in thenarrow sense of the word Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal GodTheres only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen saidHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone He sprang it open with his thumb and offered itThank you Stephen said taking a cigaretteHaines helped himself and snapped the case to He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang itopen too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his handsYes of course he said as they went on again Either you believe oryou dont isnt it Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod You dont stand for that I supposeYou behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horribleexample of

wavering line along thepath They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark He wants thatkey It is mine I paid the rent Now I eat his salt bread Give him thekey too All He will ask for it That

seems to meI am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an ItalianItalian Haines saidA crazy queen old and jealous Kneel down before meAnd a third Stephen said there is who wants me for

hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleadingOn his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshapedrecent and damp as a snails

Mychildhood bends beside me Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly Mine is far and his secret as our eyes Secrets silent stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of

cried continually without listeningCochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen saidWill you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restoreorder hereAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternlyWhat is the matter What is it nowTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many formsclosed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the

ignorance They actedaccording to their lightsFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the NorthCircular road It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such animportant thoroughfare

Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of adreadful catastrophe in New York In America those things werecontinually happening Unfortunate people to die like that unpreparedStill an act of perfect contritionFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergins publichouse against thewindow of which two unlabouring men lounged They saluted him andwere salutedFather Conmee passed H J ONeills funeral

bargeman with a hat of dirtystraw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar abovehim It was idyllic and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of theCreator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out andbring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor peopleOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee SJ of saintFrancis Xaviers church upper Gardiner street stepped on to an outwardbound tramOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas DudleyC C of saint Agathas church north William street on to NewcomenbridgeAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward boundtram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud IslandFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tuckedwith care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings asixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into hispurse Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspectorusually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticketThe solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmeeexcessive for a journey so short and cheap Father Conmee liked cheerfuldecorumIt was a peaceful day The gentleman with the glasses opposite FatherConmee had finished explaining and looked down His wife FatherConmee supposed A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentlemanwith the glasses She raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gentlytiptapping  her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinilysweetlyFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car He perceived alsothat the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge ofthe seatFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in themouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky headAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go anold woman rose suddenly from her place to alight The conductor pulledthe bellstrap to stay the car for her She passed out with her basket anda marketnet and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net andbasket down and Father Conmee thought that as she had nearly passedthe end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had alwaysto be told twice BLESS YOU MY CHILD that they have been absolved PRAYFOR ME But they had so many worries in life so many cares poorcreaturesFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips atFather ConmeeFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellowmen and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver SJ and the African missionand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brownand yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their lasthour came like a thief in the night That book by the Belgian jesuit LENOMBRE DES ELUS seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea Those weremillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom thefaith had not DV been brought But they were Gods souls created byGod It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost awaste if one might sayAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted was saluted by theconductor and

the seas adjoiningThen came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one dayThose were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old timesin the baronyFather Conmee walking thought

ample underleaves The sky showed him a flock ofsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind MOUTONNER the Frenchsaid A just and homely wordFather Conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoningclouds over Rathcoffey His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubbleof Clongowes field He walked there reading in the evening and heard thecries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet eveningHe was their rector his reign was mildFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary outAn ivory bookmark told him the pageNones He should have read that

to murmur to himself in a faltering undertoneGod blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart Blimey itmakes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when I sees her cause Ithinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down Limehouse waySo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and thecorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speaktheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone fora quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump thathe cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and theantitreating league and drink the curse of Ireland Antitreatingis about the size of it Gob hed let you pour all manner of drinkdown his throat till the Lord would call him before youd eversee the froth of his pint And

badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lotof colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medalsand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolaghentertainment dont be talking Ireland sober is Ireland free And thenan old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougersshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of And one or two skypilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the femaleshitting below the beltSo howandever as I was saying the old dog seeing the tin was emptystarts mousing around by Joe and me Id train him by

andgrousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and thehydrophobia dropping out of his jawsAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture amongthe lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of notmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by thefamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the SOBRIQUET ofGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends andacquaintances Owen Garry The exhibition which is the result of years oftraining by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprisesamong other achievements the recitation of verse Our greatest livingphonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stoneunturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and hasfound it bears a STRIKING resemblance the italics are ours to the rannsof ancient Celtic bards We are not speaking so much of those delightfullovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under thegraceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised thebookloving world but rather as a contributor D O C points out in aninteresting communication published by an evening contemporary of theharsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusionsof the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a moremodern lyrist at present very much in the public eye We subjoin aspecimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholarwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose thoughwe believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rathermore than an indication The metrical system of the canine originalwhich recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules ofthe Welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe ourreaders will agree that the spirit has been well caught Perhapsit should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owensverse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestiveof suppressed rancour    THE CURSE OF MY CURSES    SEVEN DAYS EVERY DAY    AND SEVEN DRY THURSDAYS    ON YOU BARNEY KIERNAN    HAS NO SUP OF WATER    TO

like a shot off a shovel          The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysteriousembrace Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of alltoo fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proudpromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay onthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and last but not least on thequiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness thevoice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to thestormtossed heart of man Mary star of the seaThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the eveningscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly Many a time and oftwere they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chatbeside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine Cissy Caffrey andEdy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and JackyCaffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps tomatch and the name HMS Belleisle printed on both For Tommy andJacky Caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiledtwins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merryfaces and endearing ways about them They were dabbling in the sand withtheir spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing withtheir big coloured ball happy as the day was long And Edy Boardman wasrocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that younggentleman fairly chuckled with delight He was but eleven months and ninedays old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp hisfirst babyish words Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fatlittle plucks and the dainty dimple in his chinNow baby Cissy Caffrey said Say out big big I want a drink ofwaterAnd baby prattled after herA jink a jink a jawboCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of childrenso patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got totake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose andpromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrupon What a persuasive power that girl had But to be sure baby Boardmanwas as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib None ofyour spoilt beauties Flora MacFlimsy sort was Cissy CaffreyA truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh inher gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips agirl lovable in the extreme And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaintlanguage of little brotherBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommyand Master Jacky Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exceptionto this golden rule The apple of discord was a certain castle of sandwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrongthat it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like theMartello tower had But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky wasselfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little Irishmans houseis his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that thewouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castletoo Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew theattention of the girl friendsCome here Tommy his sister called imperatively At once And youJacky for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand Wait till I catchyou for thatHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call fortheir big sisters word was law with the twins And in a sad plight he wastoo after his misadventure His little manowar top and unmentionableswere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothingover lifes tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand wasto be seen on his smart little suit Still the blue eyes were glisteningwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness andshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was nearhim she wouldnt be far from him her eyes dancing in admonitionNasty bold Jacky she criedShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winninglyWhats your name Butter and creamTell us who is your sweetheart spoke Edy Boardman Is Cissy yoursweetheartNao tearful Tommy saidIs Edy Boardman your sweetheart Cissy queriedNao Tommy saidI know Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance fromher shortsighted eyes I know who is Tommys sweetheart Gerty isTommys sweetheartNao Tommy said on the verge of tearsCissys quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whisperedto Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where thegentleman couldnt see and to mind he didnt wet his new tan shoesBut who was GertyGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions lost inthought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair aspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see She waspronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said shewas more a Giltrap than a MacDowell Her figure was slight and gracefulinclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking oflate had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welchsfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to getand that tired feeling The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritualin its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupidsbow Greekly perfect Her hands were of finely veined alabasterwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointmentscould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid glovesin bed or take a milk footbath either Bertha Supple told that onceto Edy Boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggersdrawn with Gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffsfrom time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not tolet on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed neverspeak to her again No Honour where honour is due There was aninnate refinement a languid queenly HAUTEUR about Gerty whichwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instepHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree inher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good educationGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in theland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow andpatrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirsto her Mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent toher softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaningthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charmfew could resist Why have women such eyes of witchery Gertys were ofthe bluest Irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressivebrows Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive It wasMadame Vera Verity directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the PrincessNovelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave thathaunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion andshe had never regretted it Then there was blushing scientifically curedand how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face butyour nose That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one ButGertys crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair It was dark brownwith a natural wave in it She had cut it that very morning on accountof the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion ofluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too Thursday for wealth And justnow at Edys words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintestrosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlishshyness that of a surety Gods fair land of Ireland did not holdher equalFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes She wasabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue Inclinationprompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent The pretty lipspouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous littlelaugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning She knewright well noone better what made squinty Edy say that because of himcooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel As perusual somebodys nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycleoff the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of herwindow Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studyinghard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he wasgoing to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he leftthe high school like his brother W E Wylie who was racing in thebicycle races in Trinity college university Little recked he perhapsfor what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimespiercing to the core Yet he was young and perchance he mightlearn to love her in time They were protestants in his familyand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the BlessedVirgin and then Saint Joseph But he was undeniably handsome with anexquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman theshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would knowanywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle atthe lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of thosegood cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she andthat was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever becausehe didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a gardenGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary ofDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might beout A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because itwas expected in the LADYS PICTORIAL that electric blue would be wornwith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocketin which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with herfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and anavy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim gracefulfigure to perfection She wore a coquettish little love of a hat ofwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggbluechenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone All Tuesdayweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at lastshe found what she wanted at Clerys summer sales the very it slightlyshopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny Shedid it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on thensmiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to herAnd when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that thatwould take the shine out of some people she knew Her shoes were thenewest thing in footwear Edy Boardman prided herself that she was veryPETITE but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell a five and neverwould ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle overher higharched instep Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfectproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more ofher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and widegarter tops As for undies they were Gertys chief care and who that knowsthe fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though Gerty wouldnever see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her She hadfour dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments andnighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbonsrosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herselfand blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed themand she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trustthose washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the thingsShe was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her owncolour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhereon her because the green she wore that day week brought grief becausehis father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibitionand because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she wasdressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside outand that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things oninside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so longas it wasnt of a FridayAnd yet and yet That strained look on her face A gnawing sorrow isthere all the time Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worldsto be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way totears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough nottoo much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror You arelovely Gerty it said The paly light of evening falls upon a faceinfinitely sad and wistful Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain Yes she hadknown from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has beenarranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T C Dbecause the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie and inthe fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuousconfection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be He wastoo young to understand He would not believe in love a womansbirthright The night of the party long ago in Stoers he was still inshort trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waistshe went white to the very lips He called her little one in a strangelyhusky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the endof her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark aboutrefreshments Impetuous fellow Strength of character had never been ReggyWylies strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must bea man among men But waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leapyear too and would soon be over No prince charming is her beau ideal tolay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with astrong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightlyflecked with grey and who would understand take her in his shelteringarms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate natureand comfort her with a long long kiss It would be like heaven For sucha one she yearns this balmy summer eve With all the heart of her shelongs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sicknessin health till death us two part from this to this day forwardAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she wasjust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself hislittle wife to be Then they could talk about her till they went blue inthe face Bertha Supple too and Edy little spitfire because she wouldbe twentytwo in November She would care for him with creature comfortstoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked thatfeeling of hominess Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue andqueen Anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions fromall because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in thefine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then creamthe milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt likethe eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often shewondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses andthey would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures andengravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltraps lovely dogGarryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for thechairs and that silver toastrack in Clerys summer jumble sales like theyhave in rich houses He would be tall with broad shoulders she had alwaysadmired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under hiscarefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continentfor their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settleddown in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning theywould both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own twoselves and before he went out to business he would give his dear littlewifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyesEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes sothen she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to runoff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight But Tommysaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with theball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but Tommy said it washis ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if youplease The temper of him O he was a man already was little TommyCaffrey since he was out of pinnies Edy told him no no and to be off nowwith him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to himYoure not my sister naughty Tommy said Its my ballBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up look up high at herfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand andTommy after it in full career having won the dayAnything for a quiet life laughed CissAnd she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heresthe lord mayor heres his two horses heres his gingerbread carriageand here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin But Edygot as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that fromeveryone always petting himId like to give him something she said so I would where I wont sayOn the beeoteetom laughed Cissy merrilyGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissysaying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of herlife to say flushing a deep rosy red and Edy Boardman said she was surethe gentleman opposite heard what she said But not a pin cared CissLet him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of hernose Give it to him too on the same place as quick as Id look at himMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls You had to laugh at hersometimes For instance when she asked you would you have some moreChinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mensfaces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when shewanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit tothe Miss White That was just like Cissycums O and will you ever forgether the evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the burnedcork moustache and walked down Tritonville road smoking a cigaretteThere was none to come up to her for fun But she was sincerity itselfone of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of yourtwofaced things too sweet to be wholesomeAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and thepealing anthem of the organ It was the mens temperance retreat conductedby the missioner the reverend John Hughes S J rosary sermon andbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament They were there gatheredtogether without distinction of social class and a most edifyingspectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the wavesafter the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet ofthe immaculate reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loretobeseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar wordsholy Mary holy virgin of virgins How sad to poor Gertys earsHad her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink bytaking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in PearsonsWeekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none Over andover had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brownstudy without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazingout of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rustybucket thinking But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearthsand homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days Nay she had evenwitnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance andhad seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forgethimself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gertyknew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way ofkindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the lowAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerfulVirgin most merciful And Gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard hercompanions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman offSandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so likehimself passing along the strand taking a short walk You never saw himany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for afather because he was too old or something or on account of his face itwas a palpable case of Doctor Fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimpleson it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose Poor fatherWith all his faults she loved him still when he sang TELL ME MARY HOW TOWOO THEE or MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE and they had stewed cocklesand lettuce with Lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang THEMOON HATH RAISED with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried Godhave mercy on him from a stroke Her mothers birthday that was andCharley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs andPatsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group takenNoone would have thought the end was so near Now he was laid to restAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest ofhis days and he couldnt even go to the funeral on account of the gout andshe had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from hisoffice about Catesbys cork lino artistic standard designs fit for apalace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the homeA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the housea ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in goldAnd when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was itrubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didnt likeher mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thingthey ever had words about taking snuff Everyone thought the world of herfor her gentle ways It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main everynight and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where shenever forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocerschristmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman inthe costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering abunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her latticewindow You could see there was a story behind it The colours were donesomething lovely She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitudeand the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocratShe often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certainpurpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers withthe sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found outin Walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrapabout the halcyon days what they meantThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till atlast Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no gettingbehind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could downtowards the seaweedy rocks Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow tovoice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting thereby himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball Our twochampions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid troubleCissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please Thegentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strandtowards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right underGertys skirt near the little pool by the rock The twins clamoured againfor it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it soGerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt comerolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and CissylaughedIf you fail try again Edy Boardman saidGerty smiled assent and bit her lip A delicate pink crept into herpretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted herskirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jollygood kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towardsthe shingle Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attentionon account of the gentleman opposite looking She felt the warm flush adanger signal always with Gerty MacDowell surging and flaming into hercheeks Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual butnow under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the facethat met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemedto her the saddest she had ever seenThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted andwith it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain oforiginal sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray forus vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose And carewornhearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erredand wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright withhope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the greatsaint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary the most pious Virginsintercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those whoimplored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by herThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles ofchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers Cissy Caffrey played withbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air Peepshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissygone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my worddidnt the little chap enjoy that And then she told him to say papaSay papa baby Say pa pa pa pa pa pa paAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent foreleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of healtha perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to besomething great they saidHaja ja ja hajaCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to situp properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried outholy saint Denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanketthe other way under him Of course his infant majesty was mostobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know itHabaa baaaahabaaa baaaaAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks It was all nouse soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about thegeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss always readywitted gave himin his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen wasquickly appeasedGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out ofthat and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little bratsof twins She gazed out towards the distant sea It was like the paintingsthat man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and sucha pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and theclouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music likethat and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like akind of waft And while she gazed her heart went pitapat Yes it was herhe was looking at and there was meaning in his look His eyes burned intoher as though they would search her through and through read her verysoul Wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trustthem People were so queer She could see at once by his dark eyes and hispale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo shehad of Martin Harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which shepreferred because she wasnt stagestruck like Winny Rippingham thatwanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but shecould not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly RETROUSSE fromwhere he was sitting He was in deep mourning she could see that and thestory of a haunting sorrow was written on his face She would have givenworlds to know what it was He was looking up so intently so still andhe saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel bucklesof her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes downShe was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockingsthinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away Here was that ofwhich she had so often dreamed It was he who mattered and there was joyon her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that hewas like noone else The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him herdreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him If he hadsuffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had beenhimself a sinner a wicked man she cared not Even if he was a protestantor methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her Therewere wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm She was a womanly womannot like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclistsshowing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all toforgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forgetthe memory of the past Then mayhap he would embrace her gently like areal man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girliefor herself aloneRefuge of sinners Comfortress of the afflicted ORA PRO NOBIS Wellhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy cannever be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for theafflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heartGerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glasswindows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of theblessed Virgins sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon OHanlon atthe altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down He lookedalmost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark andhis hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nunin their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novenaof Saint Dominic He told her that time when she told him about that inconfession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could seenot to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we wereall subject to natures laws he said in this life and that that was nosin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God he saidand that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it doneunto me according to Thy Word He was so kind and holy and often and oftenshe thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroideredfloral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock shenoticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came outof a little house to tell the time the day she went there about theflowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know whatsort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views ofDublin or some placeThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jackythrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it Littlemonkeys common as ditchwater Someone ought to take them and give thema good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both ofthem And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because theywere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drownedJacky TommyNot they What a great notion they had So Cissy said it was the verylast time shed ever bring them out She jumped up and called them and sheran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a goodenough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerryshe was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because itwasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it She ranwith long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt atthe side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboyabout Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thoughtshe had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runnershe ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoatrunning and her skinny shanks up as far as possible It would haveserved her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentallyon purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her looktall and got a fine tumble TABLEAU That would have been a very charmingexpose for a gentleman like that to witnessQueen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saintsthey prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handedthe thurible to Canon OHanlon and he put in the incense and censed theBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she wasitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnt becauseshe thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake inall her life because Gerty could see without looking that he nevertook his eyes off of her and then Canon OHanlon handed the thuribleback to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacramentand the choir began to sing the TANTUM ERGO and she just swung her footin and out in time as the music rose and fell to the TANTUMER GOSACRAMEN TUM Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrowsof Georges street on the Tuesday no the Monday before Easter and therewasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparentand not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor formthe cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the differencefor himselfCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball withher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streeltugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only afortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanginglike a caricature Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle herhair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen ona girls shouldersa radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening inits sweetness You would have to travel many a long mile before you founda head of hair the like of that She could almost see the swift answeringflash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerveShe put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim andswung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught theexpression in his eyes He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey Herwomans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at thethought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colourof her face became a glorious roseEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gertyhalf smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse thebaby Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was whynoone could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern ofhers And she said to GertyA penny for your thoughtsWhat replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teethI was only wondering was it lateBecause she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and theirbabby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave agentle hint about its being late And when Cissy came up Edy asked her thetime and Miss Cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissingtime time to kiss again But Edy wanted to know because they were told tobe in earlyWait said Cissy Ill run ask my uncle Peter over there whats the timeby his conundrumSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take hishand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with hiswatchchain looking up at the church Passionate nature though he wasGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself One moment hehad been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and thenext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressedin every line of his distinguishedlooking figureCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was theright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to itand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry hiswatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sunwas set His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke inmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tonesCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle saidhis waterworks were out of orderThen they sang the second verse of the TANTUM ERGO and CanonOHanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down andhe told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fireto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and shecould see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works andshe swung her leg more in and out in time It was getting darker but hecould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch orwhatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands backinto his pockets She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her andshe knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her staysthat that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when sheclipped her hair on account of the moon His dark eyes fixed themselveson her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at hershrine If ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionategaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face It is for youGertrude MacDowell and you know itEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gertynoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect becauseit was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push upthe pushcar and Cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair tomake herself attractive of course and Canon OHanlon stood up with hiscope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to readoff and he read out PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS and Edy and Cissy weretalking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could paythem back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politenesswhen Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing herover Gerty winced sharply A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes thatspoke volumes of scorn immeasurable It hurtO yes it cut deep becauseEdy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would woundlike the confounded little cat she was Gertys lips parted swiftly toframe the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throatso slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artistmight have dreamed of She had loved him better than he knewLighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would neverunderstand what he had meant to her and for an instant there wasin the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears Their eyes wereprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back insympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to seeO responded Gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud headflashed up I can throw my cap at who I like because its leap yearHer words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of theringdove but they cut the silence icily There was that in her youngvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled withAs for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could justchuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would shecast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcardinto a dozen pieces And if ever after he dared to presume shecould give him one look of measured scorn that would make himshrivel up on the spot Miss puny little Edys countenance fell tono slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black asthunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it thelittle kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousyand they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another spherethat she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody elsetoo that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipeand smoke itEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissytucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time toobecause the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior AndCissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to godeedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleefuleyes and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy andbaby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to alland sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bibO my Puddeny pie protested Ciss He has his bib destroyedThe slight CONTRETEMPS claimed her attention but in two twos she setthat little matter to rightsGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough andEdy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it wasflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed itoff with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction becausejust then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashorebecause Canon OHanlon was up on the altar with the veil that FatherConroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the BlessedSacrament in his handsHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse ofErin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a batflew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with atiny lost cry And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses sopicturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it waseasier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going hisrounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shadyTritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near herwindow where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in thatbook THE LAMPLIGHTER by Miss Cummins author of MABEL VAUGHAN andother tales For Gerty had her dreams that noone knew of She loved toread poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovelyconfession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in shelaid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not erron the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean It was thereshe kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs herchild of Mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine heralabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things camehome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts writtenin it in violet ink that she bought in Helys of Dame Street forshe felt that she too could write poetry if she could only expressherself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she hadcopied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs ARTTHOU REAL MY IDEAL it was called by Louis J Walsh Magherafelt andafter there was something about TWILIGHT WILT THOU EVER and ofttimesthe beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had mistedher eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slippingby for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew sheneed fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkeyhill and she always tried to conceal it But it must end she feltIf she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holdingback for her Love laughs at locksmiths She would make the greatsacrifice Her every effort would be to share his thoughts Dearer thanthe whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happinessThere was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he amarried man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like thenobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her putinto a madhouse cruel only to be kind But even ifwhat then Would itmake a very great difference From everything in the least indelicate herfinebred nature instinctively recoiled She loathed that sort of personthe fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that wentwith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girls honourdegrading the sex and being taken up to the police station No no notthat They would be just good friends like a big brother and sisterwithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a bigess Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the daysbeyond recall She thought she understood She would try to understandhim because men were so different The old love was waiting waitingwith little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes Heartof mine She would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heartthat told her he was her all in all the only man in all the worldfor her for love was the master guide Nothing else mattered Come whatmight she would be wild untrammelled freeCanon OHanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacleand genuflected and the choir sang LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES andthen he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over andFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasntshe coming but Jacky Caffrey called outO look CissyAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too overthe trees beside the church blue and then green and purpleIts fireworks Cissy Caffrey saidAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and thechurch helterskelter Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it andCissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldnt fall runningCome on Gerty Cissy called Its the bazaar fireworksBut Gerty was adamant She had no intention of being at their beck andcall If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she couldsee from where she was The eyes that were fastened upon her sether pulses tingling She looked at him a moment meeting his glanceand a light broke in upon her Whitehot passion was in that face passionsilent as the grave and it had made her his At last they were leftalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew hecould be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man ofinflexible honour to his fingertips His hands and face were workingand a tremour went over her She leaned back far to look up wherethe fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as notto fall back looking up and there was noone to see only him andher when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like thatsupply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the pantingof his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passionof men like that hotblooded because Bertha Supple told her once in deadsecret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that wasstaying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had picturescut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said heused to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes inthe bed But this was altogether different from a thing like thatbecause there was all the difference because she could almost feelhim draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of hishandsome lips Besides there was absolution so long as you didntdo the other thing before being married and there ought to bewomen priests that would understand without your telling out andCissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy lookin her eyes so that she too my dear and Winny Rippingham so madabout actors photographs and besides it was on account of that otherthing coming on the way it didAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned backand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and theyall saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leanedback ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flyingthrough the air a soft thing to and fro dark And she saw a long Romancandle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hushthey were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higherand she had to lean back more and more to look up after it highhigh almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divinean entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her otherthings too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skinbetter than those other pettiwidth the green four and elevenon account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and thenit went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling inevery limb from being bent so far back that he had a full viewhigh up above her knee where noone ever not even on the swing or wadingand she wasnt ashamed and he wasnt either to look in that immodest waylike that because he couldnt resist the sight of the wondrous revealmenthalf offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemenlooking and he kept on looking looking She would fain have cried to himchokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel hislips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girls love a littlestrangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the agesAnd then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O then the Romancandle burst and it was like a sigh of O and everyone cried O O inraptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads andthey shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with goldenO so lovely O soft sweet softThen all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent Ah Sheglanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance ofpiteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girlHe was leaning back against the rock behind Leopold Bloom for it is hestands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes What abrute he had been At it again A fair unsullied soul had called to himand wretch that he was how had he answered An utter cad he had beenHe of all men But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyesfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned andwandered Should a girl tell No a thousand times no That was theirsecret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none toknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the eveningto and fro and little bats dont tellCissy Caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to showwhat a great person she was and then she criedGerty Gerty Were going Come on We can see from farther upGerty had an idea one of loves little ruses She slipped a hand intoher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of coursewithout letting him and then slipped it back Wonder if hes too far toShe rose Was it goodbye No She had to go but they would meet againthere and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream ofyester eve She drew herself up to her full height Their souls met in alast lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of astrange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face She halfsmiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged ontears and then they partedSlowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand toCissy to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey to little baby Boardman It wasdarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippyseaweed She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her butwith care and very slowly becausebecause Gerty MacDowell was Tight boots No Shes lame OMr

woman that lay therein childbed The nursingwoman answered him and said that that womanwas in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unnethto bear but that now in a little it would be She said thereto that shehad seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was thatwomans birth Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew theman that time was had lived nigh that house The man hearkened to herwords for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have ofmotherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face forany man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid Ninetwelve bloodflows chiding her childlessAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and therenighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat And therecame against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept DixonAnd the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that theyhad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where thislearningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healedfor he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible anddreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve ofvolatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice And he said now thathe should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that werethere And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither forhe was a man of cautels and a subtile Also the lady was of his avis andrepreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller hadsaid thing that was false for his subtility But the learningknight wouldnot hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious tohis list and he said how it was a marvellous castle And the travellerLeopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore oflimb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime veneryAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood ofFinlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but theydurst not move more for enchantment And on this board were frightfulswords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons outof white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags thatthere abound marvellously And there were vessels that are wrought bymagic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breaththat he blases in to them like to bubbles And full fair cheer and richwas on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer And therewas a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which laystrange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that thisbe possible thing without they see it natheless they are so And thesefishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land becauseof the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepressAnd also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they makea compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid ofcertain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously liketo a vast mountain And they teach the serpents there to entwinethemselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales ofthese serpents they brew out a brewage like to meadAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halpthereto the while all they that were there drank every each And childeLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat inamity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by andanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and hisneighbour nist not of this wile And he sat down in that castle with themfor to rest him there awhile Thanked be Almighty GodThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them atthe reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing forthere was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fastSir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry thatit was whether of child or woman and I marvel said he that it be notcome or now Meseems it dureth overlong And he was ware and saw afranklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than anyof the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the oneemprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gentlyBut said he or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty andhave joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long And thefranklin that had drunken said Expecting each moment to be her nextAlso he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never noneasking nor desiring of him to drink and Now drink said he fullydelectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths healthfor he was a passing good man of his lustiness And sir Leopoldthat was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall andthat was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandlyhand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the worldone that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly inthe cup Womans woe with wonder ponderingNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to bedrunken an they might There was a sort of scholars along either side theboard that is to wit Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciables withother his fellows Lynch and Madden scholars of medicine and the franklinthat hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa one Crotthers and youngStephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board andCostello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of himerewhile gested and of all them reserved young Stephen he was the mostdrunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sirLeopold But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised tohave come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had brokehis avow And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendshipto sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languorbecalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feastedhim for that time in the honourablest manner Ruth red him love ledon with will to wander loth to leaveFor they were right witty scholars And he heard their aresouns eachgen other as touching birth and righteousness young Madden maintainingthat put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen outa matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Hornes house thatnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before herdeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case And theysaid farther she should live because in the beginning they said thewoman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of thisimagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscienceto let her die And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubtthat the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeitthe mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges didprovide no remedy A redress God grant This was scant said but all criedwith one acclaim nay by our Virgin Mother the wife should live and thebabe to die In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what withargument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompteach when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lackThen young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she wasdead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and fora vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband wouldnot let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved To whom youngStephen had these words following Murmur sirs is eke oft among layfolk Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker the one in limbogloom the other in purgefire But gramercy what of those Godpossibledsouls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the HolyGhost Very God Lord and Giver of Life For sirs he said our lustis brief We are means to those small creatures within us and naturehas other ends than we Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wisthe what ends But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he couldhave of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she wereor wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of hisspleen of lustihead Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang youngMalachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millenniumhe cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward withtheir jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and severalby saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any mannerof thing that lay in man to do Thereat laughed they all rightjocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laughtoo open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray andalso for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoeverThen spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast himout of her bosom of law of canons of Lilith patron of abortions of bignesswrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth tomouth or as Virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reekof moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain withEFFECTU SECUTO or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions ofAverroes and Moses Maimonides He said also how at the end of the secondmonth a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldethever souls for Gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which wasbut a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeththe fishermans seal even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy churchfor all ages founded All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would hein like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life A wariness ofmind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he saiddissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had everloved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with hisexperience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Churchbelike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly hescaped their questions That is truth pardy said Dixon and or I erra pregnant word Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man andhe averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for hewas of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in thattaking it appeared eftsoonsBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he stillhad pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labourand as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an onlymanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of artcould save so dark is destiny And she was wondrous stricken of heart forthat evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambswool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lieakeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now SirLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him hisfriends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness andas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for allaccounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure foryoung Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels andmurdered his goods with whoresAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood emptyso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed theirapproach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for theintentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicarof Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray Now drink we quod heof this mazer and quaff ye this mead

hospitality that wassending over Doctor Rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in allMuscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull bythe horns Come come says Mr Vincent plain dealing Hell find himselfon the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats Irish says heIrish by name and irish by nature says Mr Stephen and he sent the alepurling about an Irish bull in an English chinashop I conceive you saysMr Dixon It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmerNicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emeraldring in his nose True for you says Mr Vincent cross the tableand a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlierbull says he never shit on shamrock He had horns galore a coat ofcloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils sothat the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpinsfollowed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychainsWhat for that says Mr Dixon but before he came over farmerNicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctorswho were no better off than himself So be off now says he and do all mycousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmers blessing andwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly But the slap and theblessing stood him friend says Mr Vincent for to make up he taught him atrick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to thisday affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his earin the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holytongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the fourfields of all Ireland Another then put in his word And they dressed himsays he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle andruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all overwith spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of theroad with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the marketso that he could doss and dung to his hearts content By this timethe father of the faithful for so they called him was grown soheavy that he could scarce walk to pasture To remedy which ourcozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlapsand as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uartersto show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bullslanguage and they all after him Ay says another and so pampered was hethat he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass forhimself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a boardput up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed noticesaying By the Lord Harry Green is the grass that grows on the groundAnd says Mr Dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommonor the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowingas much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed runamok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whateverwas planted and all by lord Harrys orders There was bad blood betweenthem at first says Mr Vincent and the lord Harry called farmerNicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster thatkept seven trulls in his house and Ill meddle in his matterssays he Ill make that animal smell hell says he with the helpof that good pizzle my father left me But one evening says MrDixon when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinnerafter winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first ruleof the course was that the others were to row with pitchforkshe discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on pickingup a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sureenough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bullof the Romans BOS BOVUM which is good bog Latin for boss of theshow After that says Mr Vincent the lord Harry put his head intoa cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers andpulling it out again told them all his new name Then with the waterrunning off him he got into an old smock and skirt that hadbelonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bullslanguage to study but he could never learn a word of it except the firstpersonal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if everhe went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it uponwhat took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale ofcotton or a corkfloat In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon asfast friends as an arse and a shirt They were says Mr Stephen and theend was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as theungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselvesand their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect mannedthe yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the windput her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ranup the jolly Roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushedoff in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of AmericaWhich was the occasion says Mr Vincent of the composing by a boatswainof that

with a friendwhom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name Alec Bannonwho had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or acornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars Mr Mulligan was civilenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with aproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched onWhereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which hehad had printed that day at Mr Quinnells bearing a legend printed in fairitalics MR MALACHI MULLIGAN FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR LAMBAY ISLAND Hisproject as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idlepleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sirMilksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task forwhich our bodily organism has been framed Well let us hear of it goodmy friend said Mr Dixon I make no doubt it smacks of wenching Come beseated both Tis as cheap sitting as standing Mr Mulligan accepted ofthe invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that hehad been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes ofsterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibitionin its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of thebalance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defectscongenital or from proclivities acquired It grieved him plaguily hesaid to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and toreflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to thevilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenialcloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountablemuskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing theinestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows wereat hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weepTo curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppressionof latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worthand inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in feesimple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holderlord Talbot de Malahide a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with ourascendancy party He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farmto be named OMPHALOS with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion ofEgypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of anyfemale of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him withthe desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural Money was noobject he said nor would he take a penny for his pains The poorestkitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be theirconstructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitionswould find in him their man For his nutriment he shewed how he wouldfeed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish andconeys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highlyrecommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade ofmace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies After this homily which hedelivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put offfrom his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it They both itseems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pacehad taken water as might be observed by Mr Mulligans smallclothes of ahodden grey which was now somewhat piebald His project meanwhile wasvery favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies fromall though Mr Dixon of Marys excepted to it asking with a finicking airdid he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle Mr Mulligan however madecourt to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which asit dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support ofhis contention TALIS AC TANTA DEPRAVATIO HUJUS SECULI O QUIRITES UTMATRESFAMILIARUM NOSTRAE LASCIVAS CUJUSLIBET SEMIVIRI LIBICI

overjoyed as he was at apassage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell ithis nearest neighbour Mr Mulligan now perceiving the table asked forwhom were those loaves and fishes and seeing

replied that he was comethere about a lady now an inmate of Hornes house that was in aninteresting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetcheda deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet

create themselves wits at the cost of femininedelicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he wouldconcede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a properbreeding

while the above was goingon were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation wasas astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjecturedthe contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrongshop During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hardat a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co atBurtononTrent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of othersright opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated toattract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance He wassimply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best knownto himself which put quite an altogether different complexion onthe proceedings after the moment befores observations about boyhooddays and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions ofhis own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babeunborn Eventually however both their eyes met and as soon asit began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to helphimself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himselfand so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glassrecipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacioushole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same timehowever a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upsetany of the beer that was in it about the placeThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome ofthe course of life Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity Thedebaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on theloftiest and most vital The high hall of Hornes house had never beheld anassembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of

young poet who found a refuge from his labours ofpedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere ofSocratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated theflippant

no lureor peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of thatvoluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned forages yet to comeIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the pervertedtranscendentalism to which Mr S Dedalus Div Scep contentions wouldappear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to acceptedscientific methods Science it cannot be too often repeated deals withtangible phenomena The man of science like the man in the street has toface hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best hecan There may be it is true some questions which science cannotanswerat presentsuch as the first problem submitted by Mr L Bloom PubbCanv regarding the future determination of sex Must we accept the viewof Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual periodassert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too longneglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it asmost embryologists incline to opine such as Culpepper SpallanzaniBlumenbach Lusk Hertwig Leopold and Valenti a mixture of both Thiswould be tantamount to a cooperation one of natures favourite devicesbetween the NISUS FORMATIVUS of the nemasperm on the one hand and on theother a happily chosen position SUCCUBITUS FELIX of the passive element Theother

isundoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting tocount the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to benormative In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder isthat so

IVORY CANE WITH A VIOLETBOWKNOT A WHITE LAMBKIN PEEPS OUT OF HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET     III Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulkof the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked himup generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly neededHis Stephens mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but abit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink MrBloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry wateravailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon anexpedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabmansshelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridgewhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk andsoda or a mineral But how to get there was the rub For the nonce he wasrather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him totake some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means duringwhich Stephen repeatedly yawned So far as he could see he was rather palein the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyanceof some description which would answer in their then condition both ofthem being eded particularly Stephen always assuming that there wassuch a thing to be found Accordingly after a few such preliminaries asbrushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddyhandkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they bothwalked together along Beaver street or more properly lane as far as thefarriers and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at thecorner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thencedebouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergins But ashe confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hireanywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by somefellows inside on the spree outside the North Star hotel and there was nosymptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom who wasanything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting akind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twiceThis was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on itevidently there was nothing for it butput a good face on the matter and footit which they accordingly did So bevelling around by Mulletts and theSignal House which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in thedirection of Amiens street railway terminus Mr Bloom being handicappedby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to varythe timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though enteringthoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of themischance So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as ithappened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recentvisitation of Jupiter Pluvius they dandered along past by where the emptyvehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey As it so happened a DublinUnited Tramways Companys sandstrewer happened to be returning andthe elder man recounted to his companion A PROPOS of the incident his owntruly miraculous escape of some little while back They passed the mainentrance of the Great Northern railway station the starting point forBelfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour andpassing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to saygruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the DockTavern and in due course turned into Store street famous for itsC division police station Between this point and the high at present unlitwarehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsenassociated with Bairds the stonecutters in his mind somehow in Talbotplace first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidusAchates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourkes citybakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odourindeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary andmost indispensable Bread the staff of life earn your bread O tell me whereis fancy bread at Rourkes the bakers it is saidEn route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yetperfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in completepossession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spokea word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swellmobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as ahabitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for youngfellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits underthe influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for everycontingencyas even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick ifyou didnt look out Highly providential was the appearance on the scene ofCorny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that manin the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that hemight have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that thebridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or hebeing the solicitor rather old Wall he meant to say or Mahony whichsimply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about The reason hementioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordiallydisliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and asMr Bloom put it recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassilstreet prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot Never on the spotwhen wanted but in quiet parts of the city Pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being theywere paid to protect the upper classes Another thing he commented on wasequipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to gooff at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civiliansshould by any chance they fall out over anything You frittered away yourtime he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besideswhich the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ranaway with a lot of l s d into the bargain and the greatest danger of all waswho you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question ofstimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably agood burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond acertain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to troubleall round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of otherspractically Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephenby all his pubhunting confreres but one a most glaring piece of ratting onthe part of his brother medicos under all the circsAnd that one was Judas Stephen said who up to then had said nothingwhatsoever of any kindDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across theback of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where abrazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like oneattracted their rather lagging footsteps Stephen of his own accord stoppedfor no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by thelight emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure ofthe corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox He began toremember that this had happened or had been mentioned as havinghappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered thathe recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his fathers Gumley Toavoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridgeSomeone saluted you Mr Bloom saidA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the archessaluted again callingNightStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return thecompliment Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuchas he always believed in minding his own business moved off butnevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety thoughnot funkyish in the least Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew thatit was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothingto live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceablepedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outsidethe city proper famished loiterers of the Thames embankment categorythey might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decampwith whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments noticeyour money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged andgarrottedStephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quartersthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corleys breathredolent of rotten cornjuice Lord John Corley some called him and hisgenealogy came about in this wise He was the eldest son of inspectorCorley of the G division lately deceased who had married a certainKatherine Brophy the daughter of a Louth farmer His grandfatherPatrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publicanthere whose maiden name had been Katherine also Talbot Rumour had itthough not proved that she descended from the house of the lords Talbotde Malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence ofits kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative awoman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction ofbeing in service in the washkitchen This therefore was the reason why thestill comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressedStephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord JohnCorleyTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tellNot as much as a farthing to purchase a nights lodgings His friends hadall deserted him Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him toStephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of otheruncalledfor expressions He was out of a job and implored of Stephen totell him where on Gods earth he could get something anything at all to doNo it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that wasfostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through themother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if thewhole thing wasnt a complete fabrication from start to finish Anyhow hewas all inI wouldnt ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and God knowsIm on the rocksTherell be a job tomorrow or next day Stephen told him in a boysschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher Mr Garrett Deasy Try it You maymention my nameAh God Corley replied sure I couldnt teach in a school man I wasnever one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh I got stuck twicein the junior at the christian brothersI have no place to sleep myself Stephen informed himCorley at the first gooff was inclined to suspect it was something todo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart offthe street There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street Mrs Maloneysbut it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but MConachie toldhim you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavernstreet which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friarBacon for a bob He was starving too though he hadnt said a word about itThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near itstill Stephens feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew thatCorleys brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deservingof much credence However haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere discoetcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he gotpaid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which wasthe date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of thewherewithal was demolished But the cream of the joke was nothing wouldget it out of Corleys head that he was living in affluence and hadnt a thingto do but hand out the needful Whereas He put his hand in a pocketanyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he mightlend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at allevents and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for tohis chagrin he found his cash missing A few broken biscuits were all theresult of his investigation He tried his hardest to recollect for the momentwhether he had lost as well he might have or left because in thatcontingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact Hewas altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he triedto recollect About biscuits he dimly remembered Who now exactly gavethem he wondered or where was or did he buy However in another pockethe came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneouslyhowever as it turned outThose are halfcrowns man Corley corrected himAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be Stephen anyhow lenthim one of themThanks Corley answered youre a gentleman Ill pay you back onetime Whos that with you I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse inCamden street with Boylan the billsticker You might put in a good wordfor us to get me taken on there Id carry a sandwichboard only the girl inthe office told me theyre full up for the next three weeks man God youveto book ahead man youd think it was for the Carl Rosa I dont give ashite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeperSubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two andsix he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of BagsComisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullams theshipchandlers bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Naglesback with OMara and a little chap with a stutter the name of TigheAnyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunkand disorderly and refusing to go with the constableMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of thecobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporationwatchmans sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him washaving a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own privateaccount while Dublin slept He threw an odd eye at the same time now andthen at Stephens anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if hehad seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in aposition to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when Being alevelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewdobservation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchywearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity Palpably hewas one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a questionof one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to putit a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chancedto be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a finewould be a very rara avis altogether In any case he had a consummateamount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night ormorning Pretty thick that was certainlyThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who withhis practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to theblandiloquence of the other parasite Alluding to the encounter he saidlaughingly Stephen that isHe is down on his luck He asked me to ask you to ask somebody namedBoylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichmanAt this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest MrBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in thedirection of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblanamoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repairwhereupon he observed evasivelyEverybody gets their own ration of luck they say Now you mention ithis face was familiar to me But leaving that for the moment how much didyou part with he queried if I am not too inquisitiveHalf a crown Stephen responded I daresay he needs it to sleepsomewhereNeeds Mr Bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at theintelligence I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariablydoes Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deedsBut talking about things in general where added he with a smile will yousleep yourself Walking to Sandycove is out of the question And evensupposing you did you wont get in after what occurred at Westland Rowstation Simply fag out there for nothing I dont mean to presume to dictateto you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your fathers houseTo seek misfortune was Stephens answerI met your respected father on a recent occasion Mr Bloomdiplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate onyesterday Where does he live at present I gathered in the course ofconversation that he had movedI believe he is in Dublin somewhere Stephen answered unconcernedlyWhyA gifted man Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior in more respects thanone and a born raconteur if ever there was one He takes great pride quitelegitimate out of you You could go back perhaps he hasarded stillthinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when itwas perfectly evident that the other two Mulligan that is and that Englishtourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion werepatently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to giveStephen the slip in the confusion which they didThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however suchas it was Stephens minds eye being too busily engaged in repicturing hisfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by theingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa thatwas in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink itwith the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten attwo a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy Boody and Katey the catmeanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fishheads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the thirdprecept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it beingquarter tense or if not ember days or something like thatNo Mr Bloom repeated again I wouldnt personally repose much trust inthat boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element DrMulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes Heknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he neverrealised what it is to be without regular meals Of course you didnt noticeas much as I did But it wouldnt occasion me the least surprise to learn thata pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulteriorobjectHe understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was aversatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who wasrapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified badefair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tonymedical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition towhich professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning byartificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries or Malahidewas it was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which hecould not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss tofathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it downto sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simpleExcept it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call pickingyour brains he ventured to throw outThe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented byfriendliness which he gave at Stephens at present morose expression offeatures did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem asto whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or threelowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through theaffair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed mattersto more or less Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more thanconjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed heexperienced no little difficulty in making both ends meetAdjacent to the mens public urinal they perceived an icecream carround which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation weregetting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in aparticularly animated way there being some little differences between thepartiesPuttana madonna che ci dia i quattrini Ho ragione Culo rottoIntendiamoci Mezzo sovrano piu Dice lui peroMezzoFarabutto Mortacci suiMa ascolta Cinque la testa piu Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabmans shelter anunpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if everbeen before the former having previously whispered to the latter a fewhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous SkintheGoatFitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual factswhich quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in A few momentslater saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to begreeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs andstrays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already thereengaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom theyseemingly formed an object of marked curiosityNow touching a cup of coffee Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest tobreak the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape ofsolid food say a roll of some

it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds itThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this teteatete put a boilingswimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and arather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed After which he beata retreat to his counter Mr Bloom determining to have a good square lookat him later on so as not to appear to For which reason he encouragedStephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiouslypushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffeegradually nearer himSounds are impostures Stephen said after a pause of some little time likenames Cicero Podmore Napoleon Mr Goodbody Jesus Mr DoyleShakespeares were as common as Murphies Whats in a nameYes to be sure Mr Bloom unaffectedly

turned to the other occupants of the shelter withthe remarkI seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over hisshoulder The lefthand dead shotThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and hisgestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explainBottles out there say Fifty yards measured Eggs on the bottles Cockshis gun over his shoulder AimsHe

husband D B MurphyThe sailor who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident turned toone of the jarvies with the requestYou dont happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about youThe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a dieof plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object waspassed from hand to handThank you the sailor saidHe deposited the quid in his

that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extentbut he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he hadconsistently remained a landlubber except you call going to

on account of them usingknivesAt this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance isbliss Mr B and Stephen each in his own particular way both instinctivelyexchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nousvariety however towards where SkintheGoat alias the keeper notturning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair Hisinscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itselfbeggaring description conveyed the impression that he didnt understandone jot of what was going on Funny veryThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause One man was reading in fitsand starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with thenatives choza de another the seamans discharge Mr Bloom so far as hewas personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood He vividlyrecollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterdayroughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubleswhen it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in theeighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteenAy boss the sailor broke in Give us back them papersThe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrapeHave you seen the rock of Gibraltar Mr Bloom inquiredThe sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ayor noAh youve touched there too Mr Bloom said Europa point thinking hehad in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but hefailed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust andshook his head with a sort of lazy scornWhat year would that be about Mr B interrogated Can you recall theboatsOur soidisant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily beforeansweringIm tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships Saltjunk all the timeTired seemingly he ceased His questioner perceiving that he was notlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell towoolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globesuffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it coveredfully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant torule the waves On more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near theNorth Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidentlyderelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on thewall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woodsand pastures new as someone somewhere sings And it left him wondering whyPossibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up anddown the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well notexactly under tempting the fates And the odds were twenty to nil there wasreally no secret about it at all Nevertheless without going into theminutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there inall its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had tosail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show howpeople usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow likethe hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically thesame lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was ahighly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter whereliving inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to themlike that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters andcoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid theelements whatever the season when duty called Ireland expects that every manand so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime notforgetting the Irish lights Kish and others liable to capsize at any momentrounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkablychoppy not to say stormy weatherThere was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover the old seadog himselfa rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentlemansvalet at six quid a month Them are his trousers Ive on me and he gave mean oilskin and that jackknife Im game for that job shaving and brushupI hate roaming about Theres my son now Danny run off to sea and hismother got him took in a drapers in Cork where he could be drawing easymoneyWhat age is he queried one hearer who by the way seen from the sidebore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell the townclerk away fromthe carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and astrong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendageWhy the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son DannyHed be about eighteen now way I figure itThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or uncleananyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on whichwas to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to representan anchorThere was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts Imust get a wash tomorrow or next day Its them black lads I objects to Ihate those buggers Suck your blood dry they doesSeeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly draggedhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of themariners hope and rest they had a full view of the figure  and a youngmans sideface looking frowningly ratherTattoo the exhibitor explained That was done when we were Iyingbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow thename of Antonio done that There he is himself a GreekDid it hurt much doing it one asked the sailorThat worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round theSomeway in his Squeezing orSee here he said showing Antonio There he is cursing the mate Andthere he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with hisfingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarnAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonios livid face didactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited theunreserved admiration of everybody including SkintheGoat who thistime stretched overAy ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest Hes gonetoo Ate by sharks after Ay ayHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expressionof beforeNeat bit of work one longshoreman saidAnd whats the number for loafer number two queriedEaten alive a third asked the sailorAy ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time withsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction ofthe questioner about the number Ate A Greek he wasAnd then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering hisalleged endAs bad as old AntonioFor he left me on my ownioThe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black strawhat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring onher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill Mr Bloomscarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the momentflusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheetof the Abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid asidehe picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink Hisreason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door thesame face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormondquay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady inthe brown costume does be with you Mrs B and begged the chance of hiswashing Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not yourwashing Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wifesundergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did tooa mans similar garments initialled with Bewley and Drapers marking inkhers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me lovemy dirty shirt Still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the femalesroom more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keepermade her a rude sign to take herself off Round the side of the EveningTelegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of thedoor with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactlyall there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers roundskipper Murphys nautical chest and then there was no more of herThe gunboat the keeper saidIt beats me Mr Bloom confided to Stephen medically I am speaking howa wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with diseasecan be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if hevalues his health in the least Unfortunate creature Of course I supposesome man is ultimately responsible for her condition Still no matter whatthe cause is from Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merelyremarkingIn this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaringtrade Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soulShe is a bad merchant She buys dear and sells cheapThe elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or aprude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put astop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from anyoldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil w ere notlicensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he couldtruthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from thevery first start Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said andventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybodyconcernedYou as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe inthe soul Or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such asdistinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup I believein that myself because it has been explained by competent men as theconvolutions of the grey matter Otherwise we would never have suchinventions as X rays for instance Do youThus cornered Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memoryto try and concentrate and remember before he could sayThey tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and thereforeincorruptible It would be immortal I understand but for the possibility ofits annihilation by its First Cause Who from all I can hear is quite capableof adding that to the number of His other practical jokes corruptio per seand corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquetteMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though themystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he feltbound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoiningSimple I shouldnt think that is the proper word Of course I grant youto concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moonBut what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to inventthose rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison though I believe it wasbefore his time Galileo was the man I mean and the same applies to thelaws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricitybut its a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existenceof a supernatural GodO that Stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several ofthe bestknown passages in Holy Writ apart from circumstantial evidenceOn this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as theywere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference intheir respective ages clashedHas been the more experienced of the two objected sticking to hisoriginal point with a smile of unbelief Im not so sure about that Thats amatter for everymans opinion and without dragging in the sectarian sideof the business I beg to differ with you in toto there My belief is to tellyou the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them putin by monks most probably or its the big question of our national poet overagain who precisely wrote them like Hamlet and Bacon as you who knowyour Shakespeare infinitely better than I of course I neednt tell you Cantyou drink that coffee by the way Let me stir it And take a piece of thatbun Its like one of our skippers bricks disguised Still noone can givewhat he hasnt got Try a bitCouldnt Stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the momentrefusing to dictate furtherFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well tostir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with somethingapproaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance andlucrative work To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or naydid a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run onteetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and usefullectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders On theother hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wifeMadam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it atone time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying Theidea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profitthere being no competition to speak of Sulphate of copper poison SO orsomething in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheapeatinghouse somewhere but he couldnt remember when it was or whereAnyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him morethan ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr TibblesViCocoa on account of the medical analysis involvedHave a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mugfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle andtook a sip of the offending beverageStill its solid food his good genius urged Im a stickler for solid foodhis one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regularmeals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manualYou ought to eat more solid food You would feel a different manLiquids I can eat Stephen said But O oblige me by taking away thatknife I cant look at the point of it It reminds me of Roman historyMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminatedarticle a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularlyRoman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was theleast conspicuous point about itOur mutual friends stories are like himself Mr Bloom apropos of knivesremarked to his confidante sotto voce Do you think they are genuine Hecould spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old bootsLook at himYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was fullof a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quitewithin the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication thoughat first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he gotoff his chest being strictly accurate gospelHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of himand Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him Thougha wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness therewas something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail deliveryand it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such aweirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity He mighteven have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as peopleoften did about others namely that he killed him himself and had servedhis four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of theAntonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical namewho sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes inthe melodramatic manner above described On the other hand he might beonly bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugsDublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would temptany ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow aboutthe schooner Hesperus and etcetera And when all was said and done thelies a fellow told about himself couldnt probably hold a proverbial candleto the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about himMind you Im not saying that its all a pure invention he resumedAnalogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with Giants thoughthat is rather a far cry you see once in a way Marcella the midget queen Inthose waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs as they arecalled sitting bowlegged they couldnt straighten their legs if you paidthem because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on hiscompanion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call thembehind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so longcramped up being adored as gods Theres an example again of simplesoulsHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventureswho reminded him a bit of Ludwig alias Ledwidge when he occupied theboards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with themanagement in the Flying Dutchman a stupendous success and his host ofadmirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear himthough ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell abit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatibleabout it he conceded On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quitein keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free toadmit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chippotato variety and so forth over in little

Spanish half that is Point of fact she could actually claimSpanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically Spainie Gibraltar She has the Spanish type Quite dark regular brunette blackI for one certainly believe climate accounts for character Thats why Iasked you if you wrote your poetry in ItalianThe temperaments at the door Stephen interposed with were verypassionate about ten shillings Roberto ruba roba suaQuite so Mr Bloom dittoedThen Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknownlistener somewhere we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isoscelestriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san TommasoMastinoIts in the blood Mr Bloom acceded at once All are washed in the bloodof the sun Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it and I was justlooking at those antique statues there The splendid proportions of hipsbosom You simply dont knock against those kind of women here An exceptionhere and there Handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what Imtalking about is the female form Besides they have so little taste in dressmost of them which greatly enhances a womans natural beauty no matterwhat you say Rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine butstill its a thing I simply hate to seeInterest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and thenthe others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog goocollisions with icebergs all that sort of thing Shipahoy of course had hisown say to say He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered amonsoon a kind of wind in the China seas and through all those perils ofthe deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to thateffect a pious medal he had that saved himSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunts rock wreckof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for themoment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbellremembered it Palme on Booterstown strand That was the talk of the townthat year Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times breakers running overher and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified withhorror Then someone said something about the case of the s s LadyCairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack inrather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck No aid was givenHer master the Monas said he was afraid his collision bulkhead wouldgive way She had no water it appears in her holdAt this stage an incident happened It having become necessary forhim to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seatLet me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was justgently dropping off into a peaceful dozeHe made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to thedoor stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter andbore due left While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom whonoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ships rumsticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burninginterior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applyingits nozze to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with agurgling noise The irrepressible Bloom who also had a shrewd suspicionthat the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction inthe shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents andpurposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by hisrum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop linerather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since hislast visit and greatly improved Some person or persons invisible directed himto the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place forthe purpose but

Japs were going to have their little lookin heaffirmed The Boers were the beginning of the end Brummagem Englandwas toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland her Achilles heelwhich he

noIrishman worthy of his salt that served it Then they began to have a fewirascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to thelisteners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as theydidnt indulge in recriminations and come to blowsFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloomwas rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdashfor pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for hewas fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channelunless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealedtheir strength than the opposite It was quite on a par with the quixotic ideain certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of thesister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out tobe how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as ahost of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then itwas highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countrieseven though poles apart Another little interesting point the amours ofwhores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him Irishsoldiers had as often fought for England as against her more so in factAnd now why So the scene between the pair of them the licensee of theplace rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris the famous invincible andthe other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours withthe confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookerona student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the gameAnd as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasnt the other person at allhe B couldnt help feeling and most properly it was better to give peoplelike that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse tohave anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and theirfelonsetting there always being the offchance of a Dannyman comingforward and turning queens evidence or kings now like Denis or PeterCarey an idea he utterly repudiated Quite apart from that he dislikedthose careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle Yet though suchcriminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shapeor form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remainingwhat he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actuallybrandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictionsthough personally he would never be a party to any such thing off thesame bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for herwhen the husband frequently after some words passed between the twoconcerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had thepair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of analternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it juststruck him that Fitz nicknamed Skinthe merely drove the car for the      actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliablyinformed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the pleasome legal luminary saved his skin on In any case that was very ancienthistory by now and as for our friend the pseudo Skintheetcetera he hadtransparently outlived his welcome He ought to have either died naturallyor on the scaffold high Like actresses always farewell positively lastperformance then come up smiling again Generous to a fault of coursetemperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping atthe bone for the shadow So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion thatMr Johnny Lever got rid of some l s d in the course of his perambulations                              round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland taverncome back to Erin and so on Then as for the other he had heard not solong before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply buteffectually silenced the offenderHe took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on thewhole eventempered person declared I let slip He called me a jew and in aheated fashion offensively So I without deviating from plain facts in theleast told him his God I mean Christ was a jew too and all his family likeme though in reality Im not That was one for him A soft answer turnsaway wrath He hadnt a word to say for himself as everyone saw Am I notright He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous darkpride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemedto glean in a kind of a way that it wasnt all exactly Ex quibus Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or foureyes conversing Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any othersecundum carnemOf course Mr B proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides ofthe question It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right andwrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though everycountry they say our own distressful included has the government itdeserves But with a little goodwill all round Its all very fine to boast ofmutual superiority but what about mutual equality I resent violence andintolerance in any shape or form It never reaches anything or stopsanything A revolution must come on the due instalments plan Its a patentabsurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the cornerand speak another vernacular in the next house so to speakMemorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war Stephenassented between Skinners alley and Ormond marketYes Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed entirely endorsing the remark thatwas overwhelmingly right And the whole world was full of that sort ofthingYou just took the words out of my mouth he said A hocuspocus ofconflicting evidence that candidly you couldnt remotely All those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up badblood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kinderroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag werevery largely a question of the money question which was at the back ofeverything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stopThey accuse remarked he audiblyHe turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer toso as the others in case theyJews he softly imparted in an aside in Stephens ear are accused ofruining Not a vestige of truth in it I can safely say History would you besurprised to learn proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisitionhounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell anuncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer forimported them Why Because they are imbued with the proper spirit Theyare practical and are proved to be so I dont want to

compared with goahead America TurksIts in the dogma Because if they didnt believe theyd go straight to heavenwhen they die theyd try to live better at least so I think Thats thejuggle on which the pps raise the wind on false pretences Im he resumedwith dramatic force as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you aboutat the outset and I want to see everyone concluded he all creeds and classespro rata having a comfortable tidysized income in no niggard fashioneither something in the neighbourhood of  pounds per annum Thats thevital issue at stake and its feasible and would be provocative of friendlierintercourse between man and man At least thats my idea for what itsworth I call that patriotism Ubi patria as we learned a smattering of inour classical days in Alma Mater vita bene Where you can live well thesense is if you workOver his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to thissynopsis of things in general Stephen stared at nothing in particular Hecould hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabsabout Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours ofdifferent sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneathor seemed to Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didnt say thewords the voice he heard said if you workCount me out he managed to remark meaning workThe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the personwho owned them pro tem observed or rather his voice speaking did allmust work have to togetherI mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widestpossible sense Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thingWriting for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays Thatswork too Important work After all from the little I know of you after allthe money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourselfand command your price You have every bit as much right to live by yourpen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has What You bothbelong to Ireland the brain and the brawn Each is equally importantYou suspect Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Irelandfor shortI would go a step farther Mr Bloom insinuatedBut I suspect Stephen interrupted that Ireland must be importantbecause it belongs to meWhat belongs queried Mr Bloom bending fancying he was perhapsunder some misapprehension Excuse me Unfortunately I didnt catch thelatter portion What was it you Stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mugof coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding  We cant change the country Let us change the subjectAt this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom to change the subject lookeddown but in a quandary as he couldnt tell exactly what construction to puton belongs to which sounded rather a far cry The rebuke of some kind wasclearer than the other part Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgyspoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his soberstate Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importancehad not been all that was needful or he hadnt been familiarised with theright sort of people With a touch of fear for the young man beside himwhom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris the eyes more especiallyreminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light onthe subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows thatpromised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody toblame but themselves For instance there was the case of OCallaghan forone the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequatemeans with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rottoand making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habitof ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact And thenthe usual denouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after astrong hint to a

forth and so onAll the same Bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at theirmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and notsingly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it wastwenty odd years Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow oftruth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highlyinadvisable all things considered Something evidently riled them in hisdeath Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when hisvarious different political arrangements were nearing completion orwhether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to changehis boots and clothesafter a wetting when a cold resulted and failing toconsult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died ofit

direction ofthe  door and reflected upon the historic story which had arousedextraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse weremade public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them fullof sweet nothings First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened andan attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climaxand the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came asa welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who wereresolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was publicproperty

necessity toproclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that hehad shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when athrill went through the packed court

repeating itself with adifference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alonein his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to thegraveOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatantjokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and thewherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case forthe two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husbandhappened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usualboy Jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in aloving position locked in one anothers arms drawing attention to theirillicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fairone begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees andpromising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if onlythe aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones bebygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her faircheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others Hepersonally being of a sceptical bias believed and didnt make the smallestbones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were alwayshanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was thebest wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake ofargument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded lifeand was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentionson her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred onanother the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married womengetting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famouscases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hiltIt was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance ofbrains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time withprofligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him hislifetime In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take untohimself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladiessociety was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possibledoubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about MissFerguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought himdown to Irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would findmuch satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and thecompany of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweeklywith the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walkingout leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs To think of himhouse and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmotherwas really too bad at his age The queer suddenly things he popped out withattracted the elder man who was several years the others senior or like hisfather but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it onlyan eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that thehomely Humpty Dumpty boiledAt what oclock did you dine he questioned of the slim form and tiredthough unwrinkled faceSome time yesterday Stephen saidYesterday exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrowFriday Ah you mean its after twelveThe day before yesterday Stephen said improving on himselfLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflectedThough they didnt see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy theresomehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the onetrain of thought At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score ofyears previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentaryhonours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect whichwas a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard forthose same ultra ideas For instance when the evicted tenants question thenat its first inception bulked largely in peoples mind though it goeswithout saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely toits dictums some of which wouldnt exactly hold water he at the outset inprinciple at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession asvoicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realisinghis mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twittedwith going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at onetime inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he stronglyresented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friendat the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernans so that he though oftenconsiderably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be itrepeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphoricallyone in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned hewas only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting frompropaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and sufferingit entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chieflydestruction of the fittest in a wordAnyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as itwas it was high time to be retiring for the night The crux was it was a bitrisky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebodyhaving a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as onthe night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lamepaw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he hadhurt his hand too to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly rememberedhaving been there so to speak On the other hand it was altogether far andaway too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he wasin some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives Everything pointed tothe fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunityall things considered His initial impression was he was a shade standoffishor not over effusive but it grew on him someway For one thing he mightntwhat you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried himwas he didnt know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he didentertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure ifhe would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe iffound suitable At all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for thenonce hidebound precedent a cup of Eppss cocoa and a shakedown forthe night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow atleast he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failedto perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso norumpus of any sort was kicked up A move had to be made because thatmerry old soul the grasswidower in question who

seanceSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left theshelter or shanty together and the elite society of oilskin and companywhom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce farniente Stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged outpaused at the for a moment the doorOne thing I never understood he said to be original on the spur of themoment Why they put tables upside down at night I mean chairs upsidedown on the tables in cafesTo which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without amoments hesitation saying straight offTo sweep the floor in the morningSo saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the sametime apologetic to get on his companions right a habit of his by the byehis right side being in classical idiom his tender Achilles The night airwas certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak onhis pinsIt will the air do you good Bloom said meaning also the walk in amoment The only thing is to walk then youll feel a different man ComeIts not far Lean on meAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephens right and led him onaccordinglyYes Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a

all intents and purposeswrapped in the arms of Murphy as the adage has it dreaming of freshfields and pastures new And apropos of coffin of stones the analogy wasnot at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwoout of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split andchiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants hehad put in their holdingsSo they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for whichBloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracksarm in arm across Beresford place Wagnerian music though confessedlygrand in its way was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at thefirst gooff but the music of Mercadantes Huguenots Meyerbeers SevenLast Words on the Cross and Mozarts Twelfth Mass he simply revelled inthe Gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as suchliterally knocking everything else into a cocked hat He infinitely preferredthe sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop couldoffer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to liveand I will live thy protestant to be He also yielded to none in hisadmiration of Rossinis Stabat Mater a work simply abounding inimmortal numbers in which his wife Madam Marion Tweedy made a hit averitable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laureisand putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church inupper Gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hearher with virtuosos or virtuosi rather There was the unanimous opinionthat there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place ofworship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desirefor an encore On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of theDon Giovanni description and Martha a gem in its line he had a penchantthough with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school suchas Mendelssohn And talking of that taking it for granted he knew all aboutthe old favourites he mentioned par excellence Lionels air in MarthaMappari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be moreaccurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips ofStephens respected father sung to perfection a study of the number infact which made all the others take a back seat Stephen in reply to apolitely put query said he didnt sing it but launched out into praises ofShakespeares songs at least of in or about that period the lutenistDowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist who annosludendo hausi Doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasingfrom Mr Arnold Dolmetsch whom B did not quite recall though the namecertainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son withtheir dux and comes conceits and Byrd William who played the virginalshe said in the Queens chapel or anywhere else he found them and oneTomkins who made toys or airs and John BullOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speakingbeyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the pavenground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloomwas not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion tosixtyfive guineas and John Bull He inquired if it was John Bull the politicalcelebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as astriking coincidenceBy the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceivingBloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the otherssleeve gently jocosely remarkingOur lives are in peril tonight Beware of the steamrollerThey thereupon stopped Bloom looked at the head of a horse notworth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quitenear so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even fleshbecause palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker ataildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lordof his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts But such a goodpoor brute he was sorry he hadnt a lump of sugar but as he wiselyreflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that mightcrop up He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse withouta second care in the world But even a dog he reflected take that mongrelin Barney Kiernans of the same size would be a holy horror to face But itwas no animals fault in particular if he was built that way like the camelship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump Nine tenths ofthem all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barringthe bees Whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of hisback and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eyeThese timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mindsomewhat distracted from Stephens words while the ship of the street wasmanoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting oldWhats this I was saying Ah yes My wife he intimated plunging inmedias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making youracquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kindHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephenimage of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsomeblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after ashe was perhaps not that way builtStill supposing he had his fathers gift as he more than suspected itopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingalls Irish industriesconcert on the preceding Monday and aristocracy in generalExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here hasEnd by Jans Pieter Sweelinck a Dutchman of

ListigkeitTun die Poeten dichtenThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore Bloomnodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by allmeans which he didA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boonswhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily ifproperly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such asBarraclough

bestresidential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business andtitled people where with his university degree of B A a huge ad in its wayand gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence

to the better worm his way into their goodgraces as he a youthful tyro insocietys sartorial niceties hardlyunderstood how a little thing like that could militate against you It was infact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participatingin their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of theChristmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of thefair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of whichas he happened to know were on recordin fact without giving the showaway he himself once upon a time if he

lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyricplatform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time But a step in therequired direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily andmentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and itoften turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneededmoment when every little helped Besides though taste latterly haddeteriorated to a degree original music like that different from theconventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decidednovelty for Dublins musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchytenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and HiltonSt Just and their genus omne Yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he couldwith all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a namefor himself and win a high place in the citys esteem where he couldcommand a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for thepatrons of the King street house given a backerup if one were forthcomingto kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some impetus of thegoahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often trippedup a too much feted prince of good fellows And it need not detract fromthe other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of timeto practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doingwithout its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatorywhatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone In fact he had the ball athis feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of aremarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at allThe horse was just then And later on at a propitious opportunity hepurposed Bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on thefools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connectionwith a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparageand even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not presentdeprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in Blooms humbleopinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a persons character no punintendedThe horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak haltedand rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall onthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smokingglobes of turds Slowly three times one after another from a full crupper hemired And humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient inhis scythed carSide by side Bloom

problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutuallyselfexcluding propositionsThe irreparability of the past once at a performance of Albert Henglerscircus in the Rotunda Rutland square Dublin an intuitive particolouredclown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in theauditorium where Bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared toan exhilarated audience that he Bloom was his the clowns papa Theimprevidibility of the future once in the summer of  he Bloom hadmarked a florin  with three notches on the milled edge and tendered itm payment of an account due to

returnedNeverWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress himBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amendmany social conditions the product of inequality and avarice andinternational animosityHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating theseconditionsThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct fromhuman

epicentres of which are located in denselypopulated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions ofmetamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decayWhy did he desist from speculationBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other moreacceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to beremovedDid Stephen participate in his dejectionHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceedingsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rationalreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon

againdivisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends anddivisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progresswere carried far enough nought nowhere was never reachedWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise resultBecause some years previously in  when occupied with the problem ofthe quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a numbercomputed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of somany places eg the th power of the th power of  that the resulthaving been obtained  closely printed

whenelevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere sufferedwith arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line ofdemarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximatedfrom nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposingthis problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesiswhich could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differentlyanatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise underMartian Mercurial Veneral Jovian Saturnian Neptunian or Uraniansufficient and equivalent conditions though

not a heavenbeast not aheavenman That it was a Utopia there being no known method from theknown to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by thesuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and ofdifferent magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in spaceremobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a presentbefore its probable spectators had entered actual present existenceWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacleIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in thedelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejectioninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satelliteof their planetDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of

City Arms hotel when heused to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness tomake himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought hehad a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herselfand her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out d for hermethylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat inher about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bitof fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down onbathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them Isuppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Illnever be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she wasa welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan hereand Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dogsmelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especiallythen still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters andbeggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he gotanything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to gointo a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring itinto him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing onthe carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybelike the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes becausetheyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get wellif his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one offthe south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at thesugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing himflowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basketanything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice tryingto imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face againthough he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bedfather was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut histoe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if itwas a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course thewoman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhereIm sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking ofher so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he wasreally and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning itHynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton andwho else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not longmarried flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my backon him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he hadthe impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almightyand his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called asolicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not thatits some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on thesly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterdayhe was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to showhim Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered itup with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so veryprobably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him becauseall men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he isnow so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool andthen the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two strawsnow who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find outso long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like thatslut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom toexcite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him onceor twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found thelong hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchenpretending he was drinking water  woman is not enough for them it wasall his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat atour table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my housestealing my potatoes and the oysters  per doz going out to see her aunt ifyou please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something onwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have noproof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I toldher what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her Iwouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room theFriday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her faceswelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw tothat better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker onlyfor the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhoweither she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought hewas with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to myface and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she wastoo well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so hemust do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was itthe night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka inmy hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with mythumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming lovebecause he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Imdining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him thesatisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be alwaysand ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to doit since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a littlealone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and makehim turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with thatdown on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hourquestion and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalmanyes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishopwas sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting thatwoollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about themonuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making himworse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking ofwho is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yesimagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of mewhat he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simplyruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it tillhe comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips paleanyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about itpeople make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it andthink no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going andmarrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way sonice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other wouldtake me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothinglike a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hatethat confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me fatherand what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool butwhereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yesrather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottomright out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did youwhatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the realfather what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God hehad a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neitherwould he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know mein the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turnor let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a womanof course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to beembraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like thepope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too carefulabout himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonderwas he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind goingaway so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass amI I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking ofme or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought hesmelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kindof paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip thoserichlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnniesdrink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of thatAmerican that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all hecould do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we tookthe port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovelyand tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I poppedstraight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thoughtthe heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myselfand said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if theworld was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no Godwhat could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only makean act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars streetchapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if heheard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul youhave no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is tohave one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come  or  timeswith that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein orwhatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is notso big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hoursdressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thickcrowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a fewdozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone hadone the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a wholesheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middleof us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they wantout of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut myeyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I madehim pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better incase any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it inme nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but ifsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I wentthrough with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and MinaPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with achild or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell ofchildren off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger witha shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was therea squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear yourears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out likeelephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not offhim though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but Idont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly Isuppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about meand Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do himany good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he wasdancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsonshousewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was onaccount of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had thestandup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lordbeing a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitiveabout everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for Iknew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyedme so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedupthings especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study upthat myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could alwayshear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after thatI pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be abit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I saidover to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and thethree pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him tomake it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her againand was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat theonions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouseor touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I kiss then would sendthem all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she ofcourse would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with himthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love himand look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine hewas and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner likehe did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though Iliked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for theasking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I wasrolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I puthim off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pastyflour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so Ididnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to bealways embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of courseglauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possibleasking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on tothat putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking abit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kindhe is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was veryhandsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked thoughhe was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engagedafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughingwith the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one afteranother with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she saidyes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used totell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough tomake her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the doormuch after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after livingwith that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawnand run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a rowwith him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down aconversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down whatwas it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with hismuddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get intobed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a manwell its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he doesalways wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and alwaysblacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes upin the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for pounds for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like thatsimply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his bootsoff now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die  times overthan marry another of their sex of course hed never find another womanlike me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yesand he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrickthat poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other manyes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do athing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive youmad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marrythem for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get onwithout us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonderwhy they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us aswise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the otherfellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was hernature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang awoman surely are theytheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot henoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B Cwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we bothordered  teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his twoold maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was whatdo I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he mademe buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself alwayswith some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot mysuede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of awoman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladieslavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I sawhis eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was lookingwhen I looked back and I went there for tea  days after in the hope but hewasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when wewere in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk inmy hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month anice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my footso much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwinsbotchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in thehouse to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off mystockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time itwas my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could findbut of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did hesay I could give  points in  to Katty Lanner and beat her what does thatmean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition justpassed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite Ithink I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting thebutter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of whenhe commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods AveMaria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow andpart which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too mylow notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the wayhe used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in aplace like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him aboutthat some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show himthe very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinksnothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about mymother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as hedid he was lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bitcut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth squarehe kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking mequestions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let himkeep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into hispocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seenalways skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirtsblowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at theopen air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun sohe could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind followingin the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner ofthe Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in theZingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat lookingslyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they cango and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it andwere not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you whereare you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes onmy neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting toowarm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes tillI took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves weretoo cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear medrawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pairoff my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he didlook a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made mehungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat Ihad on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneeldown in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his newraincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre sosavage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched histrousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keephim from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out washe circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everythingtoo quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all thetime for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and hadto go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all thosewords in it how could he have the face to any woman after his companymanners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have Ioffended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a fewbrains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking ortearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knewwhat it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand youI said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up witha picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt findanywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morninga letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knewthe way to take a woman when he sent me the  big poppies because minewas the th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn Icouldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but henever knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Mondayas he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answerthe door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you allundressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day oldfrostyface Goodwin called

about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife hewent no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince ofWales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some ofthose books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebodysupposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because herbumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her ae as if anyfool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things withthat old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and thatRuby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I cameto page  o the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cordflagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made upabout he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was overlike the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins armssure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought firstit came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when shewanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was inGibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where heplanted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have plantedme too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought tochuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and gointo an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where theycould put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course heprefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whatsyour programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisementswhen he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did thensending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to bethe manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff asthe mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with theold rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in itbut theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knewit was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd andBums as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale alot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills mealtogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress andcooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I wentby his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take thatthats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he saidsuited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins andneedles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had themisfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be withher smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shesthere for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonderbut he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like thesoup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up toopen the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Imextremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked thefirst time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife Ijust half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he saidIm extremely sorry and Im sure you wereyes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long hemade me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiffthe nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill takethose eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are allthose veins and things curious the way its made  the same in case of twinstheyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in themuseum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they sobeautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bagsfull and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you likea hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgustingCameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with thered head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I waspassing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with hisbabyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well theSurreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every timenearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt streetstation just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was Iof the  wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places thenight coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges andlemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into r of them it was sobiting cold I couldnt keep it when was that  the canal was frozen yes itwas a few months after a

job in Helys and I was sellingthe clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath ofthe nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like thatdirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about likethat I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in itand he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never canexplain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes andburns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so muchtheres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had toscream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milkwith Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could havegot a pound a week as a wet

Ulyssesby James JoyceThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy for Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst and all other Arlingtoniansfor tea sympathy and a sofaFar out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable  end  ofthe  western  spiral  arm  of  the Galaxy lies a small unregardedyellow sunOrbiting this at a distance of roughly ninetytwo  million  milesis  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose apedescended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  stillthink digital watches are a pretty neat ideaThis planet has  or rather had  a problem which was this mostof  the  people  on  it were unhappy for pretty much of the timeMany solutions were suggested for this problem but most of thesewere  largely  concerned with the movements of small green piecesof paper which is odd because on the whole it wasnt  the  smallgreen pieces of paper that were unhappyAnd so the problem remained lots of the people  were  mean  andmost of them were miserable even the ones with digital watchesMany were increasingly of the opinion that theyd all made a  bigmistake  in  coming  down  from the trees in the first place Andsome said that even the trees had been a bad move  and  that  noone should ever have left the oceansAnd then one Thursday nearly two thousand years after  one  manhad  been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to benice to people for a change one girl sitting on  her  own  in  asmall  cafe  in  Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was thathad been going wrong all this time and she finally knew how  theworld  could  be  made  a  good and happy place This time it wasright it would work and no one would  have  to  get  nailed  toanythingSadly however before she could get to a phone  to  tell  anyoneabout  it  a  terribly stupid catastrophe occurred and the ideawas lost foreverThis is not her storyBut it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and  someof its consequencesIt is also the story of a book a book called The  Hitch  HikersGuide  to  the  Galaxy    not  an Earth book never published onEarth and until the terrible catastrophe occurred never seen orheard of by any EarthmanNevertheless a wholly remarkable bookin fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come outof  the  great  publishing  houses  of  Ursa  Minor  of which noEarthman had ever heard eitherNot only is it a wholly remarkable book  it  is  also  a  highlysuccessful  one    more  popular  than  the  Celestial Home CareOmnibus better selling than Fifty More  Things  to  do  in  ZeroGravity and more controversial than Oolon Colluphids trilogy ofphilosophical blockbusters Where God Went  Wrong  Some  More  ofGods Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person AnywayIn many of the more relaxed civilizations on  the  Outer  EasternRim of the Galaxy the Hitch Hikers Guide has already supplantedthe great Encyclopedia Galactica as the  standard  repository  ofall  knowledge  and  wisdom for though it has many omissions andcontains much that is apocryphal or at least wildly  inaccurateit  scores  over the older more pedestrian work in two importantrespectsFirst it is slightly cheaper and  secondly  it  has  the  wordsDont Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its coverBut the story of this terrible stupid Thursday the story of itsextraordinary   consequences   and   the  story   of  how  theseconsequences are inextricably intertwined  with  this  remarkablebook begins very simplyIt begins with a houseThe house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the villageIt  stood  on  its  own  and  looked  over a broad spread of WestCountry farmland Not a remarkable house by any means    it  wasabout  thirty  years old squattish squarish made of brick andhad four windows set in the front of a size and proportion  whichmore or less exactly failed to please the eyeThe only person for whom the house was in  any  way  special  wasArthur  Dent and that was only because it happened to be the onehe lived in He had lived in it for about three years ever sincehe  had  moved  out  of  London  because  it made him nervous andirritable He was about thirty as well  dark  haired  and  neverquite at ease with himself The thing that used to worry him mostwas the fact that people always used  to  ask  him  what  he  waslooking  so  worried  about  He  worked  in local radio which healways used to tell his friends was a lot more  interesting  thanthey  probably  thought It was too  most of his friends workedin advertisingIt hadnt properly registered with Arthur that the council wantedto knock down his house and build an bypass insteadAt eight oclock on Thursday  morning  Arthur  didnt  feel  verygood  He  woke  up blearily got up wandered blearily round hisroom opened a window saw a bulldozer found his  slippers  andstomped off to the bathroom to washToothpaste on the brush  so ScrubShaving mirror  pointing at the ceiling He adjusted it  For  amoment  it  reflected  a  second  bulldozer  through the bathroomwindow Properly adjusted it reflected Arthur  Dents  bristlesHe shaved them off washed dried and stomped off to the kitchento find something pleasant to put in his mouthKettle plug fridge milk coffee YawnThe word bulldozer wandered through his  mind  for  a  moment  insearch of something to connect withThe bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big oneHe stared at itYellow he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom  to  getdressedPassing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of  waterand  another  He began to suspect that he was hung over Why washe hung over Had he been drinking the night before He  supposedthat  he must have been He caught a glint in the shaving mirrorYellow he thought and stomped on to the bedroomHe stood and thought The pub he thought Oh dear the  pub  Hevaguely remembered being angry angry about something that seemedimportant Hed been telling  people  about  it  telling  peopleabout  it  at  great  length  he  rather suspected his clearestvisual recollection was of glazed looks on other peoples  facesSomething  about a new bypass he had just found out about It hadbeen in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have  knownabout  it  Ridiculous  He  took  a swig of water It would sortitself out hed decided no one wanted  a  bypass  the  councildidnt have a leg to stand on It would sort itself outGod what a terrible hangover it had earned him though He  lookedat  himself  in  the  wardrobe  mirror  He stuck out his tongueYellow he thought The word yellow wandered through  his  mindin search of something to connect withFifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in  frontof a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden pathMr L Prosser was as they say only human In other words he  wasa carbonbased life form descended from an ape More specificallyhe was forty fat and shabby and worked for  the  local  councilCuriously  enough though he didnt know it he was also a directmaleline  descendant  of  Genghis   Khan   though   interveninggenerations  and  racial  mixing had so juggled his genes that hehad  no  discernible  Mongoloid  characteristics  and  the  onlyvestiges  left  in  Mr  L  Prosser  of his mighty ancestry were apronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for  littlefur hatsHe was by no means a great warrior in  fact  he  was  a  nervousworried  man  Today  he  was  particularly  nervous  and worriedbecause something had gone seriously wrong with his job    whichwas  to  see  that Arthur Dents house got cleared out of the waybefore the day was outCome off it Mr Dent he said you cant win  you  know  Youcant  lie  in  front of the bulldozer indefinitely He tried tomake his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldnt do itArthur lay in the mud and squelched at himIm game he said well see who rusts firstIm afraid youre going to have to accept it said  Mr  Prossergripping  his  fur  hat and rolling it round the top of his headthis bypass has got to be built and its going to be builtFirst Ive heard of it said Arthur  whys  it  going  to  bebuiltMr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit  then  stopped  andput it away againWhat do you mean whys it got to be built he  said  Its  abypass Youve got to build bypassesBypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from  pointA  to  point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B topoint A very fast People  living  at  point  C  being  a  pointdirectly  in  between  are often given to wonder whats so greatabout point A that so many people of point B are so keen  to  getthere  and  whats so great about point B that so many people ofpoint A are so keen to get there They  often  wish  that  peoplewould  just  once and for all work out where the hell they wantedto beMr Prosser wanted to be at point D Point D  wasnt  anywhere  inparticular it was just any convenient point a very long way frompoints A B and C He would have a nice little cottage  at  pointD  with  axes over the door and spend a pleasant amount of timeat point E which would be the nearest pub to point D  His  wifeof  course  wanted  climbing roses but he wanted axes He didntknow why  he  just  liked  axes  He  flushed  hotly  under  thederisive grins of the bulldozer driversHe shifted his weight from foot  to  foot  but  it  was  equallyuncomfortable  on  each  Obviously somebody had been appallinglyincompetent and he hoped to God it wasnt himMr Prosser said You were quite entitled to make any suggestionsor protests at the appropriate time you knowAppropriate time hooted Arthur Appropriate time The first Iknew  about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday Iasked him if hed come to clean the windows and he said  no  hedcome  to  demolish  the house He didnt tell me straight away ofcourse Oh no First he wiped a couple of windows and charged  mea fiver Then he told meBut Mr Dent the plans have been available in the local planningoffice for the last nine monthOh yes well as soon as I heard I went  straight  round  to  seethem  yesterday  afternoon  You hadnt exactly gone out of yourway to call attention to them  had  you  I  mean  like  actuallytelling anybody or anythingBut the plans were on display On display I eventually had to go down to the  cellar  to  findthemThats the display departmentWith a torchAh well the lights had probably goneSo had the stairsBut look you found the notice didnt youYes said Arthur yes I did It was on display in  the  bottomof  a  locked  filing  cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with asign on the door saying Beware of the LeopardA cloud passed overhead It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as  helay  propped  up  on  his elbow in the cold mud It cast a shadowover Arthur Dents house Mr Prosser frowned at itIts not as if its a particularly nice house he saidIm sorry but I happen to like itYoull like the bypassOh shut up said Arthur Dent Shut up and go  away  and  takeyour  bloody  bypass  with you You havent got a leg to stand onand you know itMr Prossers mouth opened and closed a couple of times while  hismind  was  for  a  moment  filled  with inexplicable but terriblyattractive visions of Arthur Dents  house  being  consumed  withfire  and  Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruinwith at least three hefty spears protruding  from  his  back  MrProsser  was often bothered with visions like these and they madehim feel very nervous He stuttered for a moment and then  pulledhimself togetherMr Dent he saidHello Yes said ArthurSome factual information for you Have you  any  idea  how  muchdamage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straightover youHow much said ArthurNone at  all  said  Mr  Prosser  and  stormed  nervously  offwondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemenall shouting at himBy a curious  coincidence  None  at  all  is  exactly  how  muchsuspicion  the  apedescendant  Arthur  Dent  had that one of hisclosest friends was not descended from an ape but  was  in  factfrom  a  small  planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not fromGuildford as he usually claimedArthur Dent had never ever suspected thisThis friend of his had first arrived on the planet  some  fifteenEarth  years  previously and he had worked hard to blend himselfinto Earth society  with it must be  said  some  success  Forinstance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an outof work actor which was plausible enoughHe had made one careless blunder though because he had skimped abit  on his preparatory research The information he had gatheredhad led him to choose the name Ford  Prefect  as  being  nicelyinconspicuousHe was not conspicuously tall his features were striking but notconspicuously  handsome  His  hair  was  wiry  and gingerish andbrushed backwards from the temples His skin seemed to be  pulledbackwards  from  the  nose There was something very slightly oddabout him but it was difficult to say what it  was  Perhaps  itwas  that  his eyes didnt blink often enough and when you talkedto him for any length of time your eyes  began  involuntarily  towater  on  his behalf Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly toobroadly and gave people the  unnerving  impression  that  he  wasabout to go for their neckHe struck most of  the  friends  he  had  made  on  Earth  as  aneccentric  but  a  harmless  one    an unruly boozer with someoddish habits For instance he would often  gatecrash  universityparties   get   badly   drunk   and  start  making  fun  of  anyastrophysicist he could find till he got thrown outSometimes he would get seized with  oddly  distracted  moods  andstare  into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him whathe was doing Then he would start guiltily for  a  moment  relaxand grinOh just looking for flying saucers he would joke and everyonewould  laugh  and  ask  him  what  sort  of flying saucers he waslooking forGreen ones he would reply with a wicked grin laugh wildly fora  moment  and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy anenormous round of drinksEvenings like this usually ended badly Ford would get out of hisskull  on whisky huddle into a corner with some girl and explainto her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the  flyingsaucers didnt matter that much reallyThereafter staggering semiparalytic down the night  streets  hewould  often  ask  passing  policemen  if  they  knew  the way toBetelgeuse The  policemen  would  usually  say  something  likeDont you think its about time you went off home sirIm trying to baby Im trying  to  is  what  Ford  invariablyreplied on these occasionsIn fact what he  was  really  looking  out  for  when  he  stareddistractedly  into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer atall The reason he said green was that green was the  traditionalspace livery of the Betelgeuse trading scoutsFord Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer  at  all  wouldarrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get strandedanywhere particularly somewhere as  mindboggingly  dull  as  theEarthFord wished that a flying saucer would  arrive  soon  because  heknew  how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them Heknew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than  thirtyAltairan dollars a dayIn fact Ford Prefect was a roving  researcher  for  that  whollyremarkable book The Hitch Hikers Guide to the GalaxyHuman beings are great adaptors and by  lunchtime  life  in  theenvirons  of Arthurs house had settled into a steady routine Itwas Arthurs accepted role to lie squelching in  the  mud  makingoccasional  demands to see his lawyer his mother or a good bookit was Mr Prossers accepted  role  to  tackle  Arthur  with  theoccasional  new  ploy  such  as the For the Public Good talk theMarch of Progress talk the They Knocked My House Down  Once  YouKnow  Never  Looked  Back  talk and various other cajoleries andthreats and it was the bulldozer drivers accepted role  to  sitaround  drinking  coffee and experimenting with union regulationsto see how they could  turn  the  situation  to  their  financialadvantageThe Earth moved slowly in its diurnal courseThe sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay inA shadow moved across him againHello Arthur said the shadowArthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled  to  seeFord Prefect standing above himFord Hello how are youFine said Ford look are you busyAm I busy exclaimed Arthur Well Ive  just  got  all  thesebulldozers and things to lie in front of because theyll knock myhouse down if I dont but other  than  that    well  no  notespecially whyThey dont have sarcasm on Betelgeuse  and  Ford  Prefect  oftenfailed  to notice it unless he was concentrating He said Goodis there anywhere we can talkWhat said Arthur DentFor a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him and  stared  fixedlyinto  the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car Thensuddenly he squatted down beside ArthurWeve got to talk he said urgentlyFine said Arthur talkAnd drink said Ford Its vitally important that we talk  anddrink Now Well go to the pub in the villageHe looked into the sky again nervous expectantLook dont you  understand  shouted  Arthur  He  pointed  atProsser That man wants to knock my house downFord glanced at him puzzledWell he can do it while youre away cant he he askedBut I dont want him toAhLook whats the matter with you Ford said ArthurNothing Nothings the matter Listen to me  Ive got  to  tellyou  the most important thing youve ever heard Ive got to tellyou now and Ive got to tell you in the saloon bar of the  Horseand GroomBut whyBecause you are going to need a very stiff drinkFord stared at Arthur and Arthur was astonished to find that hiswill  was  beginning  to  weaken He didnt realize that this wasbecause of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in  thehyperspace  ports  that  served the madranite mining belts in thestar system of Orion BetaThe game was not unlike the Earth game called  Indian  Wrestlingand was played like thisTwo contestants would sit either side of a table with a glass infront of each of themBetween them  would  be  placed  a  bottle  of  Janx  Spirit  asimmortalized  in that ancient Orion mining song Oh dont give menone more of that Old Janx Spirit No dont  you  give  me  nonemore  of  that  Old  Janx Spirit For my head will fly my tonguewill lie my eyes will fry and I may die Wont you pour  me  onemore of that sinful Old Janx SpiritEach of the two contestants would then concentrate their will  onthe  bottle  and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glassof his opponent  who would then have to drink itThe bottle would then be  refilled  The  game  would  be  playedagain And againOnce you started to lose you would probably keep losing  becauseone  of  the  effects  of  Janx  spirit is to depress telepsychicpowerAs soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed the  finalloser  would  have  to  perform  a  forfeit  which  was  usuallyobscenely biologicalFord Prefect usually played to loseFord stared at Arthur who began to think  that  perhaps  he  didwant to go to the Horse and Groom after allBut what about my house  he asked plaintivelyFord looked across to Mr Prosser and suddenly a  wicked  thoughtstruck himHe wants to knock your house downYes he wants to build And he cant because youre lying in front of the bulldozersYes and Im sure we can come to some arrangement  said  Ford  Excuseme he shoutedMr Prosser who was arguing with a spokesman  for  the  bulldozerdrivers  about  whether  or  not Arthur Dent constituted a mentalhealth hazard and how much they  should  get  paid  if  he  didlooked around He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find thatArthur had companyYes Hello he called Has Mr Dent come to his senses yetCan we for the moment called Ford assume that he hasntWell sighed Mr ProsserAnd can we also assume said  Ford  that  hes  going  to  bestaying here all daySoSo all your men are going to be standing around  all  day  doingnothingCould be could be Well if  youre  resigned  to  doing  that  anyway  you  dontactually need him to lie here all the time do youWhatYou dont said Ford patiently actually need him hereMr Prosser thought about thisWell no not as  such  he  said  not  exactly  need  Prosser  was worried He thought that one of them wasnt making alot of senseFord said So if you would just like to take  it  as  read  thathes  actually here then he and I could slip off down to the pubfor half an hour How does that soundMr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly pottyThat sounds perfectly reasonable he said in a reassuring  toneof voice wondering who he was trying to reassureAnd if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself  later  onsaid Ford we can always cover up for you in returnThank you very much said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how  toplay  this  at  all  thank you very much yes thats very kind He frowned then smiled then tried  to  do  both  at  oncefailed  grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully roundthe top of his head He could only assume that he had just wonSo continued Ford Prefect if you would  just  like  to  comeover here and lie down What said Mr ProsserAh Im sorry said Ford perhaps I hadnt made  myself  fullyclear  Somebodys  got to lie in front of the bulldozers haventthey Or there wont be anything to stop  them  driving  into  MrDents house will thereWhat said Mr Prosser againIts very simple said Ford my client Mr Dent says that  hewill  stop  lying  here in the mud on the sole condition that youcome and take over from himWhat are you talking about said Arthur but  Ford  nudged  himwith his shoe to be quietYou want me said Mr Prosser spelling out this new thought  tohimself to come and lie there YesIn front of the bulldozerYesInstead of Mr DentYesIn the mudIn as you say it the mudAs soon as Mr Prosser realized  that  he  was  substantially  theloser  after  all  it  was  as if a weight lifted itself off hisshoulders this was more like the world as he knew it He sighedIn return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down  to  thepubThats it said Ford Thats it exactlyMr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stoppedPromisePromise said Ford He turned to ArthurCome on he said to him get up and let the man lie downArthur stood up feeling as if he was in a dreamFord beckoned to Prosser who sadly awkwardly sat  down  in  themud  He  felt  that his whole life was some kind of dream and hesometimes wondered whose it was and whether  they  were  enjoyingit The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozedinto his shoesFord looked at him severelyAnd no sneaky knocking down Mr Dents house  whilst  hes  awayalright he saidThe mere thought growled Mr Prosser  hadnt  even  begun  tospeculate  he  continued  settling  himself  back  about themerest possibility of crossing my mindHe saw the bulldozer drivers  union  representative  approachingand  let his head sink back and closed his eyes He was trying tomarshal his arguments for proving that he did not now  constitutea  mental  health  hazard  himself He was far from certain aboutthis  his mind seemed to be full of noise  horses  smoke  andthe  stench of blood This always happened when he felt miserableand put upon and he  had  never  been  able  to  explain  it  tohimself  In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mightyKhan bellowed with rage but Mr Prosser  only  trembled  slightlyand whimpered He began to fell little pricks of water behind theeyelids Bureaucratic cockups  angry  men  lying  in  the  mudindecipherable  strangers  handing  out inexplicable humiliationsand an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his  head what a dayWhat a day Ford Prefect knew that it didnt  matter  a  pair  ofdingos  kidneys  whether  Arthurs house got knocked down or notnowArthur remained very worriedBut can we trust him he saidMyself Id trust him to the end of the Earth said FordOh yes said Arthur and how fars thatAbout twelve minutes away  said  Ford  come  on  I  need  adrinkHeres what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about  alcoholIt  says  that  alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed bythe fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effecton certain carbonbased life formsThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy also mentions  alcohol  Itsays  that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic GargleBlasterIt says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is  likehaving  your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped rounda large gold brickThe Guide also tells you on which planets the best  Pan

Groom And quickly please the worlds about to endThe barman of the Horse and Groom didnt  deserve  this  sort  oftreatment  he  was a dignified old man He pushed his glasses uphis nose and blinked at Ford Prefect Ford ignored him and staredout  of  the  window  so the barman looked instead at Arthur whoshrugged helplessly and said nothingSo the barman said Oh  yes  sir  Nice  weather  for  it  andstarted pulling pintsHe tried againGoing to watch the match this afternoon thenFord glanced round at himNo no point he said and looked back out of the windowWhats that foregone conclusion then you reckon sir said  thebarman Arsenal without a chanceNo no said Ford its just that the worlds about to endOh yes sir so you said said  the  barman  looking  over  hisglasses  this  time  at  Arthur  Lucky escape for Arsenal if itdidFord looked back at him genuinely surprisedNo not really he said He frownedThe barman breathed in heavily There you are sir  six  pintshe saidArthur smiled at him wanly and  shrugged  again  He  turned  andsmiled  wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them hadheard what was going onNone of them had and none of them could understand what  he  wassmiling at them forA man sitting next to Ford at the bar  looked  at  the  two  menlooked  at the six pints did a swift burst of mental arithmeticarrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid  hopeful  grinat themGet off said Ford Theyre ours  giving  him  a  look  thatwould have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doingFord slapped a fivepound note on the bar  He  said  Keep  thechangeWhat from a fiver Thank you sirYouve got ten minutes left to spend itThe barman simply decided to walk away for a bitFord said Arthur would you please tell me what the  hell  isgoing onDrink up said Ford youve got three pints to get throughThree pints said Arthur At lunchtimeThe man next to ford grinned and  nodded  happily  Ford  ignoredhim He said Time is an illusion Lunchtime doubly soVery deep said  Arthur  you  should  send  that  in  to  theReaders Digest Theyve got a page for people like youDrink upWhy three pints all of a suddenMuscle relaxant youll need itMuscle relaxantMuscle relaxantArthur stared into his beerDid I do anything wrong today  he  said  or  has  the  worldalways  been  like this and Ive been too wrapped up in myself tonoticeAlright said Ford Ill try to  explain  How  long  have  weknown each otherHow long Arthur thought Er about five years maybe six hesaid Most of it seemed to make some sense at the timeAlright said Ford How would you react if I said that Im notfrom  Guildford  after  all but from a small planet somewhere inthe vicinity of BetelgeuseArthur shrugged in a soso sort of wayI dont know he said taking a pull of beer  Why    do  youthink its the sort of thing youre likely to sayFord gave up It really wasnt worth  bothering  at  the  momentwhat with the world being about to end He just saidDrink upHe added perfectly factuallyThe worlds about to endArthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile  The  rest  ofthe  pub  frowned  at  him A man waved at him to stop smiling atthem and mind his own businessThis must be Thursday said Arthur musing to  himself  sinkinglow over his beer I never could get the hang of ThursdaysOn this particular Thursday something was moving quietly throughthe  ionosphere  many  miles  above  the  surface  of the planetseveral somethings in fact  several  dozen  huge  yellow  chunkyslablike  somethings  huge as office buildings silent as birdsThey soared with ease basking in electromagnetic rays  from  thestar Sol biding their time grouping preparingThe planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious  of  theirpresence  which  was just how they wanted it for the moment Thehuge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly  they  passedover  Cape  Canaveral  without  a  blip Woomera and Jodrell Banklooked straight through them  which was a pity  because  it  wasexactly  the  sort  of  thing  theyd  been looking for all theseyearsThe only place they registered at all was on a small black devicecalled  a  SubEtha  SensOMatic  which  winked  away quietly toitself It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel whichFord Prefect wore habitually round his neck The contents of FordPrefects satchel were quite interesting in fact and  would  havemade any Earth physicists eyes pop out of his head which is whyhe always concealed them by keeping a couple of dogeared scriptsfor plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the topBesides the SubEtha SensOMatic  and  the  scripts  he  had  anElectronic  Thumb  a short squat black rod smooth and matt witha couple of flat switches and dials at one end  he  also  had  adevice  which looked rather like a largish electronic calculatorThis had about a hundred tiny flat press  buttons  and  a  screenabout  four  inches  square on which any one of a million pagescould be summoned  at  a  moments  notice  It  looked  insanelycomplicated and this was one of the reasons why the snug plasticcover it fitted into had the words Dont Panic printed on  it  inlarge friendly letters The other reason was that this device wasin fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of thegreat  publishing  corporations of Ursa Minor  The Hitch HikersGuide to the Galaxy The reason why it was published in the  formof  a  micro  sub  meson  electronic component is that if it wereprinted in normal book form an interstellar  hitch  hiker  wouldrequire several inconveniently large buildings to carry it aroundinBeneath that in Ford  Prefects  satchel  were  a  few  biros  anotepad and a largish bath towel from Marks and SpencerThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say  onthe subject of towelsA towel it says is about the most  massively  useful  thing  aninterstellar  hitch hiker can have Partly it has great practicalvalue  you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound acrossthe cold moons of Jaglan Beta you can lie on it on the brilliantmarblesanded beaches of Santraginus V inhaling  the  heady  seavapours  you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine soredly on the desert world of Kakrafoon use it  to  sail  a  miniraft  down  the slow heavy river Moth wet it for use in handtohandcombat wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes orto  avoid  the  gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal amindboggingly stupid animal it assumes that if you cant see itit  cant  see  you  daft as a bush but very ravenous you canwave your towel in emergencies  as  a  distress  signal  and  ofcourse  dry  yourself  off  with it if it still seems to be cleanenoughMore importantly a towel has immense  psychological  value  Forsome reason if a strag strag nonhitch hiker discovers that ahitch hiker has his towel with him he will automatically  assumethat  he  is  also  in  possession of a toothbrush face flannelsoap tin of biscuits flask compass map ball of string  gnatspray  wet  weather gear space suit etc etc Furthermore thestrag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of  these  or  adozen  other  items  that the hitch hiker might accidentally havelost What the strag will think is that any man who  can  hitchthe length and breadth of the galaxy rough it slum it struggleagainst terrible odds win through and  still  knows  where  histowel is is clearly a man to be reckoned withHence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking  slang  as  inHey  you  sass  that  hoopy  Ford  Prefect Theres a frood whoreally knows where his towel is Sass know be aware of meethave   sex  with  hoopy  really  together  guy  frood  reallyamazingly together guyNestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford  Prefects  satchelthe SubEtha SensOMatic began to wink more quickly Miles abovethe surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fanout  At  Jodrell  Bank  someone  decided it was time for a nicerelaxing cup of teaYou got a towel with you said Ford Prefect suddenly to ArthurArthur struggling through his third pint looked round at himWhy What no    should  I  have  He  had  given  up  beingsurprised there didnt seem to be any point any longerFord clicked his tongue in irritationDrink up he urgedAt that moment the dull sound of a rumbling  crash  from  outsidefiltered  through the low murmur of the pub through the sound ofthe jukebox through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccuppingover the whisky Ford had eventually bought himArthur choked on his beer leapt to his feetWhats that he yelpedDont worry said Ford they havent started yetThank God for that said Arthur and relaxedIts probably just your house being knocked  down  said  Forddrowning his last pintWhat shouted Arthur Suddenly Fords spell was broken  Arthurlooked wildly around him and ran to the windowMy God they are Theyre knocking my house down What  the  hellam I doing in the pub FordIt hardly makes any difference at this stage said  Ford  letthem have their funFun yelped Arthur Fun He quickly checked out of the windowagain that they were talking about the same thingDamn their fun he hooted and ran  out  of  the  pub  furiouslywaving  a  nearly  empty beer glass He made no friends at all inthe pub that lunchtimeStop you vandals You home wreckers bawled Arthur You  halfcrazed Visigoths stop will youFord would have to go after him Turning quickly to the barman heasked for four packets of peanutsThere you are sir said the barman slapping the packets on thebar twentyeight pence if youd be so kindFord was very kind  he gave the barman another  fivepound  noteand told him to keep the change The barman looked at it and thenlooked at Ford He suddenly shivered he experienced a  momentarysensation  that  he didnt understand because no one on Earth hadever experienced it before In moments  of  great  stress  everylife  form  that  exists  gives  out a tiny sublimal signal Thissignal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense  ofhow far that being is from the place of his birth On Earth it isnever possible to be further than  sixteen  thousand  miles  fromyour birthplace which really isnt very far so such signals aretoo minute to be noticed Ford Prefect was at this  moment  undergreat  stress  and  he was born  light years away in the nearvicinity of BetelgeuseThe  barman  reeled  for   a   moment   hit   by   a   shockingincomprehensible sense of distance He didnt know what it meantbut he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect almostaweAre you serious sir he said in a small whisper which had  theeffect  of  silencing  the  pub  You think the worlds going toendYes said FordBut this afternoonFord had recovered himself He was at his flippestYes  he  said  gaily  in  less  than  two  minutes  I  wouldestimateThe barman couldnt believe the conversation he was  having  buthe couldnt believe the sensation he had just had eitherIsnt there anything we can do about it then he saidNo nothing said Ford stuffing the peanuts into his pocketsSomeone in the hushed  bar  suddenly  laughed  raucously  at  howstupid everyone had becomeThe man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now  His  eyeswaved their way up to FordI thought he said that if the world was going to end we weremeant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or somethingIf you like yes said FordThats what they told us in the army said  the  man  and  hiseyes began the long trek back down to his whiskyWill that help asked the barmanNo said Ford and gave him a friendly smile  Excuse  me  hesaid Ive got to go With a wave he leftThe pub was silent for a moment longer and then  embarrassinglyenough  the man with the raucous laugh did it again The girl hehad dragged along to the pub with him had  grown  to  loathe  himdearly  over the last hour or so and it would probably have beena great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and  a  halfor so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen ozoneand carbon monoxide However when the moment came she  would  betoo busy evaporating herself to notice itThe barman cleared his throat He heard himself sayLast orders pleaseThe huge yellow machines began  to  sink  downward  and  to  movefasterFord knew they were there This wasnt the way he had wanted itRunning up the lane Arthur had  nearly  reached  his  house  Hedidnt  notice  how cold it had suddenly become he didnt noticethe wind he didnt notice the sudden irrational squall of  rainHe didnt notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawlingover the rubble that had been his homeYou barbarians he yelled Ill  sue  the  council  for  everypenny  its  got  Ill  have  you hung drawn and quartered Andwhipped And boiled  until   until    until  youve  hadenoughFord was running after him very fast Very very fastAnd then Ill do  it  again  yelled  Arthur  And  when  Ivefinished  I  will  take  all  the little bits and I will jump onthemArthur  didnt  notice  that  the  men  were  running  from   thebulldozers   he  didnt  notice  that  Mr  Prosser  was  staringhectically into the sky What Mr Prosser  had  noticed  was  thathuge   yellow  somethings  were  screaming  through  the  cloudsImpossibly huge yellow somethingsAnd I will carry on  jumping  on  them  yelled  Arthur  stillrunning  until  I get blisters or I can think of anything evenmore unpleasant to do and then Arthur tripped and fell headlong rolled and landed flat on  hisback  At last he noticed that something was going on His fingershot upwardsWhat the hells that he shriekedWhatever it was raced across the  sky  in  monstrous  yellownesstore  the  sky apart with mindbuggering noise and leapt off intothe distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bangthat drove your ears six feet into your skullAnother one followed and did the same thing only louderIts difficult to say exactly what the people on the  surface  ofthe  planet  were doing now because they didnt really know whatthey were doing themselves None of it made  a  lot  of  sense  running  into  houses running out of houses howling noiselesslyat the noise All around the world  city  streets  exploded  withpeople cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them andthen rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys desertsand oceans seeming to flatten everything it hitOnly one man stood and  watched  the  sky  stood  with  terriblesadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears He knew exactlywhat was happening and had known ever since his SubEtha  SensOMatic  had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillarand woken him with a start It was what he  had  waited  for  allthese  years  but  when  he  had  deciphered  the signal patternsitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had  gripped  himand squeezed his heart Of all the races in all of the Galaxy whocould have come and said a big hello to planet Earth he thoughtdidnt it just have to be the VogonsStill he knew what he had to do  As  the  Vogon  craft  screamedthrough  the  air  high above him he opened his satchel He threwaway a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor  Dreamcoat  hethrew away a copy of Godspell He wouldnt need them where he wasgoing Everything was ready everything was preparedHe knew where his towel wasA sudden silence hit the Earth If anything it was worse than thenoise For a while nothing happenedThe great ships hung motionless in the air over every nation  onEarth  Motionless  they  hung huge heavy steady in the sky ablasphemy against nature Many people went straight into shock astheir  minds  tried  to  encompass what they were looking at Theships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks dontAnd still nothing happenedThen there was a slight whisper a  sudden  spacious  whisper  ofopen  ambient  sound  Every hi fi set in the world every radioevery television every cassette recorder  every  woofer  everytweeter  every  midrange  driver  in  the  world quietly turneditself onEvery tin can every dust bin every  window  every  car  everywine  glass  every  sheet  of rusty metal became activated as anacoustically perfect sounding boardBefore the Earth passed away it was going to be  treated  to  thevery  ultimate in sound reproduction the greatest public addresssystem ever built  But  there  was  no  concert  no  music  nofanfare just a simple messagePeople of Earth your attention please a voice  said  and  itwas   wonderful   Wonderful   perfect  quadrophonic  sound  withdistortion levels so low as to make a brave man weepThis is  Prostetnic  Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic  HyperspacePlanning  Council the voice continued As you will no doubt beaware the plans for development of the outlying regions  of  theGalaxy  require  the  building  of  a  hyperspatial express routethrough your star system and regrettably your planet is  one  ofthose  scheduled  for  demolition The process will take slightlyless that two of your Earth minutes Thank youThe PA died awayUncomprehending terror settled on the watching people  of  EarthThe  terror  moved  slowly through the gathered crowds as if theywere iron fillings on a sheet of board and a  magnet  was  movingbeneath  them Panic sprouted again desperate fleeing panic butthere was nowhere to flee toObserving this the Vogons turned on their PA again It saidTheres no point in acting  all  surprised  about  it  All  theplanning  charts  and  demolition  orders have been on display inyour local planning department on Alpha  Centauri  for  fifty  ofyour  Earth  years  so  youve  had  plenty of time to lodge anyformal complaint and its far too late to  start  making  a  fussabout it nowThe PA fell silent again and its  echo  drifted  off  across  theland The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power Onthe underside of each a hatchway opened an empty black spaceBy  this  time  somebody  somewhere  must  have  manned  a  radiotransmitter  located a wavelength and broadcasted a message backto the Vogon ships to plead on behalf of the planet Nobody everheard  what  they said they only heard the reply The PA slammedback into life again The voice was annoyed It saidWhat do you mean  youve  never  been  to  Alpha  Centauri  Forheavens  sake mankind its only four light years away you knowIm sorry but if you cant be bothered to take  an  interest  inlocal affairs thats your own lookoutEnergize the demolition beamsLight poured out into the hatchwaysI dont know said the  voice  on  the  PA  apathetic  bloodyplanet Ive no sympathy at all It cut offThere was a terrible ghastly silenceThere was a terrible ghastly noiseThere was a terrible ghastly silenceThe Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away  into  the  inky  starryvoidFar away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy  five  hundredthousand  light  years  from  the  star  Sol  Zaphod BeeblebroxPresident of the Imperial Galactic Government  sped  across  theseas  of  Damogran his ion drive delta boat winking and flashingin the Damogran sunDamogran the  hot  Damogran  the  remote  Damogran  the  almosttotally unheard ofDamogran secret home of the Heart of GoldThe boat sped on across the water It would be some  time  beforeit   reached   its   destination  because  Damogran  is  such  aninconveniently  arranged  planet  It  consists  of  nothing  butmiddling  to  large  desert  islands separated by very pretty butannoyingly wide stretches of oceanThe boat sped onBecause of  this  topological  awkwardness  Damogran  has  alwaysremained  a  deserted  planet  This is why the Imperial GalacticGovernment chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project  becauseit was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secretThe boat zipped and skipped across the  sea  the  sea  that  laybetween  the  main  islands of the only archipelago of any usefulsize on the whole planet Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his  way  fromthe  tiny  spaceport  on  Easter Island the name was an entirelymeaningless coincidence  in Galacticspeke  easter  means  smallflat  and  light  brown  to  the  Heart of Gold island which byanother meaningless coincidence was called FranceOne of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a  wholestring of pretty meaningless coincidencesBut it was not in any way a coincidence that today  the  day  ofculmination  of  the project the great day of unveiling the daythat the Heart  of  Gold  was  finally  to  be  introduced  to  amarvelling Galaxy was also a great day of culmination for ZaphodBeeblebrox It was for the sake of this day  that  he  had  firstdecided  to  run  for  the  Presidency a decision which had sentwaves of astonishment throughout the  Imperial  Galaxy    ZaphodBeeblebrox   President  Not  the  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  Not  thePresident Many had seen it as a clinching proof that  the  wholeof known creation had finally gone bananasZaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speedZaphod Beeblebrox  adventurer  exhippy  good  timer  crookquite  possibly  manic selfpublicist terribly bad at personalrelationships often thought to be completely out to lunchPresidentNo one had gone bananas not in that way at leastOnly six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle  onwhich  the  Galaxy  was  governed and they knew that once ZaphodBeeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it wasmore  or  less  a  fait  accompli  he  was  the ideal PresidencyfodderWhat they completely failed to  understand  was  why  Zaphod  wasdoing itHe banked sharply shooting a wild wall of water at the sunToday was the day today was the day when they would realize whatZaphod  had  been  up  to  Today  was  what  Zaphod BeeblebroxsPresidency was all  about  Today  was  also  his  two  hundredthbirthday but that was just another meaningless coincidenceAs he skipped his boat across the  seas  of  Damogran  he  smiledquietly  to  himself  about  what a wonderful exciting day it wasgoing to be He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across theseat back He steered with an extra arm hed recently fitted justbeneath his right one to help improve his skiboxingHey he cooed to himself youre a real cool boy you But hisnerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistleThe island of France was about  twenty  miles  long  five  milesacross  the  middle sandy and crescent shaped In fact it seemedto exist not so much as an island in its own right  as  simply  ameans  of  defining  the  sweep  and  curve  of  a huge bay Thisimpression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline ofthe  crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs From thetop of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five  miles  to  theopposite shoreOn top of the cliffs stood a reception committeeIt consisted in large part of the engineers and  researchers  whohad built the Heart of Gold  mostly humanoid but here and therewere a few reptiloid atomineers two or  three  green  slyphlikemaximegalacticans  an  octopoid  physucturalist  or  two  and  aHooloovoo a Hooloovoo is a superintelligent shade of the  colorblue  All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multicolored ceremonial lab coats the Hooloovoo had been  temporarilyrefracted into a free standing prism for the occasionThere was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through  all  ofthem  Together  and between them they had gone to and beyond thefurthest limits of physical laws  restructured  the  fundamentalfabric  of  matter  strained  twisted  and  broken  the laws ofpossibility and impossibility but still the greatest  excitementof  all  seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round hisneck An orange sash  was  what  the  President  of  the  Galaxytraditionally  wore It might not even have made much differenceto them if theyd known exactly how much power the  President  ofthe  Galaxy actually wielded none at all Only six people in theGalaxy knew that the job of the Galactic  President  was  not  towield power but to attract attention away from itZaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his jobThe  crowd  gasped  dazzled  by  sun  and  seemanship  as   thePresidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay Itflashed and shone as  it  came  skating  over  the  sea  in  wideskidding turnsIn fact it didnt need to touch the water at all because it  wassupported  on  a  hazy  cushion  of  ionized atoms  but just foreffect it was fitted with thin finblades which could  be  loweredinto  the  water  They  slashed sheets of water hissing into theair carved deep gashes into the sea  which  swayed  crazily  andsank  back foaming into the boats wake as it careered across thebayZaphod loved effect it was what he was best atHe twisted the wheel sharply the boat slewed  round  in  a  wildscything  skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightlyon the rocking wavesWithin seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned  atover  three  billion  people  The  three  billion people werentactually there but they watched his every  gesture  through  theeyes  of a small robot triD camera which hovered obsequiously inthe air nearby The antics of the President always made amazinglypopular triD thats what they were forHe grinned again Three billion and six people  didnt  know  itbut today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained forThe robot camera homed in for a close up on the more  popular  ofhis  two  heads  and  he  waved again He was roughly humanoid inappearance except for the extra head  and  third  arm  His  fairtousled  hair  stuck  out  in  random  directions  his blue eyesglinted with something completely unidentifiable and  his  chinswere almost always unshavenA twentyfoothigh transparent globe floated next  to  his  boatrolling  and  bobbing glistening in the brilliant sun Inside itfloated a wide semicircular sofa  upholstered  in  glorious  redleather  the more the globe bobbed and rolled the more the sofastayed perfectly still steady as an upholstered rock Again alldone for effect as much as anythingZaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed  on  thesofa  He  spread his two arms lazily along the back and with thethird brushed some dust off his knee  His  heads  looked  aboutsmiling  he put his feet up At any moment he thought he mightscreamWater boiled up beneath the bubble it seethed and  spouted  Thebubble  surged  into  the  air  bobbing and rolling on the waterspout Up up it climbed throwing stilts of light at the  cliffUp  it  surged  on  the  jet  the water falling from beneath itcrashing back into the sea hundreds of feet belowZaphod smiled picturing himselfA thoroughly ridiculous  form  of  transport  but  a  thoroughlybeautiful oneAt the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment tipped onto  a railed ramp rolled down it to a small concave platform andriddled to a haltTo tremendous applause  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  stepped  out  of  thebubble his orange sash blazing in the lightThe President of the Galaxy had arrivedHe waited for the applause to die down then raised his hands  ingreetingHi he saidA government spider sidled up to him and  attempted  to  press  acopy  of his prepared speech into his hands Pages three to sevenof the original version were at the moment  floating  soggily  onthe  Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay Pages one andtwo had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle  and  hadalready  become  incorporated  into  an extraordinary new form ofnest which the eagle had invented It was constructed largely  ofpapier  mch and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatchedbaby eagle to break out of it The Damogran Frond  Crested  Eaglehad  heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted notruck with itZaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing  his  set  speech  and  hegently deflected the one being offered him by the spiderHi he said againEveryone beamed at him or at least nearly everyone He singledout  Trillian from the crowd Trillian was a gird that Zaphod hadpicked up recently  whilst  visiting  a  planet  just  for  funincognito  She  was  slim darkish humanoid with long waves ofblack hair a full mouth  an  odd  little  nob  of  a  nose  andridiculously  brown eyes With her red head scarf knotted in thatparticular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she  lookedvaguely  Arabic  Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arabof course The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist and  evenwhen they had existed they were five hundred thousand light yearsfrom Damogran Trillian  wasnt  anybody  in  particular  or  soZaphod  claimed  She  just went around with him rather a lot andtold him what she thought of himHi honey he said to herShe flashed him a quick tight smile and  looked  away  Then  shelooked  back  for  a  moment and smiled more warmly  but by thistime he was looking at something elseHi he said to a small knot of creatures  from  the  press  whowere standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and geton with the quotes He grinned at them  particularly  because  heknew  that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of aquoteThe next thing he said though was not a lot of use to  them  Oneof  the  officials  of  the  party had irritably decided that thePresident was clearly not in  a  mood  to  read  the  deliciouslyturned  speech that had been written for him and had flipped theswitch on the remote control device in his pocket Away in  frontof  them  a  huge  white dome that bulged against the sky crackeddown in the middle split and slowly folded itself down into theground Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well itwas going to do that because they had built it that wayBeneath it lay uncovered a huge starship one hundred  and  fiftymetres  long  shaped  like a sleek running shoe perfectly whiteand mindboggingly beautiful At the heart of it  unseen  lay  asmall  gold  box which carried within it the most brainwretchingdevice ever conceived a device which made this  starship  uniquein  the  history of the galaxy a device after which the ship hadbeen named  The Heart of GoldWow said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold There  wasntmuch else he could sayHe said it again because he knew it would annoy the pressWowThe crowd turned their faces back  towards  him  expectantly  Hewinked  at  Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyesat him She knew what he was about  to  say  and  thought  him  aterrible showoffThat is really amazing he said That really is truly amazingThat is so amazingly amazing I think Id like to steal itA marvellous Presidential quote absolutely  true  to  form  Thecrowd  laughed  appreciatively  the  newsmen  gleefully  punchedbuttons on their SubEtha NewsMatics and the President grinnedAs he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he  fingered  thesmall ParalysoMatic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocketFinally he could bear it no more He lifted his heads up  to  thesky  let out a wild whoop in major thirds threw the bomb to theground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smilesProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight even  for  otherVogons  His  highly  domed  nose  rose  high above a small piggyforehead His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him toplay  the game of Vogon Civil Service politics and play it welland waterproof enough for him  to  survive  indefinitely  at  seadepths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effectsNot that he ever went swimming of course His busy schedule wouldnot allow it He was the way he was because billions of years agowhen the Vogons had first crawled out of  the  sluggish  primevalseas  of  Vogsphere  and  had  lain  panting  and heaving on theplanets virgin shores when the first rays of the bright youngVogsol  sun  had shone across them that morning it was as if theforces of evolution ad simply given up on them  there  and  thenhad  turned  aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly andunfortunate mistake They never evolved again they should  neverhave survivedThe fact that they did is some kind  of  tribute  to  the  thickwilled  slugbrained  stubbornness of these creatures Evolutionthey said to themselves Who needs it and what  nature  refusedto  do  for  them they simply did without until such time as theywere able to rectify the grosser anatomical  inconveniences  withsurgeryMeanwhile the natural forces on the planet  Vogsphere  had  beenworking  overtime  to  make  up  for  their earlier blunder Theybrought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs  which  theVogons  ate  smashing  their  shells  with  iron  mallets  tallaspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which theVogons  cut  down and burned the crab meat with elegant gazellelike creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which  the  Vogonswould  catch  and  sit  on They were no use as transport becausetheir backs would snap instantly but  the  Vogons  sat  on  themanywayThus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia untilthe  Vogons  suddenly  discovered  the principles of interstellartravel Within a  few  short  Vog  years  every  last  Vogon  hadmigrated  to  the  Megabrantis  cluster the political hub of theGalaxy and now formed the  immensely  powerful  backbone  of  theGalactic  Civil Service They have attempted to acquire learningthey have attempted to acquire style and  social  grace  but  inmost  respects  the  modern  Vogon  is  little different from hisprimitive forebears Every year they import twentyseven thousandscintillating  jewelled  scuttling crabs from their native planetand while away a happy drunken night smashing them to  bits  withiron malletsProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he  wasthoroughly vile Also he did not like hitch hikersSomewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines  ofProstetnic   Vogon   Jeltzs   flagship  a  small  match  flarednervously The owner of the match was not a Vogon  but  he  knewall  about  them  and  was right to be nervous His name was FordPrefectHe looked about the cabin but  could  see  very  little  strangemonstrous  shadows  loomed  and  leaped  with the tiny flickeringflame but all was quiet He breathed a silent thank you  to  theDentrassis  The  Dentrassis  are an unruly tribe of gourmands awild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons  had  recently  taken  toemploying  as  catering  staff  on their long haul fleets on thestrict understanding that  they  keep  themselves  very  much  tothemselvesThis suited the Dentrassis fine because they loved Vogon  moneywhich  is one of the hardest currencies in space but loathed theVogons themselves The only sort of Vogon a  Dentrassi  liked  tosee was an annoyed VogonIt was because of  this  tiny  piece  of  information  that  FordPrefect  was  not  now  a  whiff  of  hydrogen  ozone and carbonmonoxideHe heard a slight groan By the light of the match he saw a heavyshape  moving  slightly  on the floor Quickly he shook the matchout reached in his pocket found what he  was  looking  for  andtook it out He crouched on the floor The shape moved againFord Prefect said I bought some peanutsArthur Dent moved and groaned again muttering incoherentlyHere have some urged Ford  shaking  the  packet  again  ifyouve  never  been  through  a  matter  transference beam beforeyouve probably lost some salt and  protein  The  beer  you  hadshould have cushioned your system a bitWhhhrrrr said Arthur Dent He opened his eyesIts dark he saidYes said Ford Prefect its darkNo light said Arthur Dent Dark no lightOne of the things  Ford  Prefect  had  always  found  hardest  tounderstand  about  human  beings  was  their habit of continuallystating and repeating the obvious as in  Its  a  nice  day  orYoure  very  tall  or  Oh  dear  you seem to have fallen down athirtyfoot well are you alright At first  Ford  had  formed  atheory  to  account  for  this strange behaviour If human beingsdont keep  exercising  their  lips  he  thought  their  mouthsprobably   seize  up  After  a  few  months  consideration  andobservation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new  one  Ifthey  dont  keep  on  exercising  their  lips he thought theirbrains start working After a while he abandoned this one as wellas  being  obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked humanbeings after all but  he  always  remained  desperately  worriedabout the terrible number of things they didnt know aboutYes he agreed with Arthur no light  He  helped  Arthur  tosome peanuts How do you feel he askedLike a military academy said  Arthur  bits  of  me  keep  onpassing outFord stared at him blankly in the darknessIf I asked you where the hell  we  were  said  Arthur  weaklywould I regret itFord stood up Were safe he saidOh good said ArthurWere in a small galley  cabin  said  Ford  in  one  of  thespaceships of the Vogon Constructor FleetAh said Arthur this is obviously some strange usage  of  theword safe that I wasnt previously aware ofFord struck another match to help him search for a light  switchMonstrous  shadows  leaped  and loomed again Arthur struggled tohis feet and hugged himself apprehensively Hideous alien  shapesseemed  to  throng about him the air was thick with musty smellswhich sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves and alow irritating hum kept his brain from focusingHow did we get here he asked shivering slightlyWe hitched a lift said FordExcuse me said Arthur Are you trying to tell me that we juststuck  out  our  thumbs and some green bugeyed monster stuck hishead out and said Hi fellas hop right in I can take you as faras the Basingstoke roundaboutWell said Ford the Thumbs an electronic subetha signallingdevice  the roundabouts at Barnards Star six light years awaybut otherwise thats more or less rightAnd the bugeyed monsterIs green yesFine said Arthur when can I get homeYou cant said Ford Prefect and found the light switchShade your eyes  he said and turned it onEven Ford was surprisedGood grief said Arthur is this  really  the  interior  of  aflying saucerProstetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round thecontrol   bridge   He   always   felt  vaguely  irritable  afterdemolishing populated planets He wished that someone would  comeand tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at themand feel better He flopped as heavily as  he  could  on  to  hiscontrol  seat  in  the  hope  that  it  would  break and give himsomething to be  genuinely  angry  about  but  it  only  gave  acomplaining sort of creakGo away he shouted at a young  Vogon  guard  who  entered  thebridge  at  that  moment The guard vanished immediately feelingrather relieved He was glad it wouldnt now be him who deliveredthe  report  theyd  just  received  The  report was an officialrelease which said that a wonderful new form of  spaceship  drivewas  at  this moment being unveiled at a government research baseon Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial  expressroutes unnecessaryAnother door slid open but this time the  Vogon  captain  didntshout  because it was the door from the galley quarters where theDentrassis prepared his meals A meal would be most welcomeA huge furry creature bounded through the  door  with  his  lunchtray It was grinning like a maniacProstetnic Vogon  Jeltz  was  delighted  He  knew  that  when  aDentrassi  looked  that  pleased  with itself there was somethinggoing on somewhere on the ship  that  he  could  get  very  angryindeed aboutFord and Arthur stared about themWell what do you think said FordIts a bit squalid isnt itFord  frowned  at  the  grubby  mattress   unwashed   cups   andunidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around thecramped cabinWell this is a working ship you see said  Ford  These  arethe Dentrassi sleeping quartersI thought you said they were called Vogons or somethingYes said Ford the Vogons run the ship  the  Dentrassis  arethe cooks they let us on boardIm confused said ArthurHere have a look at this said Ford He sat down on one of themattresses  and rummaged about in his satchel Arthur prodded themattress nervously and then sat on it himself  in  fact  he  hadvery  little to be nervous about because all mattresses grown inthe swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed  anddried  before  being  put  to service Very few have ever come tolife againFord handed the book to ArthurWhat is it asked ArthurThe Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Its a sort of  electronicbook  It  tells  you everything you need to know about anythingThats its jobArthur turned it over nervously in his handsI like the cover he said Dont Panic Its the first helpfulor intelligible thing anybodys said to me all dayIll show you how it works said  Ford  He  snatched  it  fromArthur who was still holding it as if it was a twoweekdead larkand pulled it out of its coverYou press this button here you see  and  the  screen  lights  upgiving you the indexA screen about three inches by four lit up and characters beganto flicker across the surfaceYou want to know about Vogons so I enter  that  name  so  Hisfingers tapped some more keys And there we areThe words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared  in  green  across  thescreenFord pressed a large red button at the bottom of the  screen  andwords  began  to  undulate  across it At the same time the bookbegan to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voiceThis is what the book saidVogon Constructor Fleets Here is what to do if you want to  geta  lift  from  a  Vogon  forget  it  They  are  one of the mostunpleasant races in the Galaxy   not  actually  evil  but  badtempered bureaucratic officious and callous They wouldnt evenlift a finger to save their own grandmothers  from  the  RavenousBugblatter  Beast  of  Traal without orders signed in triplicatesent in sent back queried lost  found  subjected  to  publicinquiry lost again and finally buried in soft peat and recycledas firelightersThe best way to get a drink out of a  Vogon  is  to  stick  yourfinger  down  his  throat and the best way to irritate him is tofeed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of TraalOn no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at youArthur blinked at itWhat a strange book How did we get a lift thenThats the point its out of date now said Ford sliding  thebook  back  into its cover Im doing the field research for theNew Revised Edition and one of the things Ill have  to  includeis  a  bit  about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks whichgives us a rather useful little loopholeA pained expression crossed  Arthurs  face  But  who  are  theDentrassi he saidGreat guys said Ford Theyre the best  cooks  and  the  bestdrink  mixers and they dont give a wet slap about anything elseAnd theyll always help hitch hikers aboard partly because  theylike  the company but mostly because it annoys the Vogons Whichis exactly the sort of thing  you  need  to  know  if  youre  animpoverished  hitch  hiker  trying  to  see  the  marvels  of theUniverse for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day And  thatsmy job Fun isnt itArthur looked lostIts  amazing  he  said  and  frowned  at  one  of  the  othermattressesUnfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than  Iintended  said  Ford  I  came  for  a  week and got stuck forfifteen yearsBut how did you get there in the first place thenEasy I got a lift with a teaserA teaserYeahEr what is A teaser Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do Theycruise around looking for planets which havent made interstellarcontact yet and buzz themBuzz them Arthur began to feel that Ford was  enjoying  makinglife difficult for himYeah said Ford they buzz them They find some isolated  spotwith  very  few  people around then land right by some poor soulwhom no ones ever going to believe and then strut up and down infront  of  him  wearing  silly antennae on their heads and makingbeep beep noises Rather childish really Ford leant back on themattress  with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatinglypleased with himselfFord insisted Arthur I dont know  if  this  sounds  like  asilly question but what am I doing hereWell you know that said Ford I rescued you from the EarthAnd whats happened to the EarthAh Its been demolishedHas it said Arthur levellyYes It just boiled away into spaceLook said Arthur Im a bit upset about thatFord frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around hismindYes I can understand that he said at lastUnderstand that shouted Arthur Understand thatFord sprang upKeep looking at the book he hissed urgentlyWhatDont PanicIm not panickingYes you areAlright so Im panicking what else is there to doYou just come along with me and have a good time The Galaxys afun place Youll need to have this fish in your earI beg your pardon asked Arthur rather politely he thoughtFord was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly  had  asmall  yellow fish wriggling around in it Arthur blinked at himHe wished there was something simple and  recognizable  he  couldgrasp hold of He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassiunderwear the piles of Squornshellous  mattresses  and  the  manfrom  Betelgeuse  holding  up a small yellow fish and offering toput it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet  ofcorn flakes He couldnt and he didnt feel safeSuddenly a violent noise leapt at them from  no  source  that  hecould  identify  He  gasped in terror at what sounded like a mantrying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolvesShush said Ford Listen it might be importantIm  importantIts the Vogon captain making an announcement on the TannoyYou mean thats how the Vogons talkListenBut I cant speak VogonYou dont need to Just put that fish in your earFord with a lightning movement clapped  his  hand  to  Arthursear  and  he  had  the  sudden  sickening  sensation of the fishslithering deep into his aural  tract  Gasping  with  horror  hescrabbled  at  his ear for a second or so but then slowly turnedgoggleeyed with wonder He was experiencing the aural equivalentof  looking  at  a  picture  of  two  black silhouetted faces andsuddenly seeing it as a picture of a  white  candlestick  Or  oflooking  at  a  lot  of  coloured  dots on a piece of paper whichsuddenly resolve themselves into the figure  six  and  mean  thatyour  optician  is  going  to charge you a lot of money for a newpair of glassesHe was still listening to the howling gargles he knew that onlynow  it  had  taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforwardEnglishThis is what he heard Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle  howl  garglehowl  howl  gargle  gargle  howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrpuuuurgh should have a good time Message repeats  This  is  yourcaptain   speaking   so  stop  whatever  youre  doing  and  payattention First of all I see from our instruments that we have acouple of hitchhikers aboard Hello wherever you are I just wantto make it totally clear that you  are  not  at  all  welcome  Iworked  hard to get where I am today and I didnt become captainof a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxiservice  for  a load of degenerate freeloaders I have sent out asearch party and as soon that they find you I will put  you  offthe ship If youre very lucky I might read you some of my poetryfirstSecondly we are about to jump into hyperspace for  the  journeyto  Barnards  Star  On  arrival  we  will  stay  in  dock for aseventytwo hour refit and no ones to  leave  the  ship  duringthat time I repeat all planet leave is cancelled Ive just hadan unhappy love affair so I dont see why  anybody  else  shouldhave a good time Message endsThe noise stoppedArthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was  lying  curledup  in  a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round hishead He smiled weaklyCharming man he said I wish I had  a  daughter  so  I  couldforbid her to marry one You wouldnt need to said  Ford  Theyve  got  as  much  sexappeal  as  a  road accident No dont move he added as Arthurbegan to uncurl himself youd better be prepared for  the  jumpinto hyperspace Its unpleasantly like being drunkWhats so unpleasant about being drunkYou ask a glass of waterArthur thought about thisFord he saidYeahWhats this fish doing in my earIts translating for you Its a Babel fish Look it up  in  thebook if you likeHe tossed over The Hitch Hikers Guide to  the  Galaxy  and  thencurled  himself  up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for thejumpAt that moment the bottom fell out of Arthurs mindHis eyes turned inside out His feet began to leak out of the topof his headThe room folded flat about  him  spun  around  shifted  out  ofexistence and left him sliding into his own navelThey were passing through hyperspaceThe Babel fish said The Hitch  Hikers  Guide  to  the  Galaxyquietly  is  small  yellow  and  leechlike  and probably theoddest thing in the Universe It feeds on  brainwave  energy  notfrom  its  carrier  but  from  those  around  it  It absorbs allunconscious mental frequencies  from  this  brainwave  energy  tonourish  itself  with  It  then  excretes  into  the mind of itscarrier a telepathic matrix formed  by  combining  the  consciousthought  frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speechcentres of the brain  which  has  supplied  them  The  practicalupshot  of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your earyou can instantly understand anything said to you in any form  oflanguage  The  speech  patterns  you  actually  hear  decode thebrainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your  BabelfishNow it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that  anythingso  mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance thatsome thinkers have chosen to see it as the  final  and  clinchingproof of the nonexistence of GodThe argument goes something like this I refuse to prove that Iexist says God for proof denies faith and without faith I amnothingBut says Man The Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isnt  itIt  could not have evolved by chance It proves you exist and sotherefore by your own arguments you dont QEDOh dear says God I hadnt thought of  that  and  promptlyvanished in a puff of logicOh that was easy says Man and for  an  encore  goes  on  toprove  that  black  is  white and gets himself killed on the nextzebra crossingMost leading theologians claim that this argument is a  load  ofdingos  kidneys  but  that didnt stop Oolon Colluphid making asmall fortune when he used it as the central theme of  his  bestselling book Well That About Wraps It Up For GodMeanwhile the poor Babel  fish  by  effectively  removing  allbarriers  to  communication between different races and cultureshas caused more and bloddier  wars  than  anything  else  in  thehistory of creationArthur let out a low groan He was horrified to discover that thekick  through  hyperspace hadnt killed him He was now six lightyears from the place that the Earth would have been if  it  stillexistedThe EarthVisions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind  Therewas  no  way  his  imagination could feel the impact of the wholeEarth having gone it was too big He  prodded  his  feelings  bythinking  that  his parents and his sister had gone No reactionHe thought of all the people he had been close to  No  reactionThen  he  thought  of  a  complete  stranger he had been standingbehind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt  a  suddenstab    the  supermarket  was  gone  everything in it was goneNelsons Column

When he came round a second later he found he  wassobbing for his motherHe jerked himself violently to his feetFordFord looked up from where he was sitting in a corner  humming  tohimself He always found the actual travellingthroughspace partof space travel rather tryingYeah he saidIf youre a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earthyou must have been gathering material on itWell I was able to extend the original entry a bit yesLet me see what it says in this edition then Ive  got  to  seeitYeah OK He passed it over againArthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking Hepressed  the  entry for the relevant page The screen flashed andswirled and resolved into a page of print Arthur stared at itIt doesnt have an entry he burst outFord looked over his shoulderYes it does he said down there see at  the  bottom  of  thescreen  just  under  Eccentrica  Gallumbits the triplebreastedwhore of Eroticon Arthur followed Fords finger and saw where it was pointing Fora moment it still didnt register then his mind nearly blew upWhat Harmless Is that all  its  got  to  say  Harmless  OnewordFord shruggedWell there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and  onlya  limited  amount  of  space  in the books microprocessors hesaid and no one knew much about the Earth of courseWell for Gods sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bitOh yes well I managed to  transmit  a  new  entry  off  to  theeditor He had to trim it a bit but its still an improvementAnd what does it say now asked ArthurMostly harmless admitted  Ford  with  a  slightly  embarrassedcoughMostly harmless shouted ArthurWhat was that noise hissed FordIt was me shouting shouted ArthurNo Shut up said Ford I think were in troubleYou think were in troubleOutside the door were the sounds of marching feetThe Dentrassi whispered ArthurNo those are steel tipped boots said FordThere was a sharp ringing rap on the doorThen who is it said ArthurWell said Ford if were lucky its just the Vogons  come  tothrow us in to spaceAnd if were unluckyIf were unlucky said  Ford  grimly  the  captain  might  beserious  in  his  threat  that  hes going to read us some of hispoetry first

poetry of all  perished  along  with  its  creatorPaula  Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge Essex England inthe destruction of the planet EarthProstetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly This was done  not  somuch for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequenceof muscle movements He had had a terribly  therapeutic  yell  athis  prisoners  and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for alittle callousnessThe prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation  Chairs  strapped  inVogons  suffered  no  illusions as to the regard their works weregenerally held in Their early attempts at composition  had  beenpart  of  bludgeoning  insistence  that  they  be  accepted  as aproperly evolved and cultured race but now the only  thing  thatkept them going was sheer bloodymindednessThe sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefects brow and  slid  roundthe  electrodes strapped to his temples These were attached to abattery of electronic equipment  imagery intensifiers  rhythmicmodulators  alliterative  residulators  and simile dumpers  alldesigned to heighten the experience of the  poem  and  make  surethat not a single nuance of the poets thought was lostArthur Dent sat and quivered He had no idea what he was in  forbut  he  knew  that he hadnt liked anything that had happened sofar and didnt think things were likely to changeThe Vogon began to read  a  fetid  little  passage  of

from  a  small  planet in the vicinity ofBetelgeuse and wouldnt have cared if he  had  I  present  youwith  a simple choice Either die in the vacuum of space or he paused for melodramatic effect tell me how good you  thoughtmy poem wasHe threw himself backwards into a huge leathery  batshaped  seatand watched them He did the smile againFord was rasping for breath He rolled his dusty tongue round hisparched mouth and moanedArthur said brightly Actually I quite liked itFord turned and gaped Here was an approach that had quite simplynot occurred to himThe Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow  that  effectively  obscuredhis nose and was therefore no bad thingOh good  he whirred in considerable astonishmentOh yes said Arthur I thought that some of  the  metaphysicalimagery was really particularly effectiveFord continued to stare at him slowly  organizing  his  thoughtsaround  this  totally  new  concept Were they really going to beable to bareface their way out of thisYes do continue  invited the VogonOh  and er  interesting rhythmic devices  too  continuedArthur  which  seemed to counterpoint the  er  er  HeflounderedFord leaped to his rescue hazarding counterpoint the surrealismof  the underlying metaphor of the  er  He floundered toobut Arthur was ready again humanity of the Vogonity Ford hissed at himAh yes Vogonity sorry  of  the  poets  compassionate  soulArthur  felt  he  was  on  a  home  stretch now which contrivesthrough the medium of the  verse  structure  to  sublimate  thistranscend   that   and   come  to  terms  with  the  fundamentaldichotomies  of  the  other  he  was  reaching  a   triumphantcrescendo  and one is left with a profound and vivid insightinto  into  er   which suddenly gave out  on  himFord leaped in with the coup de grceInto whatever it was the poem was about he yelled Out of  thecorner of his mouth Well done Arthur that was very goodThe Vogon perused them For a moment his embittered  racial  soulhad  been  touched  but he thought no  too little too late Hisvoice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylonSo what youre saying is that I write poetry because  underneathmy  mean  callous  heartless  exterior  I  really just want to beloved he said He paused Is that rightFord laughed a nervous laugh Well I mean yes he said  dontwe all deep down you know  er The Vogon stood upNo well youre completely wrong he said I just write poetryto  throw  my  mean callous heartless exterior into sharp reliefIm going to throw you off  the  ship  anyway  Guard  Take  theprisoners to number three airlock and throw them outWhat shouted FordA huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them  out  oftheir straps with his huge blubbery armsYou cant throw us into space yelled Ford  were  trying  towrite a bookResistance is useless shouted the Vogon guard back at him  Itwas  the  first phrase hed learnt when he joined the Vogon GuardCorpsThe captain watched with detached amusement and then turned awayArthur stared round him wildlyI dont want to die now he yelled Ive still got a headacheI  dont  want  to go to heaven with a headache Id be all crossand wouldnt enjoy itThe guard grasped them both firmly round  the  neck  and  bowingdeferentially  towards  his  captains  back  hoiked  them  bothprotesting out of the bridge A steel door closed and the captainwas  on  his  own  again He hummed quietly and mused to himselflightly fingering his notebook of versesHmmmm he said counterpoint the surrealism of the  underlyingmetaphor    He  considered this for a moment and then closedthe book with a grim smileDeaths too good for them he saidThe long steellined corridor echoed to the feeble  struggles  ofthe two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpitsThis is great spluttered Arthur this is really terrific Letgo of me you bruteThe Vogon guard dragged them onDont you worry said  Ford  Ill  think  of  something  Hedidnt sound hopefulResistance is useless bellowed the guardJust dont say things  like  that  stammered  Ford  How  cananyone  maintain  a  positive  mental  attitude  if youre sayingthings like thatMy God complained Arthur youre  talking  about  a  positivemental  attitude  and you havent even had your planet demolishedtoday I woke up this morning and thought Id have a nice relaxedday  do  a bit of reading brush the dog  Its now just afterfour in the afternoon and Im already  thrown  out  of  an  alienspaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the EarthHe spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his gripAlright said Ford just stop panickingWho said anything about panicking  snapped  Arthur  This  isstill  just  the  culture  shock You wait till Ive settled downinto the  situation  and  found  my  bearings  Then  Ill  startpanickingArthur  youre  getting  hysterical  Shut   up   Ford   trieddesperately  to  think but was interrupted by the guard shoutingagainResistance is uselessAnd you can shut up as well snapped FordResistance is uselessOh give it a rest said Ford He twisted his head till  he  waslooking straight up into his captors face A thought struck himDo you really enjoy this sort of thing he asked suddenlyThe Vogon stopped dead and a look  of  immense  stupidity  seepedslowly over his faceEnjoy he boomed What do you meanWhat I mean said Ford is does it give you a full  satisfyinglife Stomping around shouting pushing people out of spaceshipsThe Vogon stared up at the low steel  ceiling  and  his  eyebrowsalmost  rolled  over  each  other  His mouth slacked Finally hesaid Well the hours are good Theyd have to be agreed FordArthur twisted his head to look at FordFord what are you doing he asked in an amazed whisperOh just trying to take an interest in the world around me OKhe said So the hours are pretty good then he resumedThe Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts  moiled  aroundin the murky depthsYeah he said but now you come to mention  it  most  of  theactual  minutes  are  pretty lousy Except  he thought againwhich required looking at the  ceiling    except  some  of  theshouting  I  quite  like  He  filled  his  lungs  and bellowedResistance is Sure yes interrupted Ford hurriedly youre good at that  Ican  tell  But if its mostly lousy he said slowly giving thewords time to reach their mark then why do you do it  What  isit  The  girls  The  leather The machismo Or do you just findthat coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all  presentsan interesting challengeEr  said the guard er  er  I dunno I think  I  justsort of  do it really My aunt said that spaceship guard was agood career for a young Vogon  you know the uniform  the  lowslung stun ray holster the mindless tedium There you are  Arthur  said  Ford  with  the  air  of  someonereaching  the  conclusion  of his argument you think youve gotproblemsArthur rather thought he had Apart from the unpleasant  businesswith  his  home  planet  the  Vogon  guard had halfthrottled himalready and he didnt like the sound of being thrown  into  spacevery muchTry and understand his problem insisted Ford Here he is poorlad  his  entire lifes work is stamping around throwing peopleoff spaceships And shouting added the guardAnd shouting sure said Ford patting the blubbery arm  clampedround  his  neck  in  friendly condescension  and he doesnteven know why hes doing itArthur agreed this was very sad He did this with a small  feeblegesture because he was too asphyxicated to speakDeep rumblings of bemusement came from the guardWell Now you put it like that I suppose Good lad encouraged FordBut  alright  went  on   the   rumblings   so   whats   thealternativeWell said Ford brightly but slowly stop doing it of courseTell  them  he went on youre not going to do it anymore Hefelt he had to add something to that  but  for  the  moment  theguard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that muchEerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  said the  guard erm well that doesnt sound that great to meFord suddenly felt the moment slipping awayNow wait a minute he said thats just  the  start  you  seetheres more to it than that you see But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and  continued  hisoriginal  purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock He wasobviously quite touchedNo I think if its all the same to you he said  Id  betterget you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on withsome other bits of shouting Ive got to doIt wasnt all the same to Ford Prefect after allCome on now  but look he said less slowly less brightlyHuhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn    said  Arthur   without   any   clearinflectionBut hang on pursued Ford theres music and art and things totell you about yet ArrrggghhhResistance is useless bellowed the guard and then added Yousee  if  I  keep  it  up  I can eventually get promoted to SeniorShouting Officer and there arent  usually  many  vacancies  fornonshouting  and  nonpushingpeopleabout  officers so I thinkId better stick to what I knowThey had now  reached  the  airlock    a  large  circular  steelhatchway  of  massive strength and weight let into the inner skinof the craft The guard operated a control and the hatchway swungsmoothly openBut thanks for taking an interest said the Vogon  guard  Byenow  He  flung  Ford  and  Arthur through the hatchway into thesmall  chamber  within  Arthur  lay  panting  for  breath  Fordscrambled  round  and  flung  his  shoulder uselessly against thereclosing hatchwayBut listen he shouted to the guard theres a whole world youdont  know  anything about  here how about this Desperatelyhe grabbed for the only bit of  culture  he  knew  offhand    hehummed the first bar of Beethovens FifthDa da da dum Doesnt that stir anything in youNo said the guard not really But  Ill  mention  it  to  myauntIf he said anything further after that it was lost The  hatchwaysealed itself tight and all sound was lost but the faint distanthum of the ships enginesThey were in a brightly polished cylindrical  chamber  about  sixfeet in diameter and ten feet longPotentially bright lad I thought he said and  slumped  againstthe curved wallArthur was still lying in the curve of the  floor  where  he  hadfallen He didnt look up He just lay pantingWere trapped now arent weYes said Ford were trappedWell didnt you think of anything I thought you said  you  weregoing to think of something Perhaps you thought of something anddidnt noticeOh yes I thought of something panted Ford Arthur  looked  upexpectantlyBut unfortunately continued Ford it rather involved being onthe  other  side  of this airtight hatchway He kicked the hatchtheyd just been throughBut it was a good idea was itOh yes very neatWhat was itWell I hadnt worked out the details yet Not much point now  isthereSo  er what happens nextOh er well the hatchway in front of us will open automaticallyin  a  few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expectand asphyxicate If you take a lungful of air with  you  you  canlast  for up to thirty seconds of course  said Ford He stuckhis hands behind his back raised his eyebrows and started to human  old  Betelgeusian  battle  hymn To Arthurs eyes he suddenlylooked very alienSo this is it said Arthur were going to dieYes said Ford except  no Wait  a  minute  he  suddenlylunged  across  the  chamber at something behind Arthurs line ofvision Whats this switch he criedWhat Where cried Arthur twisting roundNo I was only fooling said Ford we are going to  die  afterallHe slumped against the wall again and carried on  the  tune  fromwhere he left offYou know said Arthur its  at  times  like  this  when  Imtrapped  in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and aboutto die of asphyxication in deep space  that  I  really  wish  Idlistened to what my mother told me when I was youngWhy what did she tell youI dont know I didnt listenOh Ford carried on hummingThis is terrific Arthur thought to himself  Nelsons  Columnhas  gone  McDonalds  have  gone all thats left is me and thewords Mostly Harmless Any second now all that will  be  left  isMostly  Harmless  And yesterday the planet seemed to be going sowellA motor whirredA slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air  as  theouter  hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tinyimpossibly bright points of light Ford and  Arthur  popped  intoouter space like corks from a toy gunThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the  Galaxy  is  a  wholly  remarkablebook  It  has  been compiled and recompiled many times over manyyears  and  under  many  different   editorships   It   containscontributions   from   countless   numbers   of   travellers  andresearchersThe introduction begins like thisSpace it says is big Really big You just wont believe howvastly  hugely mindboggingly big it is I mean you may think itsa long way down the road to the chemist but thats just  peanutsto space Listen  and so onAfter a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tellyou  things  you  really  need  to  know  like the fact that thefabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so  worried  aboutthe  cumulative  erosion  by ten billion visiting tourists a yearthat any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the  amountyou  excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from yourbodyweight when you leave so every time you go to  the  lavatoryit is vitally important to get a receiptTo be fair though when  confronted  by  the  sheer  enormity  ofdistances   between   the   stars  better  minds  than  the  oneresponsible for the  Guides  introduction  have  faltered  Someinvite  you  to  consider  for a moment a peanut in reading and asmall walnut in Johannesburg and other such dizzying conceptsThe simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit intothe human imaginationEven light which travels  so  fast  that  it  takes  most  racesthousands  of years to realize that it travels at all takes timeto journey between the stars It takes  eight  minutes  from  thestar  Sol to the place where the Earth used to be and four yearsmore to arrive at Sols nearest stellar neighbour Alpha ProximaFor light to reach the other side of the Galaxy for it to  reachDamogran for instance takes rather longer five hundred thousandyearsThe record for hitch hiking this  distance  is  just  under  fiveyears but you dont get to see much on the wayThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy says that  if  you  hold  alungful  of  air you can survive in the total vacuum of space forabout thirty seconds However it goes on to say  that  what  withspace  being  the mind boggling size it is the chances of gettingpicked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two  tothe  power  of two hundred and sixtyseven thousand seven hundredand nine to one againstBy a totally staggering coincidence that is  also  the  telephonenumber of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very goodparty and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get  offwith  she went off with a gatecrasherThough the planet Earth the Islington  flat  and  the  telephonehave  all  now  been demolished it is comforting to reflect thatthey are all in some small way  commemorated  by  the  fact  thattwentynine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescuedA computer chatted to itself in alarm as it  noticed  an  airlockopen and close itself for no apparent reasonThis was because Reason was in fact out to lunchA hole had  just  appeared  in  the  Galaxy  It  was  exactly  anothingth  of  a  second  long  a nothingth of an inch wide andquite a lot of million light years from end to endAs it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out ofit  and  drifted off through the universe A team of seven threefoothigh market analysts fell out of  it  and  died  partly  ofasphyxication partly of surpriseTwo hundred and thirtynine thousand lightly fried eggs fell  outof  it  too  materializing in a large woobly heap on the faminestruck land of Poghril in the Pansel systemThe whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except  for  onelast man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks laterThe nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberatedbackwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashionSomewhere in the deeply remote past it  seriously  traumatized  asmall  random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterilityof space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarilyunlikely   patterns   These  patterns  quickly  learnt  to  copythemselves this was part of what was  so  extraordinary  of  thepatterns  and  went  on to cause massive trouble on every planetthey drifted on to That was how life began in the UniverseFive wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of  unreasonand spewed up a pavementOn the pavement lay Ford Prefect and  Arthur  Dent  gulping  likehalfspent fishThere you are gasped Ford scrabbling for a fingerhold on  thepavement  as  it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown Itold you Id think of somethingOh sure said Arthur sureBright idea of mine said Ford to find  a  passing  spaceshipand get rescued by itThe real universe arched sickeningly away beneath  them  Variouspretend  ones  flitted  silently  by like mountain goats Primallight exploded splattering spacetime as with gobbets of junketTime  blossomed  matter  shrank  away  The highest prime numbercoalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for everOh come off it said  Arthur  the  chances  against  it  wereastronomicalDont knock it it worked said FordWhat sort of ship are  we  in  asked  Arthur  as  the  pit  ofeternity yawned beneath themI dont know said Ford I havent opened my eyes yetNo nor have I said ArthurThe Universe jumped froze quivered and splayed out  in  severalunexpected directionsArthur  and  Ford  opened  their  eyes  and   looked   about   inconsiderable surpriseGood god said Arthur it looks just like  the  sea  front  atSouthendHell Im relieved to hear you say that said FordWhyBecause I thought I must be going madPerhaps you are Perhaps you only thought I said itFord thought about thisWell did you say it or didnt you he askedI think so said ArthurWell perhaps were both going madYes said Arthur wed be mad all things considered to thinkthis was SouthendWell do you think this is SouthendOh yesSo do ITherefore we must be madNice day for itYes said a passing maniacWho was that asked ArthurWho  the man with the five heads and the elderberry  bush  fullof kippersYesI dont know Just someoneAhThey both sat on the pavement and watched with a  certain  uneaseas  huge  children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horsesthundered through the sky taking  fresh  supplies  of  reinforcedrailings to the Uncertain AreasYou know  said  Arthur  with  a  slight  cough  if  this  isSouthend theres something very odd about it You mean the way the sea stays steady  and  the  buildings  keepwashing up and down said Ford Yes I thought that was odd tooIn fact he continued as with a huge bang Southend split  itselfinto  six equal segments which danced and span giddily round eachother in lewd  and  licentious  formation  there  is  somethingaltogether very strange going onWild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the windhot  doughnuts  popped out of the road for ten pence each horridfish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make arun for itThey plunged through heavy walls of sound mountains  of  archaic thought  valleys  of  mood music bad shoe sessions and footlingbats and suddenly heard a girls voiceIt sounded quite a sensible voice but it just said Two to  thepower  of  one  hundred thousand to one against and falling andthat was allFord skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find asource  for  the  voice  but could see nothing he could seriouslybelieve inWhat was that voice shouted ArthurI dont know yelled Ford I dont know  It  sounded  like  ameasurement of probabilityProbability What do you meanProbability You know like two to one three to  one  five  tofour against It said two to the power of one hundred thousand toone against Thats pretty improbable you knowA milliongallon vat of custard upended itself over them  withoutwarningBut what does it mean cried ArthurWhat the custardNo the measurement of probabilityI dont know I dont know at all I think were on some kind ofspaceshipI can only assume said Arthur that this is  not  the  firstclass compartmentBulges appeared in the fabric of spacetime Great ugly bulgesHaaaauuurrgghhh  said Arthur as he felt his  body  softeningand  bending in unusual directions Southend seems to be meltingaway  the stars are swirling  a dustbowl   my  legs  aredrifting  off  into the sunset  my left arms come off too Afrightening thought struck him Hell he said how am I  goingto  operate  my digital watch now He wound his eyes desperatelyaround in Fords directionFord he said youre turning into a penguin Stop itAgain came the voiceTwo to the power of seventyfive thousand  to  one  against  andfallingFord waddled around his pond in a furious circleHey who are you he quacked Where are you Whats  going  onand is there any way of stopping itPlease relax said the voice pleasantly like a  stewardess  inan airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is onfire you are perfectly safeBut thats not the point raged Ford The point is that  I  amnow  a  perfectly  save penguin and my colleague here is rapidlyrunning out of limbsIts alright Ive got them back now said ArthurTwo to the power of fifty thousand to one against and  fallingsaid the voiceAdmittedly said Arthur theyre longer than  I  usually  likethem but Isnt there anything squawked Ford in avian  fury  you  feelyou ought to be telling usThe voice cleared its throat A giant  petit  four  lolloped  offinto the distanceWelcome the voice said to the Starship Heart of GoldThe voice continuedPlease do not be alarmed it said by anything you see or heararound you You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as youhave been rescued from certain death at an improbability level oftwo  to  the power of two hundred and seventysix thousand to oneagainst  possibly much higher We are now cruising at a level oftwo  to  the  power  of  twentyfive  thousand to one against andfalling and we will be restoring normality just as  soon  as  weare  sure  what  is normal anyway Thank you Two to the power oftwenty thousand to one against and fallingThe voice cut outFord and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicleFord was wildly excitedArthur he said this is fantastic Weve been picked up by  aship  powered  by  the  Infinite  Improbability  Drive  This  isincredible I  heard  rumors  about  it  before  They  were  allofficially  denied but they must have done it Theyve built theImprobability  Drive  Arthur  this  is      Arthur   WhatshappeningArthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle tryingto  hold  it  closed  but  it was ill fitting Tiny furry littlehands were squeezing themselves through the cracks their fingerswere inkstained tiny voices chattered insanelyArthur looked upFord he said theres an infinite number of  monkeys  outsidewho  want  to  talk  to  us  about this script for Hamlet theyveworked outThe Infinite Improbability Drive is a  wonderful  new  method  ofcrossing  vast  interstellar  distances  in a mere nothingth of asecond without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspaceIt was discovered by a lucky chance and then  developed  into  agovernable  form  of  propulsion  by  the  Galactic  Governmentsresearch team on DamogranThis briefly is the story of its discoveryThe principle of generating small amounts of finite improbabilityby  simply  hooking  the  logic circuits of a Bambleweeny  SubMeson Brain to an atomic vector plotter  suspended  in  a  strongBrownian  Motion  producer  say  a  nice hot cup of tea were ofcourse well understood  and such generators were often  used  tobreak  the  ice  at  parties  by  making all the molecules in thehostesss undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the leftin accordance with the Theory of IndeterminacyMany respectable physicists said that they werent going to standfor  this    partly  because it was a debasement of science butmostly because they didnt get invited to those sort of partiesAnother thing they couldnt stand was the perpetual failure  theyencountered in trying to construct a machine which could generatethe infinite improbability  field  needed  to  flip  a  spaceshipacross  the mindparalysing distances between the furthest starsand in the end they grumpily announced that such  a  machine  wasvirtually impossibleThen one day a student who had been left to sweep  up  the  labafter  a  particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoningthis wayIf  he  thought  to  himself  such  a  machine  is  a   virtualimpossibility  then it must logically be a finite improbabilitySo all I have to do in order to make one is to work  out  exactlyhow   improbable   it  is  feed  that  figure  into  the  finiteimprobability generator give it a fresh cup of  really  hot  tea and turn it onHe did this and was rather startled  to  discover  that  he  hadmanaged   to   create  the  long  sought  after  golden  InfiniteImprobability generator out of thin airIt startled him even more when just  after  he  was  awarded  theGalactic  Institutes Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynchedby a rampaging mob of  respectable  physicists  who  had  finallyrealized  that  the  one  thing  they really couldnt stand was asmartassThe Improbabilityproof control cabin of the Heart of Gold lookedlike  a  perfectly  conventional  spaceship  except  that  it wasperfectly clean because it was so new Some of the control  seatshadnt  had  the  plastic  wrapping  taken off yet The cabin wasmostly  white  oblong  and  about  the  size  of   a   smallishrestaurant  In  fact  it  wasnt  perfectly oblong the two longwalls were raked round in a slight parallel curve  and  all  theangles  and  corners  were contoured in excitingly chunky shapesThe truth of the matter is that it would have been a  great  dealsimpler  and  more  practical  to  build the cabin as an ordinarythreedimensional oblong rom but then the designers  would  havegot  miserable As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposefulwith large video screens ranged over  the  control  and  guidancesystem  panels  on  the concave wall and long banks of computersset into the convex wall In one corner a robot sat  humped  itsgleaming  brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleamingbrushed steel knees It too was fairly new  but  though  it  wasbeautifully  constructed and polished it somehow looked as if thevarious parts of its more or less humanoid body didnt quite  fitproperly  In  fact  they fitted perfectly well but something inits bearing suggested that they might have fitted betterZaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin brushinghis  hands  over  pieces  of gleaming equipment and giggling withexcitementTrillian sat hunched over a  clump  of  instruments  reading  offfigures  Her  voice  was  carried round the Tannoy system of thewhole shipFive to one against and falling   she  said  four  to  oneagainst  and  falling    three  to  one    two   one probability factor of one to one  we have normality I  repeatwe  have  normality She turned her microphone off  then turnedit back on with a slight  smile  and  continued  Anything  youstill  cant  cope  with  is  therefore  your own problem Pleaserelax You will be sent for soonZaphod burst out in annoyance Who are they TrillianTrillian span her seat round to face him and shruggedJust a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open  spaceshe said Section ZZ Plural Z AlphaYeah well thats a very  sweet  thought  Trillian  complainedZaphod   but   do   you   really  think  its  wise  under  thecircumstances I mean here we are on the run and everything  wemust  have  the police of half the Galaxy after us by now and westop to pick up hitch hikers OK so ten out of  ten  for  stylebut minus several million for good thinking yeahHe tapped irritably at a control panel  Trillian  quietly  movedhis  hand  before he tapped anything important Whatever Zaphodsqualities of mind might include  dash bravado conceit  he wasmechanically  inept  and  could  easily  blow the ship up with anextravagant gesture Trillian had come to suspect that  the  mainreason  why  he  had  had such a wild and successful life that henever really understood the significance of anything he didZaphod she said patiently they were floating unprotected  inopen space  you wouldnt want them to have died would youWell you know  no Not as such but Not as such Not die as such But Trillian cocked her head  onone sideWell maybe someone else might have picked them up laterA second later and they would have been deadYeah so if youd taken the trouble to think about the problem abit longer it would have gone awayYoud been happy to let them dieWell you know not happy as such but Anyway said Trillian turning back to the controls I  didntpick them upWhat do you mean Who picked them up thenThe ship didHuhThe ship did All by itselfHuhWhilst we were in Improbability DriveBut thats incredibleNo Zaphod Just very very improbableEr yeahLook Zaphod she said patting his arm dont worry about  thealiens  Theyre  just  a  couple of guys I expect Ill send therobot down to get them and bring them up here Hey MarvinIn the corner the  robots  head  swung  up  sharply  but  thenwobbled  about imperceptibly  It pulled itself up to its feet asif it was about five pounds heavier that  it  actually  was  andmade  what  an  outside  observer would have thought was a heroiceffort to cross the room It stopped in  front  of  Trillian  andseemed to stare through her left shoulderI think you ought to know Im feeling very depressed it  saidIts voice was low and hopelessOh God muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seatWell said Trillian in a  bright  compassionate  tone  heressomething to

convey his utter contempt and horror  of  allthings humanJust that he saidYes said Trillian firmlyI wont enjoy it said MarvinZaphod leaped out of his seatShes not asking you to enjoy it he shouted just do it  willyouAlright said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked  bellIll do itGood  snapped Zaphod great  thank you Marvin turned and lifted his flattopped triangular red  eyes  uptowards himIm not getting you down at all am I he said patheticallyNo no Marvin lilted Trillian thats just fine really I wouldnt like to think that I was getting you downNo dont worry about that the lilt continued you  just  actas comes naturally and everything will be just fineYoure sure you dont mind probed MarvinNo no Marvin lilted Trillian thats just  fine  really  just part of lifeMarvin flashed him an electronic lookLife said Marvin dont talk to me about lifeHe turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself  out  of  thecabin  With  a  satisfied hum and a click the door closed behindhimI

Improbability itpasses through every point in the Universe Be the envy of  othermajor governments Wow this is big league stuffFord hunted excitedly through the technical specs  of  the  shipoccasionally  gasping with astonishment at what he read  clearlyGalactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of  hisexileArthur listened for a short while but being unable to understandthe  vast  majority  of  what Ford was saying he began to let hismind  wander  trailing  his  fingers  along  the  edge   of   anincomprehensible  computer  bank  he  reached out and pressed aninvitingly large red button on a nearby panel The panel  lit  upwith  the  words  Please do not press this button again He shookhimselfListen said  Ford  who  was  still  engrossed  in  the

thatOh it says Genuine People PersonalitiesOh said Arthur sounds ghastlyA voice behind them said It is The voice was low and hopelessand  accompanied  by a slight clanking sound They span round andsaw

to operate  For  yearsradios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turningdials then as  the  technology  became  more  sophisticated  thecontrols  were made touchsensitive  you merely had to brush thepanels with your fingers now all you had to  do  was  wave  yourhand  in  the  general  direction  of the components and hope Itsaved a lot of muscular expenditure of course but meant that youhad to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening tothe same programmeZaphod waved a hand and the channel  switched  again  More  gunkmusic  but this time it was a background to a news announcementThe news was always heavily edited to  fit  the  rhythms  of  themusic and news brought to you here  on  the  subetha  wave  bandbroadcasting  around  the  galaxy  around  the clock squawked avoice and well be saying a big hello to all  intelligent  lifeforms  everywhere   and to everyone else out there the secretis to bang the rocks together guys And of course the big  newsstory  tonight  is the sensational theft of the new ImprobabilityDrive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President ZaphodBeeblebrox And the question everyones asking is  has the bigZ finally flipped Beeblebrox  the  man  who  invented  the  PanGalactic  Gargle Blaster exconfidence trickster once describedby Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One  andrecently  voted  the  Wort  Dressed  Sentinent Being in the KnownUniverse for the seventh time  has he got an answer this timeWe  asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt  Themusic swirled and dived for a moment  Another  voice  broke  inpresumably  Halfrunt  He  said Vell Zaphods jist zis guy youknow but got no further because an electric pencil flew  acrossthe  cabin  and  through  the  radios onoff sensitive airspaceZaphod turned and glared at Trillian  she had thrown the pencilHey he said what do you do that forTrillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figuresIve just thought of something she saidYeah Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me forYou hear enough about yourself as it isIm very insecure We know thatCan we drop your ego for a moment This is importantIf theres anything more important than my ego around I want itcaught and shot now Zaphod glared at her again then laughedListen she said we picked up those couple of guys What couple of guysThe couple of guys we picked upOh yeah said Zaphod those couple of guysWe picked them up in sector ZZ  Plural Z AlphaYeah said Zaphod and blinkedTrillian said quietly Does that mean anything to youMmmmm said Zaphod ZZ  Plural Z Alpha ZZ  Plural Z AlphaWell said TrillianEr  what does the Z mean said ZaphodWhich oneAny oneOne  of  the  major  difficulties  Trillian  experienced  in  herrelationship  with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between himpretending to be stupid just  to  get  people  off  their  guardpretending  to be stupid because he couldnt be bothered to thinkand wanted someone else to  do  it  for  him  pretending  to  beoutrageously  stupid  to  hide  the  fact that he actually didntunderstand what was going on and really being genuinely  stupidHe  was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly wasso  but not all the time which obviously worried him hence theact  He proffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuousThis above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely  stupid  butshe could no longer be bothered to argue about itShe sighed and punched up a star map on  the  visiscreen  so  shecould make it simple for him whatever his reasons for wanting itto be that wayThere she pointed right thereHey  Yeah said ZaphodWell she saidWell whatParts of the inside of her head screamed at other  parts  of  theinside  of her head She said very calmly Its the same sectoryou originally picked me up inHe looked at her and then looked back at the screenHey yeah he said now that is wild We  should  have  zappedstraight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula How did we cometo be there I mean thats nowhereShe ignored thisImprobability Drive she said patiently You explained  it  tome  yourself  We  pass  through every point in the Universe youknow thatYeah but thats one wild coincidence isnt itYesPicking someone up at that  point  Out  of  the  whole  of  theUniverse  to choose from Thats just too  I want to work thisout ComputerThe  Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Shipboard  Computer  whichcontrolled   and  permeated  every  particle of the ship switchedinto communication modeHi there it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tinyribbon  of ticker tape just for the record The ticker tape saidHi thereOh God said Zaphod He hadnt worked with  this  computer  forlong but had already learned to loathe itThe computer continued brash and cheery as  if  it  was  sellingdetergentI want you to know that whatever your problem I am here to helpyou solve itYeah yeah said Zaphod Look I think Ill just use a piece ofpaperSure thing said the computer spilling out its message into  awaste bin at the same time I understand If you ever want Shut up said Zaphod and snatching up a pencil sat  down  nextto Trillian at the consoleOK OK  said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closeddown its speech channel againZaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbabilityflight path scanner flashed silently up in front of themCan we work out said Zaphod from their point  of  view  whatthe Improbability of their rescue wasYes thats a constant said Trillian two to the power of twohundred  and  seventysix  thousand seven hundred and nine to oneagainstThats high Theyre two lucky lucky guysYesBut relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them  upTrillian punched up the figures They  showed  towtothe  powerofInfinityminusone  an  irrational  number  that  only  has aconventional meaning in Improbability physics its pretty low continued Zaphod with a slight whistleYes agreed Trillian and looked at him quizzicallyThats one big whack  of  Improbability  to  be  accounted  forSomething  pretty  improbable  has  got to show up on the balancesheet if its all going to add up into a pretty sumZaphod scribbled a few sums  crossed  them  out  and  threw  thepencil awayBats dots I cant work it outWellZaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation  and  grittedhis teethOK he said ComputerThe voice circuits sprang to life againWhy hello there they said ticker tape ticker tape  All  Iwant to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer Yeah well shut up and work something out for meSure thing chattered the computer  you  want  a  probabilityforecast based on Improbability data yeahOK the  computer  continued  Heres  an  interesting  littlenotion  Did you realize that most peoples lives are governed bytelephone numbersA pained look crawled across one of Zaphods faces and on to  theother oneHave you flipped he saidNo but you will when I tell you that Trillian  gasped  She  scrabbled   at   the   buttons   on   theImprobability flight path screenTelephone number she  said  Did  that  thing  say  telephonenumberNumbers flashed up on the screenThe computer had paused politely but now it continuedWhat I was about to say was that Dont bother please said TrillianLook what is this said ZaphodI dont know said Trillian but those aliens  theyre on theway  up  to the bridge with that wretched robot Can we pick themup on any monitor camerasMarvin trudged on down the corridor still moaning and then of course Ive got this terrible pain  in  all  thediodes down my left hand side No said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him ReallyOh yes said Marvin I mean Ive asked for them to be replacedbut no one ever listensI can imagineVague whistling and humming noises were coming from  Ford  Wellwell well he kept saying to himself Zaphod Beeblebrox Suddenly Marvin stopped and held up a handYou know whats happened now of courseNo what said Arthur who didnt what to knowWeve arrived at another of those doorsThere was a sliding door let  into  the  side  of  the  corridorMarvin eyed it suspiciouslyWell said Ford impatiently Do we go throughDo we go through mimicked Marvin Yes This is  the  entranceto the bridge I was told to take you to the bridge Probably thehighest demand that will be made on  my  intellectual  capacitiestoday I shouldnt wonderSlowly with great loathing he stepped towards the door like  ahunter stalking his prey Suddenly it slid openThank you it said for making a simple door very happyDeep in Marvins thorax gears groundFunny he intoned funerally how  just  when  you  think  lifecant possibly get any worse it suddenly doesHe heaved himself through the  door  and  left  Ford  and  Arthurstaring  at each other and shrugging their shoulders From insidethey heard Marvins voice againI suppose you want to see the aliens now he said Do you wantme  to  sit  in  a  corner and rust or just fall apart where ImstandingYeah just show them in would you Marvin came another voiceArthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughingWhats Shhh said Ford come inHe stepped through into the bridgeArthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a  manlolling  back  in  a  chair  with  his  feet on a control consolepicking the teeth in his righthand head with his left hand  Therighthand  head  seemed  to  be thoroughly preoccupied with thistask but the  lefthand  one  was  grinning  a  broad  relaxednonchalant  grin  The  number  of  things  that  Arthur couldntbelieve he was seeing was fairly large His jaw flapped about  ata loose end for a whileThe peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an  appallingaffectation of nonchalance said Ford hi how are you Glad youcould drop inFord was not going to be outcooledZaphod he drawled great to see you youre looking well theextra arm suits you Nice ship youve stolenArthur goggled at himYou mean you know this guy he said waving a  wild  finger  atZaphodKnow him exclaimed Ford hes  he paused and decided  todo the introductions the other way roundOh Zaphod this is a friend of mine Arthur Dent he said  Isaved him when his planet blew upOh sure said Zaphod hi Arthur glad you could make it  Hisrighthand head looked round casually said hi and went back tohaving his teeth pickedFord carried on And Arthur he said this is  my  semicousinZaphod Beeb Weve met said Arthur sharplyWhen youre cruising down the road  in  the  fast  lane  and  youlazily  sail  past a few hard driving cars and are feeling prettypleased with yourself and  then  accidentally  change  down  fromfourth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap outof your bonnet in a rather ugly mess it tends to throw  you  offyour  stride  in  much  the  same way that this remark threw FordPrefect off hisErr  whatI said weve metZaphod gave an  awkward  start  of  surprise  and  jabbed  a  gumsharplyHey  er have we Hey  er Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his  eyes  Now  hefelt  he  was  back  on  home  ground he suddenly began to resenthaving lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew  asmuch about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilfordbased gnat knewabout life in PekingWhat do you mean youve  met  he  demanded  This  is  ZaphodBeeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know not bloody Martin Smithfrom CroydonI dont care said Arthur coldly Weve met havent we  ZaphodBeeblebrox  or should I say  PhilWhat shouted FordYoull have to remind me said Zaphod Ive a terrible  memoryfor speciesIt was at a party pursued ArthurYeah well I doubt that said ZaphodCool it will you Arthur demanded FordArthur would not be deterred A party six months ago  On  Earth England Zaphod shook his head with a tightlipped smileLondon insisted Arthur IslingtonOh said Zaphod with a guilty start that partyThis wasnt fair on Ford at all He looked backwards and forwardsbetween  Arthur and Zaphod What he said to Zaphod You dontmean to say youve been on that miserable planet as well do youNo of course not said Zaphod breezily Well I may have justdropped in briefly you know on my way somewhere But I was stuck there for fifteen yearsWell I didnt know that did IBut what were you doing thereLooking about you knowHe gatecrashed a party persisted Arthur trembling with angera fancy dress party It would have to be wouldnt it said FordAt this party persisted Arthur was a girl  oh well  lookit  doesnt  matter  now  The  whole  place has gone up in smokeanyway I wish youd stop sulking about that bloody planet said  FordWho was the ladyOh just somebody Well alright I wasnt doing  very  well  withher Id been trying all evening Hell she was something thoughBeautiful charming devastatingly intelligent at last  Id  gother  to  myself  for  a bit and was plying her with a bit of talkwhen this friend of yours barges up and says Hey  doll  is  thisguy  boring  you  Why  dont  you talk to me instead Im from adifferent planet I never saw her againZaphod exclaimed FordYes said Arthur  glaring  at  him  and  trying  not  to  feelfoolish He only had the two arms and the one head and he calledhimself Phil but But you must admit he did turn out to be from  another  planetsaid  Trillian  wandering  into  sight  at  the  other end of thebridge She gave Arthur a pleasant smile  which  settled  on  himlike  a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the shipscontrols againThere was silence  for  a  few  seconds  and  then  out  of  thescrambled mess of Arthurs brain crawled some wordsTricia McMillian he said What are you doing hereSame as you she said I hitched a  lift  After  all  with  adegree  in  Maths and another in astrophysics what else was thereto do It was either that or the dole queue again on MondayInfinity minus one chattered the computer Improbability  sumnow completeZaphod looked  about  him  at  Ford  at  Arthur  and  then  atTrillianTrillian he said is this sort of thing going to happen everytime we use the Improbability driveVery probably Im afraid she saidThe Heart of Gold fled on silently through the  night  of  spacenow  on  conventional  photon drive Its crew of four were ill atease knowing that they had been brought together not of their ownvolition  or by simple coincidence but by some curious principleof physics  as if relationships between people were  susceptibleto  the  same  laws that governed the relationships between atomsand moleculesAs the ships artificial night closed in they were each  gratefulto  retire  to  separate  cabins  and  try  to  rationalize theirthoughtsTrillian couldnt sleep She sat on a couch and stared at a smallcage  which  contained  her  last and only links with Earth  twowhite mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her  bring  She  hadexpected  not  to  see the planet again but she was disturbed byher negative  reaction to the  planets  destruction  It  seemedremote  and  unreal and she could find no thoughts to think aboutit She watched the mice scurrying round  the  cage  and  runningfuriously  in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupiedher whole attention Suddenly she shook herself and went back  tothe  bridge  to  watch  over the tiny flashing lights and figuresthat charted the ships progress through the void She wished sheknew what it was she was trying not to think aboutZaphod couldnt sleep He also wished he knew what it was that hewouldnt  let  himself  think  about  For  as  long  as he couldremember hed suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being  notall there Most of the time he was able to put this thought asideand not worry about it but it had been reawakened by the suddeninexplicable  arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent Somehow itseemed to conform to a pattern that he couldnt seeFord couldnt sleep He was too excited about being back  on  theroad again Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over justas he was finally beginning to give up hope Knocking about  withZaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun though there seemedto be  something  faintly  odd  about  his  semicousin  that  hecouldnt put his finger on The fact that he had become Presidentof the Galaxy was frankly astonishing as was the manner  of  hisleaving the post Was there a reason behind it There would be nopoint in asking Zaphod he never appeared to have  a  reason  foranything  he  did  at all he had turned unfathomably into an artform  He  attacked  everything  in  life  with  a   mixture   ofextraordinary  genius  and  naive  incompetence  and it was oftendifficult to tell which was whichArthur slept he was terribly tiredThere was a tap at Zaphods door It slid openZaphod YeahI think we just found what you came to look forHey yeahFord gave up the attempt to sleep In the corner of his cabin wasa  small  computer  screen and keyboard He sat at it for a whileand tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject  ofVogons but couldnt think of anything vitriolic enough so he gavethat up too wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk  tothe bridgeAs he entered  he  was  surprised  to  see  two  figures  hunchedexcitedly over the instrumentsSee The ships about to move into orbit Trillian was  sayingTheres  a  planet  out there Its at the exact coordinates youpredictedZaphod heard a noise and looked upFord he hissed Hey come and take a look at thisFord went and had a look at  it  It  was  a  series  of  figuresflashing over a screenYou recognize those Galactic coordinates said ZaphodNoIll give you a clue ComputerHi gang enthused the computer This is getting real  sociableisnt itShut up said Zaphod and show up the screensLight on the bridge sank Pinpoints of light  played  across  theconsoles  and  reflected  in four pairs of eyes that stared up atthe external monitor screensThere was absolutely nothing on themRecognize that whispered ZaphodFord frownedEr no he saidWhat do you seeNothingRecognize itWhat are you talking aboutWere in the Horsehead Nebula One whole vast dark cloudAnd I was meant to recognize that from a blank screenInside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy youd see adark screenVery goodZaphod laughed He was  clearly  very  excited  about  somethingalmost childishly soHey this is really terrific this is just far too muchWhats so great about being stuck in a dust cloud said FordWhat would you reckon to find here urged ZaphodNothingNo stars No planetsNoComputer shouted Zaphod rotate angle of vision through  oneeighty degrees and dont talk about itFor a moment  it  seemed  that  nothing  was  happening  then  abrightness  glowed at the edge of the huge screen A red star thesize of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by anotherone    a  binary  system  Then  a vast crescent sliced into thecorner of the picture  a red glare shading away  into  the  deepblack the night side of the planetIve found it cried Zaphod thumping the console Ive  founditFord stared at it in astonishmentWhat is it he saidThat  said Zaphod is the most improbable planet that  everexistedExcerpt from The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Page Section a Entry MagratheaFar back in the mists of ancient time in the great and  gloriousdays  of  the  former  Galactic  Empire  life was wild rich andlargely tax freeMighty starships plied their way  between  exotic  suns  seekingadventure  and  reward  amongst  the furthest reaches of Galacticspace In those days spirits were brave the  stakes  were  highmen  were  real  men  women  were  real  women  and small furrycreatures from Alpha Centauri were  real  small  furry  creaturesfrom  Alpha  Centauri And all dared to brave unknown terrors todo mighty deeds to boldly split  infinitives  that  no  man  hadsplit before  and thus was the Empire forgedMany men of course became extremely rich but this was  perfectlynatural  and  nothing  to be ashamed of because no one was reallypoor  at least no one worth speaking of And for all the richestand  most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dulland niggly and they began to imagine that this was therefore thefault of the worlds theyd settled on  none of them was entirelysatisfactory either the climate wasnt quite right in the  laterpart  of  the afternoon or the day was half an hour too long orthe sea was exactly the wrong shade of pinkAnd thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form ofspecialist industry custommade luxury planet building The homeof this industry was the  planet  Magrathea  where  hyperspatialengineers  sucked  matter through white holes in space to form itinto dream planets  gold planets platinum planets soft  rubberplanets  with lots of earthquakes  all lovingly made to meet theexacting standards that the Galaxys richest men  naturally  cameto expectBut so successful was this venture  that  Magrathea  itself  soonbecame  the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxywas reduced to abject poverty And so the system broke down  theEmpire  collapsed  and  a  long  sullen  silence  settled over abillion worlds disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholarsas  they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on thevalue of a planned political economyMagrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into  theobscurity of legendIn these enlightened days of course no one believes  a  word  ofitArthur awoke to the sound of argument and  went  to  the  bridgeFord was waving his arms aboutYoure crazy Zaphod he was saying Magrathea is  a  myth  afairy  story its what parents tell their kids about at night ifthey want them to grow up to become economists its And thats what we are  currently  in  orbit  around  insistedZaphodLook I cant help what you may personally be in orbit  aroundsaid Ford but this ship Computer shouted ZaphodOh no Hi there This is Eddie your shipboard computer and Im feelingjust  great  guys  and  I know Im just going to get a bundle ofkicks out of any programme you care to run through meArthur looked inquiringly at Trillian She motioned him  to  comeon in but keep quietComputer  said  Zaphod  tell  us  again  what  our   presenttrajectory isA real pleasure feller it burbled we are currently in  orbitat an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planetof MagratheaProving nothing said Ford I wouldnt trust that computer  tospeak my weightI can do that for you sure enthused  the  computer  punchingout  more  tickertape  I  can  even  work  out  you personalityproblems to ten decimal places if it will helpTrillian interruptedZaphod she said any minute now we will be swinging round  tothe daylight side of this planet adding whatever it turns outto beHey what do you mean by that The planets where I predicted itwould be isnt itYes I know theres a planet there Im not arguing with anyoneits  just  that I wouldnt know Magrathea from any other lump ofcold rock Dawns coming up if you want itOK OK muttered Zaphod lets at least give our eyes  a  goodtime ComputerHi there What can I Just shut up and give us a view of the planet againA dark featureless mass once more filled the screens  the planetrolling away beneath themThey watched for a moment in silence but Zaphod was fidgety withexcitementWe are now traversing the night side  he said  in  a  hushedvoice The planet rolled onThe surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath  us  he  continued He was trying to restore a sense of occasionto what he felt should have been a great  moment  Magrathea  Hewas piqued by Fords sceptical reaction MagratheaIn a few seconds he continued we should see  thereThe moment carried itself Even  the  most  seasoned  star  trampcant  help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seenfrom space but a binary sunrise is one of  the  marvels  of  theGalaxyOut of the utter blackness stabbed a  sudden  point  of  blindinglight  It  crept  up  by slight degrees and spread sideways in athin crescent blade and within seconds two  suns  were  visiblefurnaces  of  light  searing  the black edge of the horizon withwhite fire Fierce shafts of colour  streaked  through  the  thinatmosphere beneath themThe fires of dawn   breathed  Zaphod  The  twin  suns  ofSoulianis and Rahm  Or whatever said Ford quietlySoulianis and Rahm insisted ZaphodThe suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low  ghostly  musicfloated through the bridge Marvin was humming ironically becausehe hated humans so muchAs Ford gazed at the spectacle of light  before  them  excitementburnt inside him but only the excitement of seeing a strange newplanet it was enough for him to see it as  it  was  It  faintlyirritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy onto the scene to make it work for him All this Magrathea nonsenseseemed  juvenile  Isnt  it  enough  to  see  that  a  garden isbeautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at thebottom of it tooAll this Magrathea business seemed  totally  incomprehensible  toArthur He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going onI only know what Zaphods told me she  whispered  ApparentlyMagrathea  is  some  kind  of  legend  from way back which no oneseriously believes in Bit like Atlantis on  Earth  except  thatthe legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planetsArthur blinked at the screens and felt he was  missing  somethingimportant Suddenly he realized what it wasIs there any tea on this spaceship he askedMore of the planet was unfolding beneath them  as  the  Heart  ofGold  streaked along its orbital path The suns now stood high inthe black sky the  pyrotechnics  of  dawn  were  over  and  thesurface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the commonlight of day  grey dusty and only dimly  contoured  It  lookeddead  and  cold  as a crypt From time to time promising featureswould appear on the distant horizon  ravines  maybe  mountainsmaybe even cities  but as they approached the lines would softenand blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire The planetssurface  was  blurred  by  time by the slow movement of the thinstagnant air that had crept across it for century upon centuryClearly it was very very oldA moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the  grey  landscapemove  beneath  them  The immensity of time worried him he couldfeel it as a presence He cleared his throatWell even supposing it is It is said ZaphodWhich it isnt continued Ford  What  do  you  want  with  itanyway Theres nothing thereNot on the surface said ZaphodAlright just supposing theres something I take it youre  nothere for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all What are youafterOne of Zaphods heads looked away The other one looked round  tosee  what  the  first  was  looking  at but it wasnt looking atanything very muchWell said Zaphod airily its partly the curiosity partly  asense  of  adventure  but  mostly  I think its the fame and themoney Ford glanced at him sharply He got a very strong impression thatZaphod hadnt the faintest idea why he was there at allYou know I dont like the look of  that  planet  at  all  saidTrillian shiveringAh take no notice said Zaphod with half the wealth  of  theformer  Galactic  Empire  stored on it somewhere it can afford tolook frumpyBullshit thought Ford Even supposing this was the home of  someancient civilization now gone to dust even supposing a number ofexceedingly unlikely things there was no way that vast treasuresof  wealth  were  going to be stored there in any form that wouldstill have meaning now He shruggedI think its just a dead planet he saidThe suspense is killing me said Arthur testilyStress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in allparts  of  the  Galaxy  and  it  is in order that this situationshould not in any way be exacerbated  that  the  following  factswill now be revealed in advanceThe planet in question is in fact the legendary MagratheaThe deadly missile attack shortly to be launched  by  an  ancientautomatic  defence  system  will result merely in the breakage ofthree coffee cups and a  micecage  the  bruising  of  somebodysupper  arm and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowlof petunias and an innocent sperm whaleIn order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved norevelation  will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustainedthe bruise This fact may safely be made the subject of  suspensesince it is of no significance whatsoeverAfter a  fairly  shaky  start  to  the  day  Arthurs  mind  wasbeginning  to  reassemble  itself from the shellshocked fragmentsthe previous day had left him with He had  found  a  NutriMaticmachine  which  had provided him with a plastic cup filled with aliquid that was almost but not quite entirely unlike  tea  Theway it functioned was very interesting When the Drink button waspressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of thesubjects  taste  buds a spectroscopic analysis of the subjectsmetabolism and then  sent  tiny  experimental  signals  down  theneural  pathways  to  the taste centres of the subjects brain tosee what was likely to go down well However no one  knew  quitewhy  it  did  this  because  it  invariably delivered a cupful ofliquid that was almost but not quite entirely unlike  tea  TheNutriMatic   was   designed   and  manufactured  by  the  SiriusCybernetics Corporation whose complaints  department  now  coversall  the  major  land  masses  of  the first three planets in theSirius Tau Star systemArthur drank the liquid and found it reviving He glanced  up  atthe  screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barrengreyness slide past  It  suddenly  occurred  to  him  to  ask  aquestion which had been bothering himIs it safe he saidMagratheas been dead for five million years said Zaphod  ofcourse  its  safe  Even  the  ghosts will have settled down andraised  families  by  now  At  which  point   a   strange   andinexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge  a noiseas of a distant fanfare a hollow reedy insubstantial sound Itpreceded   a   voice   that   was   equally   hollow  reedy  andinsubstantial The voice said Greetings to you Someone from the dead planet was talking to themComputer shouted ZaphodHi thereWhat the photon is itOh just some fivemillionyearold tape thats being  broadcastat usA what A recordingShush said Ford Its carrying onThe  voice  was  old  courteous  almost   charming   but   wasunderscored with quite unmistakable menaceThis is a recorded announcement it said as Im afraid  wereall out at the moment The commercial council of Magrathea thanksyou for your esteemed visit A voice from ancient Magrathea shouted Zaphod OK OK saidFord but regrets continued the voice that the  entire  planetis  temporarily closed for business Thank you If you would careto leave your name and the address of a planet where you  can  becontacted kindly speak when you hear the toneA short buzz followed then silenceThey want to get rid of us said Trillian nervously  What  dowe doIts just a recording said Zaphod We keep going  Got  thatcomputerI got it said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick  ofspeedThey waitedAfter a second or so came the fanfare once again  and  then  thevoiceWe would like to assure you that as  soon  as  our  business  isresumed  announcements  will be made in all fashionable magazinesand colour supplements when our clients will once again be  ableto  select  from  all thats best in contemporary geography Themenace in the voice took on a sharper edge Meanwhile  we  thankour  clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leaveNowArthur looked round the nervous faces of his companionsWell I suppose wed  better  be  going  then  hadnt  we  hesuggestedShhh said Zaphod Theres absolutely nothing  to  be  worriedaboutThen whys everyone so tenseTheyre just interested shouted  Zaphod  Computer  start  adescent into the atmosphere and prepare for landingThis time the fanfare was quite perfunctory the voice distinctlycoldIt is most gratifying it said that your enthusiasm  for  ourplanet  continues  unabated  and  so we would like to assure youthat the guided missiles currently converging with your ship  arepart  of  a  special  service  we  extend  to  all  of  our  mostenthusiastic clients and the fully armed nuclear warheads are ofcourse  merely  a courtesy detail We look forward to your customin future lives  thank youThe voice snapped offOh said TrillianEr  said ArthurWell said FordLook said Zaphod will you get it  into  your  heads  Thatsjust  a  recorded message Its millions of years old It doesntapply to us get itWhat said Trillian quietly about the missilesMissiles Dont make me laughFord tapped Zaphod on  the  shoulder  and  pointed  at  the  rearscreen  Clear  in the distance behind them two silver darts wereclimbing through the atmosphere towards the ship A quick  changeof  magnification  brought  them into close focus  two massivelyreal rockets thundering through the sky The suddenness of it wasshockingI think theyre going to have a very good  try  at  applying  tous said FordZaphod stared at them in astonishmentHey this is terrific he said Someone down there is trying tokill usTerrific said ArthurBut dont you see what this meansYes Were going to dieYes but apart from thatApart from thatIt means we must be on to somethingHow soon can we get off itSecond by second the image of the missiles on the  screen  becamelarger  They had swung round now on to a direct homing course sothat all that could be seen of them now was  the  warheads  headonAs a matter of interest said Trillian what are we  going  todoJust keep cool said ZaphodIs that all shouted ArthurNo were also going to  er  take  evasive  action  saidZaphod  with  a  sudden  access of panic Computer what evasiveaction can we takeEr none Im afraid guys said the computer or something said Zaphod  er  he saidThere  seems  to  be  something  jamming  my  guidance  systemexplained   the   computer  brightly  impact  minus  fortyfiveseconds Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relaxZaphod tried  to  run  in  several  equally  decisive  directionssimultaneously Right he said Er  weve got to get manualcontrol of this shipCan you fly her asked Ford pleasantlyNo can youNoTrillian can youNoFine said Zaphod relaxing Well do it togetherI cant either said Arthur who felt it was time he  began  toassert himselfId guessed that said Zaphod OK computer I want full manualcontrol nowYou got it said the computerSeveral large desk panels slid open and banks of control consolessprang  up  out of them showering the crew with bits of expandedpolystyrene packaging and balls of  rolledup  cellophane  thesecontrols had never been used beforeZaphod stared at them wildlyOK  Ford  he  said  full  retro  thrust  and  ten   degreesstarboard Or something Good luck guys chirped  the  computer  impact  minus  thirtyseconds Ford leapt to the  controls    only  a  few  of  them  made  anyimmediate  sense  to  him  so he pulled those The ship shook andscreamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every whichway  simultaneously  He  released half of them and the ship spanround in a tight arc  and  headed  back  the  way  it  had  comestraight towards the oncoming missilesAir cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyonewas  thrown  against  them For a few seconds the inertial forcesheld them flattened and squirming for  breath  unable  to  moveZaphod  struggled  and  pushed  in  manic desperation and finallymanaged a savage kick at a small lever that formed  part  of  theguidance systemThe lever snapped off The  ship  twisted  sharply  and  rocketedupwards  The  crew  were hurled violently back across the cabinFords copy of The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy smashed intoanother  section  of the control console with the combined resultthat the guide started to explain to anyone who cared  to  listenabout  the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out ofAntares an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick  is  arevolting  but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very largesums of money are often paid for them by  very  rich  idiots  whowant  to  impress  other very rich idiots and the ship suddenlydropped out of the sky like a stoneIt was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crewsustained  a  nasty  bruise  to  the  upper  arm  This should beemphasized because as had already  been  revealed  they  escapeotherwise  completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles donot eventually hit the ship The safety of the crew is absolutelyassuredImpact minus twenty seconds guys  said the computerThen turn the bloody engines back on bawled ZaphodOK sure thing guys said the computer With a subtle roar theengines  cut back in the ship smoothly flattened out of its diveand headed back towards the missiles againThe computer started to singWhen you walk through the storm  it  whined  nasally  holdyour head up high Zaphod screamed at it to shut up but his voice was lost  in  thedin   of  what  they  quite  naturally  assumed  was  approachingdestructionAnd dont  be afraid  of the dark Eddie wailedThe ship in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside downand  lying  on  the  ceiling  as  they  were  it  was now totallyimpossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systemsAt the end of the storm  crooned EddieThe  two  missiles  loomed  massively  on  the  screens  as  theythundered towards the ship is a golden sky But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they  had  not  yet  fullycorrected  their  flight paths to that of the erratically weavingship and they passed right under itAnd the sweet silver songs of the lark  Revised  impact  timefifteen seconds fellas  Walk on through the wind The missiles banked round in a screeching arc  and  plunged  backinto pursuitThis is it said  Arthur  watching  them  We  are  now  quitedefinitely going to die arent weI wish youd stop saying that shouted FordWell we are arent weYesWalk on through the rain  sang EddieA thought struck Arthur He struggled to his feetWhy doesnt anyone turn on this Improbability Drive  thing  hesaid We could probably reach thatWhat are you crazy said Zaphod  Without  proper  programminganything could happenDoes that matter at this stage shouted ArthurThough your dreams be tossed and blown  sand EddieArthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky piecesof  moulded  contouring  where  the  curve  of  the  wall met theceilingWalk on walk on with hope in your heart Does anyone know why Arthur  cant  turn  on  the  ImprobabilityDrive shouted TrillianAnd youll never walk alone  Impact minus five seconds  itsbeen  great knowing you guys God bless  Youll ne  ver walk  aloneI said yelled Trillian does anyone know The next thing that happened  was  a  midmangling  explosion  ofnoise and lightAnd the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart ofGold  continued  on  its  way  perfectly  normally  with a ratherfetchingly redesigned interior It was somewhat larger and  doneout  in delicate pastel shades of green and blue In the centre aspiral staircase leading nowhere in particular stood in a sprayof  ferns  and  yellow  flowers  and  next  to it a stone sundialpedestal housed the main computer  terminal  Cunningly  deployedlighting  and  mirrors  created  the  illusion  of  standing in aconservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely  manicuredgarden  Around  the  periphery  of  the  conservatory area stoodmarbletopped tables on intricately beautiful wroughtiron  legsAs  you  gazed  into the polished surface of the marble the vagueforms of instruments became visible and as you touched them  theinstruments  materialized  instantly  under your hands Looked atfrom the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect  all  therequired  data  readouts though it was far from clear where theywere reflected from It was in fact sensationally beautifulRelaxing in a wickerwork sun chair Zaphod Beeblebrox said Whatthe hell happenedWell I was just saying said Arthur lounging by  a  small  fishpool  theres this Improbability Drive switch over here  hewaved at where it had been There was a potted plant there nowBut where are we said Ford  who  was  sitting  on  the  spiralstaircase  a  nicely  chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in hishandExactly where we were I think  said Trillian as all  aboutthem  the  mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscapeof Magrathea which still scooted along beneath themZaphod leapt out of his seatThen whats happened to the missiles he saidA new and astounding image appeared in the mirrorsThey would appear said Ford doubtfully to have turned into abowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale At an Improbability Factor cut in Eddie who hadnt changed  abit of eight million seven hundred and sixtyseven thousand onehundred and twentyeight to one againstZaphod stared at ArthurDid you think of that Earthman he demandedWell said Arthur all I did was Thats very good thinking you know Turn  on  the  ImprobabilityDrive for a second without first activating the proofing screensHey kid you just saved our lives you know thatOh said Arthur well it was nothing really Was it said Zaphod Oh well forget it  then  OK  computertake us in to landBut I said forget itAnother thing that got forgotten was the fact  that  against  allprobability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existenceseveral miles above the surface of an alien planetAnd since this is not a naturally tenable position for  a  whalethis poor innocent creature had very little time to come to termswith its identity as a whale before it then had to come to  termswith not being a whale any moreThis is a complete record of its  thoughts  from  the  moment  itbegan its life till the moment it ended itAh   Whats happening it thoughtEr excuse me who am IHelloWhy am I here Whats my purpose in lifeWhat do I mean by who am ICalm down get  a  grip  now    oh  this  is  an  interestingsensation  what  is  it  Its  a  sort of  yawning tinglingsensation in my  my    well  I  suppose  Id  better  startfinding  names  for  things if I want to make any headway in whatfor the sake of what I shall call an argument I  shall  call  theworld so lets call it my stomachGood Ooooh its getting quite strong  And  hey  whats  aboutthis  whistling  roaring sound going past what Im suddenly goingto call my head Perhaps I can call that  wind Is that a goodname  Itll do  perhaps I can find a better name for it laterwhen Ive found out what its for  It  must  be  something  veryimportant  because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot ofit Hey Whats this thing This  lets call it a tail  yeahtail  Hey I can can really thrash it about pretty good cant IWow Wow That feels great Doesnt seem to achieve very much butIll probably find out what its for later on Now  have I builtup any coherent picture of things yetNo Never mind hey this is really exciting so  much  to  find  outabout  so  much  to  look  forward  to  Im  quite  dizzy  withanticipation  hspacecm Or is it the windThere really is a lot of that now isnt itAnd wow Hey Whats this thing suddenly coming towards  me  veryfast  Very  very fast So big and flat and round it needs a bigwide sounding name like  ow  ound    round    groundThats it Thats a good name  groundI wonder if it will be friends with meAnd the rest after a sudden wet thud was silenceCuriously enough the only thing that went through  the  mind  ofthe bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no not again Many peoplehave speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of  petuniashad thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of theuniverse than we do nowAre we taking this robot  with  us  said  Ford  looking  withdistaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posturein the corner under a small palm treeZaphod glanced away from the mirror  screens  which  presented  apanoramic  view  of  the blighted landscape on which the Heart ofGold had now landedOh the Paranoid Android he said Yeah well take himBut what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robotYou think youve  got  problems  said  Marvin  as  if  he  wasaddressing  a newly occupied coffin what are you supposed to doif you are a manically  depressed  robot  No  dont  bother  toanswer  that  Im fifty thousand times more intelligent than youand even I dont know the answer It gives  me  a  headache  justtrying to think down to your levelTrillian burst in through the door from her cabinMy white mice have escaped she saidAn expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either ofZaphods facesNuts to your white mice he saidTrillian glared an upset glare at him and disappeared againIt is possible that  her  remark  would  have  commanded  greaterattention  had  it been generally realized that human beings wereonly the third most intelligent life form present on  the  planetEarth  instead  of as was generally thought by most independentobservers the secondGood afternoon boysThe voice was oddly familiar  but  oddly  different  It  had  amatriarchal  twang  It  announced  itself  to  the  crew as theyarrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them  out  on  theplanet surfaceThey looked at each other in puzzlementIts the computer explained Zaphod I discovered  it  had  anemergency  backup  personality  that  I  thought  might work outbetterNow this is going to be your first day  out  on  a  strange  newplanet  continued Eddies new voice so I want you all wrappedup snug and warm  and  no  playing  with  any  naughty  bugeyedmonstersZaphod tapped impatiently on the hatchIm sorry he said I think we might  be  better  off  with  aslide ruleRight snapped the computer Who said thatWill you open the exit  hatch  please  computer  said  Zaphodtrying not to get angryNot until whoever  said  that  owns  up  urged  the  computerstamping a few synapses closedOh God muttered Ford slumped against a bulkhead  and  startedto  count  to  ten  He  was  desperately  worried  that  one daysentinent life forms  would  forget  how  to  do  this  Only  bycounting   could   humans   demonstrate   their  independence  ofcomputersCome on said Eddie sternlyComputer  began Zaphod Im  waiting  interrupted  Eddie  I  can  wait  all  day  ifnecessary Computer  said Zaphod again who had been trying to think ofsome subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with andhad decided not to bother competing with it on  its  own  groundif  you  dont  open  that  exit  hatch  this moment I shall zapstraight off to your major data banks and reprogram  you  with  avery large axe got thatEddie shocked paused and considered thisFord  carried  on  counting  quietly  This  is  about  the  mostaggressive  thing  you  can  do  to a computer the equivalent ofgoing up to a human being and saying Blood   blood    blood blood Finally Eddie said quietly  I  can  see  this  relationship  issomething  were  all going to have to work at and the hatchwayopenedAn icy wind ripped into them they hugged themselves  warmly  andstepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of MagratheaItll all end in tears I know it shouted Eddie after them andclosed the hatchway againA few minutes later he opened and closed the  hatchway  again  inresponse to a command that caught him entirely by surpriseFive figures wandered slowly over the blighted land Bits  of  itwere  dullish  grey  bits  of  it  dullish brown the rest of itrather less interesting to look  at  It  was  like  a  driedoutmarsh  now  barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer ofdust about an inch thick It was very coldZaphod was clearly rather depressed about it He stalked  off  byhimself  and  was  soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in thegroundThe wind stung Arthurs eyes and ears and  the  stale  thin  airclasped his throat However the thing stung most was his mindIts fantastic  he said and his own voice rattled his earsSound carried badly in this thin atmosphereDesolate hole if you ask me said Ford I could have more  funin  a  cat  litter  He  felt  a mounting irritation Of all theplanets in all the star systems of all the  Galaxy    didnt  hejust  have  to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years ofbeing a castaway Not even  a  hot  dog  stand  in  evidence  Hestooped  down  and  picked up a cold clot of earth but there wasnothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of light years  tolook atNo insisted Arthur dont you understand this is  the  firsttime  Ive  actually stood on the surface of another planet  awhole alien world  Pity its such a dump thoughTrillian hugged herself shivered and  frowned  She  could  havesworn  she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the cornerof her eye but when she glanced in that direction all she  couldsee  was the ship still and silent a hundred yards or so behindthemShe was relieved when a second or so later they caught  sight  ofZaphod  standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to themto come and join himHe seemed to be excited but they couldnt clearly hear  what  hewas saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the windAs they approached the ridge of higher ground they  became  awarethat  it  seemed  to  be  circular  a crater about a hundred andfifty yards wide Round the outside of  the  crater  the  slopingground  was  spattered with black and red lumps They stopped andlooked at a piece It was wet It was rubberyWith horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeatAt the top of the craters lip they met ZaphodLook he said pointing into the craterIn the centre lay the exploded carcass of a  lonely  sperm  whalethat  hadnt  lived  long enough to be disappointed with its lotThe silence was only disturbed by the slight  involuntary  spasmsof Trillians throatI suppose theres no point  in  trying  to  bury  it  murmuredArthur and then wished he hadntCome said Zaphod and started back down into the craterWhat down there said Trillian with severe distasteYeah said Zaphod come on Ive got something to show youWe can see it said TrillianNot that said Zaphod something else Come onThey all hesitatedCome on insisted Zaphod Ive found a way inIn said Arthur in horrorInto the interior of the planet  An  underground  passage  Theforce  of the whales impact cracked it open and thats where wehave to go Where no man has trod these five million years  intothe very depths of time itself Marvin started his ironical humming againZaphod hit him and he shut upWith little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down theincline  into  the  crater  trying  very hard not to look at itsunfortunate creatorLife said Marvin dolefully loathe it or ignore it you cantlike itThe ground had caved in where the whale had hit  it  revealing  anetwork  of  galleries  and  passages  now largely obstructed bycollapsed rubble and entrails Zaphod had made a start clearing away into one of them but Marvin was able to do it rather fasterDank air wafted out of its dark recesses and as Zaphod  shone  atorch into it little was visible in the dusty gloomAccording to the legends he said the Magratheans lived  mostof their lives undergroundWhys that said Arthur Did the surface become  too  pollutedor overpopulatedNo I dont think so said Zaphod I think  they  just  didntlike it very muchAre you sure you know what youre doing said Trillian  peeringnervously  into  the  darkness Weve been attacked once alreadyyou knowLook kid I promise you the live population of  this  planet  isnil  plus  the four of us so come on lets get on in there Erhey Earthman Arthur said ArthurYeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you  and  guardthis end of the passageway OKGuard said Arthur What from You just said  theres  no  onehereYeah well just for safety OK said ZaphodWhose Yours or mineGood lad OK here we goZaphod scrambled down into the passage followed by Trillian  andFordWell I hope you all have a really  miserable  time  complainedArthurDont worry Marvin assured him they willIn a few seconds they had disappeared from viewArthur stamped around in a huff and then decided that a  whalesgraveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around inMarvin eyed him balefully for a moment and then  turned  himselfoffZaphod marched quickly down the passageway nervous as hell  buttrying  to  hide  it by striding purposefully He flung the torchbeam around The walls were covered in dark tiles and  were  coldto the touch the air thick with decayThere what did I tell you  he  said  An  inhabited  planetMagrathea  and  he  strode  on through the dirt and debris thatlittered the tile floorTrillian was reminded  unavoidably  of  the  London  Undergroundthough it was less thoroughly squalidAt intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large  mosaics simple angular patterns in bright colours Trillian stopped andstudied one of them but could not interpret any  sense  in  themShe called to ZaphodHey have you any idea what these strange symbols areI think theyre just strange symbols of some kind said Zaphodhardly glancing backTrillian shrugged and hurried after himFrom time to time a doorway led either to the left or right  intosmallish  chambers  which  Ford discovered to be full of derelictcomputer equipment He dragged Zaphod into one to  have  a  lookTrillian followedLook said Ford you reckon this is Magrathea Yeah said Zaphod and we heard the voice rightOK so Ive bought the  fact  that  its  Magrathea    for  themoment  What  you  have  so far said nothing about is how in theGalaxy you found it You didnt just look it up in a star  atlasthats for sureResearch  Government  archives  Detective  work   Few   luckyguesses EasyAnd then you stole the Heart of Gold to come  and  look  for  itwithI stole it to look for a lot of thingsA lot of things said Ford in surprise Like whatI dont knowWhatI dont know what Im looking forWhy notBecause  because  I think it might be because if I knew  Iwouldnt be able to look for themWhat are you crazyIts a  possibility  I  havent  ruled  out  yet  said  Zaphodquietly  I  only  know as much about myself as my mind can workout under its current conditions And its current conditions  arenot goodFor a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod witha mind suddenly full of worryListen old friend if you want to  started Ford eventuallyNo wait  Ill tell you something said Zaphod I freewheela lot I get an idea to do something and hey why not I do itI reckon Ill  become  President  of  the  Galaxy  and  it  justhappens its easy I decide to steal this ship I decide to lookfor Magrathea and it all just happens Yeah I work out  how  itcan  best  be  done  right  but  it always works out Its likehaving a Galacticredit card which keeps  on  working  though  younever  send off the cheques And then whenever I stop and think why did I want to do something  how did I work out  how  to  doit   I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about itLike I have now Its a big effort to talk about itZaphod paused for a while For a while there was silence Then hefrowned  and  said  Last night I was worrying about this againAbout the fact that part of my mind  just  didnt  seem  to  workproperly  Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was thatsomeone else was using my mind to have good ideas  with  withouttelling  me  about  it  I put the two ideas together and decidedthat maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for  thatpurpose which was why I couldnt use it I wondered if there wasa way I could checkI went to the ships medical bay and  plugged  myself  into  theencephelographic  screen  I  went  through every major screeningtest on both my heads  all the tests I had to go  through  undergovernment  medical  officers before my nomination for Presidencycould be properly  ratified  They  showed  up  nothing  Nothingunexpected  at least They showed that I was clever imaginativeirresponsible untrustworthy  extrovert  nothing  you  couldnthave  guessed  And  no  other  anomalies So I started inventingfurther tests  completely  at  random  Nothing  Then  I  triedsuperimposing  the  results  from  one head on top of the resultsfrom the other head Still nothing Finally I got silly  becauseId  given  it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoiaLast thing I did before I packed it in was take the  superimposedpicture and look at it through a green filter You remember I wasalways superstitious about the color green when I was  a  kid  Ialways wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scoutsFord noddedAnd there it was said Zaphod clear as day A  whole  sectionin  the middle of both brains that related only to each other andnot to anything else around them Some bastard had cauterized allthe  synapses  and  electronically traumatised those two lumps ofcerebellumFord stared at him aghast Trillian had turned whiteSomebody did that to you whispered FordYeahBut have you any idea who Or whyWhy I can only guess But I do know who the bastard wasYou know How do you knowBecause they left  their  initials  burnt  into  the  cauterizedsynapses They left them there for me to seeFord stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawlInitials Burnt into your brainYeahWell what were they for Gods sakeZaphod looked at him in silence  again  for  a  moment  Then  helooked awayZB he saidAt that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them  and  gasstarted to pour into the chamberIll tell you about it later choked Zaphod as all three passedoutOn the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodilyFord had thoughtfully left him his  copy  of  The  Hitch  HikersGuide  to the Galaxy to while away the time with He pushed a fewbuttons at randomThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a very  unevenly  editedbook and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editorslike a good idea at the timeOne of these the one Arthur now came across supposedly  relatesthe  experiences  of  one Veet Voojagig a quiet young student atthe University of Maximegalon who pursued a  brilliant  academiccareer  studying  ancient  philology transformational ethics andthe wave harmonic theory  of  historical  perception  and  thenafter  a  night  of  drinking  Pan  Galactic Gargle Blasters withZaphod Beeblebrox became increasingly obsessed with the  problemof  what  had happened to all the biros hed bought over the pastfew yearsThere followed a long period of painstaking research during whichhe  visited  all  the  major  centres of biro loss throughout thegalaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little  theory  whichquite caught the public imagination at the time Somewhere in thecosmos  he  said  along  with  all  the  planets  inhabited  byhumanoids    reptiloids    fishoids   walking   treeoids   andsuperintelligent shades of the colour  blue  there  was  also  aplanet entirely given over to biro life forms And it was to thisplanet that unattended biros would make their way slipping  awayquietly  through  wormholes  in  space to a world where they knewthey could enjoy  a  uniquely  biroid  lifestyle  responding  tohighly  birooriented  stimuli  and  generally  leading the biroequivalent of the good lifeAnd as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until VeetVoojagig  suddenly claimed to have found this planet and to haveworked there for a while driving a  limousine  for  a  family  ofcheap green retractables whereupon he was taken away locked upwrote a book and was finally sent into tax exile which  is  theusual  fate  reserved for those who are determined to make a foolof themselves in publicWhen one day an expedition was sent to  the  spatial  coordinatesthat  Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only asmall asteroid inhabited  by  a  solitary  old  man  who  claimedrepeatedly  that nothing was true though he was later discoveredto be lyingThere did however remain the question of  both  the  mysterious  Altairan  dollars  paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bankaccount and of  course  Zaphod  Beeblebroxs  highly  profitablesecondhand biro businessArthur read this and put the book downThe robot still sat there completely inertArthur got up and walked to the top  of  the  crater  He  walkedaround  the  crater  He  watched two suns set magnificently overMagratheaHe went back down into the crater He woke the robot  up  becauseeven  a  manically  depressed  robot  is  better  to talk to thannobodyNights falling he said Look robot  the  stars  are  comingoutFrom the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to  see  very  fewstars and only very faintly but they were there to be seenThe robot obediently looked at them then looked backI know he said Wretched isnt itBut that sunset Ive never seen anything like it in my  wildestdreams    the  two suns It was like mountains of fire boilinginto spaceIve seen it said Marvin Its rubbishWe only ever had the one sun at  home  persevered  Arthur  Icame from a planet called Earth you knowI know said Marvin you keep going on  about  it  It  soundsawfulAh no it was a beautiful placeDid it have oceansOh yes said Arthur with  a  sigh  great  wide  rolling  blueoceans Cant bear oceans said MarvinTell me inquired Arthur  do  you  get  on  well  with  otherrobotsHate them said Marvin Where are you goingArthur couldnt bear any more He had got up againI think Ill just take another walk he saidDont blame you said  Marvin  and  counted  five  hundred  andninetyseven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again asecond laterArthur slapped  his  arms  about  himself  to  try  and  get  hiscirculation  a little more enthusiastic about its job He trudgedback up the wall of the craterBecause the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moonnightfall  was very rapid and it was by now very dark Because ofthis Arthur practically  walked  into  the  old  man  before  henoticed himHe was standing with his back to Arthur watching  the  very  lastglimmers  of light sink into blackness behind the horizon He wastallish elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe When  heturned  his  face  was  thin  and distinguished careworn but notunkind the sort of face you would  happily  bank  with  But  hedidnt turn yet not even to react to Arthurs yelp of surpriseEventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely  andhe  turned  His  face  was still illuminated from somewhere andwhen Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a  fewyards away stood a small craft of some kind  a small hovercraftArthur guessed It shed a dim pool of light around itThe man looked at Arthur sadly it seemedYou choose a cold night to visit our dead planet he saidWho  who are you stammered ArthurThe man looked away Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross  hisfaceMy name is not important he saidHe seemed to have something on his mind Conversation was clearlysomething he felt he didnt have to rush at Arthur felt awkwardI  er  you startled me  he said lamelyThe man looked  round  to  him  again  and  slightly  raised  hiseyebrowsHmmmm he saidI said you startled meDo not be alarmed I will not harm youArthur frowned at him But you shot at us There  were  missiles he saidThe man chuckled slightlyAn automatic system he said and gave a  small  sigh  Ancientcomputers  ranged  in the bowels of the planet tick away the darkmillennia and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data  banks  Ithink they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotonyHe looked gravely at Arthur and said Im a great fan of scienceyou knowOh  er really said Arthur who was beginning to  find  themans curious kindly manner disconcertingOh yes said the old man and simply stopped talking againAh said Arthur er  He had an odd felling of being like aman  in  the  act  of  adultery who is surprised when the womanshusband wanders into the room changes his trousers passes a fewidle remarks about the weather and leaves againYou seem ill at ease said the old man with polite concernEr no  well  yes  Actually  you  see  we  werent  reallyexpecting  to find anybody about in fact I sort of gathered thatyou were all dead or something Dead said the old man Good gracious no we have but sleptSlept said Arthur incredulouslyYes through the economic recession you see said the old  manapparently  unconcerned  about  whether  Arthur understood a wordhe was talking about or notEr economic recessionWell you see  five  million  years  ago  the  Galactic  economycollapsed and seeing that custommade planets are something of aluxury commodity you see He paused and looked at ArthurYou know we built planets do you he asked solemnlyWell yes said Arthur Id sort of gathered Fascinating trade said the old man and a  wistful  look  cameinto  his  eyes  doing  the coastlines was always my favouriteUsed to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords    soanyway  he said trying to find his thread again the recessioncame and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if  we  justslept  through  it  So  we programmed the computers to revive uswhen it was all overThe man stifled a very slight yawn and continuedThe computers were index linked to  the  Galactic  stock  marketprices  you  see so that wed all be revived when everybody elsehad rebuilt the economy enough to  afford  our  rather  expensiveservicesArthur a regular Guardian reader was deeply shocked at thisThats a pretty unpleasant way to behave isnt itIs it asked the old man mildly Im sorry Im a bit  out  oftouchHe pointed down into the craterIs that robot yours he saidNo came a thin metallic voice from the crater Im mineIf youd call it a robot muttered Arthur Its more a sort ofelectronic sulking machineBring it said the old man Arthur was quite surprised to  heara  note  of  decision suddenly present in the old mans voice Hecalled to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a  big  show  ofbeing lame which he wasntOn second thoughts said the old man leave it here You  mustcome  with  me  Great  things  are afoot He turned towards hiscraft which though  no  apparent  signal  had  been  given  nowdrifted quietly towards them through the darkArthur looked down at Marvin who now made an equally big show ofturning  round  laboriously and trudging off down into the crateragain muttering sour nothings to himselfCome called the old man come now or you will be lateLate said Arthur What forWhat is your name humanDent Arthur Dent said ArthurLate as in the late Dentarthurdent said the old man sternlyIts  a  sort of threat you see Another wistful look came intohis tired old eyes Ive never been very good  at  them  myselfbut Im told they can be very effectiveArthur blinked at himWhat an extraordinary person he muttered to himselfI beg your pardon said the old manOh nothing Im sorry said Arthur in embarrassment  Alrightwhere do we goIn my aircar said the old man motioning Arthur to get into thecraft which had settled silently next to them We are going deepinto the bowels of the planet where even now our  race  is  beingrevived from its fivemillionyear slumber Magrathea awakesArthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself  next  to  theold  man  The  strangeness of it the silent bobbing movement ofthe craft as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled himHe looked at the old man his face illuminated by the  dull  glowof tiny lights on the instrument panelExcuse me he said to him what is your name by the wayMy name said the old man and the same  distant  sadness  cameinto  his  face  again  He  paused  My name he said  isSlartibartfastArthur practically chokedI beg your pardon he splutteredSlartibartfast repeated the old man quietlySlartibartfastThe old man looked at him gravelyI said it wasnt important he saidThe aircar sailed through the nightIt is an important and popular fact that things  are  not  alwayswhat they seem For instance on the planet Earth man had alwaysassumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he hadachieved  so  much  the wheel New York wars and so on  whilstall the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water havinga  good  time  But  conversely the dolphins had always believedthat they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely  thesame reasonsCuriously enough the dolphins had long known  of  the  impendingdestruction  of  the  planet  Earth and had made many attempts toalert mankind of the danger but  most  of  their  communicationswere  misinterpreted  as  amusing  attempts to punch footballs orwhistle for tidbits so they eventually  gave  up  and  left  theEarth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrivedThe  last  ever  dolphin  message   was   misinterpreted   as   asurprisingly  sophisticated  attempt  to  do  a doublebackwardssomersault through a hoop whilst whistling  the  Star  SprangledBanner but in fact the message was this So long and thanks forall the fishIn fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligentthan  dolphins and they spent a lot of their time in behaviouralresearch laboratories running round inside wheels and  conductingfrighteningly  elegant  and  subtle  experiments on man The  fact  that  once  again man  completely misinterpreted  this  relationship was entirely according to these creatures plansSilently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness  a  singlesoft  glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magratheannight It sped swiftly Arthurs companion seemed sunk in his ownthoughts  and  when  Arthur  tried  on  a couple of occasions toengage him in conversation again he would simply reply by  askingif he was comfortable enough and then left it at thatArthur tried to gauge the speed at which  they  were  travellingbut  the  blackness  outside  was  absolute and he was denied anyreference points The sense of motion was so soft and  slight  hecould almost believe they were hardly moving at allThen a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and withinseconds  had  grown  so  much in size that Arthur realized it wastravelling towards them at a colossal speed and he tried to makeout  what  sort  of  craft  it might be He peered at it but wasunable to discern any clear shape and suddenly gasped  in  alarmas  the  aircraft  dipped  sharply  and  headed downwards in whatseemed certain to be a collision course Their relative  velocityseemed  unbelievable  and  Arthur had hardly time to draw breathbefore it was all over The next thing he was  aware  of  was  aninsane  silver  blur  that seemed to surround him He twisted hishead sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling  rapidlyin  the  distance behind them and it took him several seconds torealize what had happenedThey had plunged into a tunnel in the ground The colossal  speedhad  been  their  own  relative  to the glow of light which was astationary hole in the ground  the  mouth  of  the  tunnel  Theinsane  blur  of  silver was the circular wall of the tunnel downwhich they were shooting apparently at several hundred miles  anhourHe closed his eyes in terrorAfter a length of time which he made  no  attempt  to  judge  hesensed  a  slight  subsidence in their speed and some while laterbecame aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle haltHe opened his eyes again They were still in the  silver  tunnelthreading  and  weaving  their  way through what appeared to be acrisscross  warren  of  converging  tunnels  When  they  finallystopped  it  was  in  a  small  chamber  of curved steel Severaltunnels also had their terminus here and at the farther  end  ofthe  chamber  Arthur  could  see a large circle of dim irritatinglight It was irritating because it played tricks with the  eyesit was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or farit was Arthur guessed quite wrongly that  it  might  be  ultravioletSlartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur  with  his  solemn  oldeyesEarthman he said we are now deep in the heart of MagratheaHow did you know I was an Earthman demanded ArthurThese things will become clear to you said the old man gentlyat  least  he  added  with slight doubt in his voice clearerthan they are at the momentHe continued I should warn you that the chamber we are about topass  into  does  not  literally exist within our planet It is alittle too  large We are about to pass through a gateway intoa vast tract of hyperspace It may disturb youArthur made nervous noisesSlartibartfast  touched  a  button  and   added   not   entirelyreassuringly It scares the willies out of me Hold tightThe car shot forward straight  into  the  circle  of  light  andsuddenly  Arthur  had a fairly clear idea of what infinity lookedlikeIt wasnt infinity  in  fact  Infinity  itself  looks  flat  anduninteresting  Looking  up  into  the  night sky is looking intoinfinity      distance   is   incomprehensible   and   thereforemeaningless  The  chamber  into  which  the  aircar  emerged wasanything but infinite it was just very very big so that it gavethe impression of infinity far better than infinity itselfArthurs senses bobbed and span as travelling  at  the  immensespeed  he  knew  the aircar attained they climbed slowly throughthe open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed aninvisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind themThe wallThe wall defied the imagination  seduced it and defeated it Thewall  was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top bottom andsides passed away beyond the reach of sight The  mere  shock  ofvertigo could kill a manThe wall appeared perfectly flat It would take the finest  lasermeasuring  equipment  to detect that as it climbed apparently toinfinity as it dropped dizzily away as it planed out to  eitherside  it also curved It met itself again thirteen light secondsaway In other words the wall  formed  the  inside  of  a  hollowsphere a sphere over three million miles across and flooded withunimaginable lightWelcome said Slartibartfast as the tiny  speck  that  was  theaircar  travelling  now at three times the speed of sound creptimperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space welcome  hesaid to our factory floorArthur stared about him in a kind  of  wonderful  horror  Rangedaway  before  them  at distances he could neither judge nor evenguess  at  were  a  series  of  curious  suspensions   delicatetraceries  of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapesthat hung in the spaceThis said Slartibartfast  is  where  we  make  most  of  ourplanets you seeYou mean said Arthur trying to  form  the  words  you  meanyoure starting it all up again nowNo no good heavens no exclaimed the old man no the  Galaxyisnt  nearly  rich  enough  to  support  us  yet No weve beenawakened to perform just one extraordinary commission   for  very  special  clients from another dimension It may interest you there in the distance in front of usArthur followed the old mans finger till he was  able  to  pickout the floating structure he was pointing out It was indeed theonly one of  the  many  structures  that  betrayed  any  sign  ofactivity  about  it  though  this was more a sublimal impressionthan anything one could put ones finger onAt the  moment  however  a  flash  of  light  arced  through  thestructure  and  revealed  in  stark relief the patterns that wereformed on the dark sphere  within  Patterns  that  Arthur  knewrough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes ofwords part of the furniture of his mind For a  few  seconds  hesat  in  stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind andtried to find somewhere to settle down and make sensePart of his brain told him that he knew perfectly  well  what  hewas  looking  at  and  what the shapes represented whilst anotherquite sensibly refused to  countenance  the  idea  and  abdicatedresponsibility for any further thinking in that directionThe flash came again and this time there could be no doubtThe Earth  whispered ArthurWell  the  Earth  Mark  Two  in  fact   said   Slartibartfastcheery Were making a copy from our original blueprintsThere was a pauseAre you trying  to  tell  me  said  Arthur  slowly  and  withcontrol that you originally  made the EarthOh yes said Slartibartfast Did you ever go to a place   Ithink it was called NorwayNo said Arthur no I didntPity said Slartibartfast that was one of mine Won an  awardyou  know  Lovely  crinkly edges I was most upset to hear aboutits destructionYou were upsetYes Five minutes later and it wouldnt have mattered  so  muchIt was a quite shocking cockupHuh said ArthurThe mice were furiousThe mice were furiousOh yes said the old man mildlyYes well so I expect were  the  dogs  and  cats  and  duckbilledplatypuses but Ah but they hadnt paid for it you see had theyLook said Arthur would it save you a lot of time if  I  justgave up and went mad nowFor a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence Then  the  oldman tried patiently to explainEarthman the planet you lived on was  commissioned  paid  forand  run  by  mice  It  was  destroyed  five  minutes before thecompletion of the purpose for which it was built and  weve  gotto build another oneOnly one word registered with ArthurMice he saidIndeed EarthmanLook sorry  are we talking about the little white furry thingswith  the  cheese fixation and women standing on tables screamingin early sixties sit comsSlartibartfast coughed politelyEarthman he said it is sometimes hard to follow your mode ofspeech  Remember  I  have  been  asleep  inside  this  planet ofMagrathea for five million years and know little of  these  earlysixties  sit  coms  of  which you speak These creatures you callmice you see they are not quite as they appear They are merelythe  protrusion  into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pandimensional beings The whole business with the  cheese  and  thesqueaking is just a frontThe old man paused and with a sympathetic frown continuedTheyve been experimenting on you Im afraidArthur thought about  this  for  a  second  and  then  his  faceclearedAh no he said I see the source of the misunderstanding  nowNo  look  you  see  what  happened  was  that  we  used  to  doexperiments  on  them  They  were  often  used  in   behaviouralresearch Pavlov and all that sort of stuff So what happened washat the mice would be set all sorts of tests  learning  to  ringbells  run  around  mazes and things so that the whole nature ofthe learning process could be examined From our observations  oftheir  behaviour  we were able to learn all sorts of things aboutour own Arthurs voice tailed offSuch subtlety  said Slartibartfast one has to admire itWhat said ArthurHow better to disguise their real natures  and  how  better  toguide  your thinking Suddenly running down a maze the wrong wayeating the wrong bit of cheese unexpectedly   dropping  dead  ofmyxomatosis  if its finely calculated the cumulative effect isenormousHe paused for effectYou  see  Earthman  they  really   are   particularly   cleverhyperintelligent  pandimensional  beings Your planet and peoplehave formed the matrix of an  organic  computer  running  a  tenmillionyear research programme Let me tell you the whole story Itll take a little timeTime  said  Arthur  weakly  is  not  currently  one  of   myproblemsThere are of course many problems connected with life  of  whichsome  of  the  most  popular are Why are people born Why do theydie Why do they want to spend so much of  the  intervening  timewearing digital watchesMany many millions of years ago a race of  hyperintelligent  pandimensional  beings  whose  physical  manifestation in their ownpandimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own got so fedup  with  the  constant bickering about the meaning of life whichused to interrupt  their  favourite  pastime  of  Brockian  UltraCricket  a  curious  game which involved suddenly hitting peoplefor no readily apparent reason and then running away  that  theydecided to sit down and solve their problems once and for allAnd to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computerwhich  was  so  amazingly  intelligent  that even before the databanks had been connected up it had started from I think thereforeI  am  and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and incometax before anyone managed to turn it offIt was the size of a small cityIts main console was installed in a specially designed  executiveoffice   mounted   on  an  enormous  executive  desk  of  finestultramahagony  topped  with  rich  ultrared  leather  The   darkcarpeting   was  discreetly  sumptuous  exotic  pot  plants  andtastefully engraved prints of the principal computer  programmersand  their  families  were deployed liberally about the room andstately windows looked out upon a treelined public squareOn  the  day  of  the  Great  OnTurning  two   soberly   dressedprogrammers  with  brief  cases arrived and were shown discreetlyinto the office  They  were  aware  that  this  day  they  wouldrepresent  their  entire  race  in  its greatest moment but theyconducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselvesdeferentially  before the desk opened their brief cases and tookout their leatherbound notebooksTheir names were Lunkwill and FookFor a few moments they sat in  respectful  silence  then  afterexchanging  a quiet glance with Fook Lunkwill leaned forward andtouched a small black panelThe subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was  nowin  total  active mode After a pause it spoke to them in a voicerich resonant and deepIt said What is this great task for which I Deep Thought  thesecond  greatest  computer in the Universe of Time and Space havebeen called into existenceLunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise Your task O Computer  began FookNo wait a minute this isnt right  said  Lunkwill  worriedWe distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one everand were not making do  with  second  best  Deep  Thought  headdressed  the  computer  are you not as we designed you to bethe greatest most powerful computer in all timeI  described  myself  as  the  second  greatest  intoned  DeepThought and such I amAnother worried look passed between the two programmers Lunkwillcleared his throatThere must be some mistake he said are you  not  a  greatestcomputer  than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all theatoms in a star in a millisecondThe Milliard Gargantubrain said Deep Thought with  unconcealedcontempt A mere abacus  mention it notAnd are you  not  said  Fook  leaning  anxiously  forward  agreater  analyst  than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the SeventhGalaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the  trajectoryof  every  single  dust particle throughout a fiveweek DangrabadBeta sand blizzardA fiveweek sand blizzard said Deep  Thought  haughtily  Youask  this  of  me  who  have contemplated the very vectors of theatoms in the Big Bang itself Molest  me  not  with  this  pocketcalculator stuffThe two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence  for  a  momentThen Lunkwill leaned forward againBut are you not he said a more fiendish disputant  than  theGreat Hyperlobic OmniCognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus the Magic and IndefatigableThe Great Hyperlobic OmniCognate Neutron Wrangler  said  DeepThought thoroughly rolling the rs could talk all four legs offan Arcturan MegaDonkey  but only I could persuade it to go for awalk afterwardsThen what asked Fook is the problemThere is no problem said Deep Thought with magnificent ringingtones  I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universeof Space and TimeBut the second insisted Lunkwill Why do you keep saying  thesecond   Youre   surely  not  thinking  of  the  MulticorticoidPerspicutron Titan Muller are you Or  the  Pondermatic  Or  theContemptuous lights flashed across the computers consoleI spare not  a  single  unit  of  thought  on  these  cyberneticsimpletons he boomed I speak of none but the computer that isto come after meFook was losing  patience  He  pushed  his  notebook  aside  andmuttered I think this is getting needlessly messianicYou know nothing of future time pronounced Deep Thought  andyet  in  my  teeming  circuitry I can navigate the infinite deltastreams of future probability and see that  there  must  one  daycome  a  computer  whose  merest  operational parameters I am notworthy to calculate but which it will be my fate  eventually  todesignFook sighed heavily and glanced across to LunkwillCan we get on and ask the question he saidLunkwill motioned him to waitWhat computer is this of which you speak he askedI will speak of it no further in this present time  said  DeepThought  Now Ask what else of me you will that I may functionSpeakThey shrugged at each other Fook composed himselfO Deep Thought Computer he said the task  we  have  designedyou  to  perform  is this We want you to tell us  he paused the AnswerThe answer said Deep Thought The answer to whatLife urged FookThe Universe said LunkwillEverything they said in chorusDeep Thought paused for a moments reflectionTricky he said finallyBut can you do itAgain a significant pauseYes said Deep Thought I can do itThere is an answer said Fook with breathless excitementA simple answer added LunkwillYes said Deep Thought Life the  Universe  and  EverythingThere  is  an  answer  But he added Ill have to think aboutitA sudden commotion destroyed the moment the door flew  open  andtwo  angry  men  wearing the coarse fadedblue robes and belts ofthe Cruxwan University burst into the room thrusting  aside  theineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their wayWe demand  admission  shouted  the  younger  of  the  two  menelbowing a pretty young secretary in the throatCome on shouted the older one you cant  keep  us  out  Hepushed a junior programmer back through the doorWe demand that you cant keep us out bawled the  younger  onethough  he was now firmly inside the room and no further attemptswere being made to stop himWho are you said Lunkwill rising angrily from his seat Whatdo you wantI am Majikthise announced the older oneAnd I demand that I am Vroomfondel shouted the younger oneMajikthise turned on Vroomfondel Its  alright  he  explainedangrily you dont need to demand thatAlright bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby  desk  I  amVroomfondel and that is not a demand that is a solid fact Whatwe demand is solid factsNo we dont  exclaimed  Majikthise  in  irritation  That  isprecisely what we dont demandScarcely pausing  for  breath  Vroomfondel  shouted  We  dontdemand  solid  facts  What we demand is a total absence of solidfacts I demand that I may or may not be VroomfondelBut who the devil are you exclaimed an outraged FookWe said Majikthise are PhilosophersThough we may not be said Vroomfondel waving a warning  fingerat the programmersYes we are insisted Majikthise We are quite definitely  hereas  representatives  of  the  Amalgamated  Union of PhilosophersSages Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons and  we  want  thismachine off and we want it off nowWhats the problem said LunkwillIll tell you  what  the  problem  is  mate  said  Majikthisedemarcation thats the problemWe demand yelled Vroomfondel that demarcation may or may notbe the problemYou just let the machines get on with  the  adding  up  warnedMajikthise  and  well  take care of the eternal verities thankyou very much You want to check your legal position you do mateUnder  law  the  Quest  for  Ultimate  Truth is quite clearly theinalienable  prerogative of your  working  thinkers  Any  bloodymachine  goes  and  actually finds it and were straight out of ajob arent we I mean whats the use of our sitting up  half  thenight  arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machineonly goes and  gives  us  his  bleeding  phone  number  the  nextmorningThats right shouted Vroomfondel we demand  rigidly  definedareas of doubt and uncertaintySuddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the roomMight I make  an  observation  at  this  point  inquired  DeepThoughtWell go on strike yelled VroomfondelThats  right  agreed  Majikthise  Youll  have  a  nationalPhilosophers strike on your handsThe hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillarybass  driver  units  mounted  in  sedately  carved and varnishedcabinet speakers around the room cut in to give  Deep  Thoughtsvoice a little more powerAll I wanted  to  say  bellowed  the  computer  is  that  mycircuits  are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answerto the Ultimate Question of Life the Universe and Everything he  paused  and  satisfied  himself  that  he  now had everyonesattention before continuing more  quietly  but  the  programmewill take me a little while to runFook glanced impatiently at his watchHow long he saidSeven and a half million years said Deep ThoughtLunkwill and Fook blinked at each otherSeven and a half million years  they cried in chorusYes declaimed Deep Thought I said Id have  to  think  aboutit  didnt  I And it occurs to me that running a programme likethis is bound to create an enormous amount of  popular  publicityfor  the whole area of philosophy in general Everyones going tohave their own theories about what answer Im eventually to  comeup  with  and who better to capitalize on that media market thanyou yourself So long as you can keep disagreeing with each otherviolently  enough  and  slagging  each  other  off in the popularpress you can keep yourself on the gravy  train  for  life  Howdoes that soundThe two philosophers gaped at himBloody  hell  said  Majikthise  now  that  is  what  I  callthinking  Here Vroomfondel why do we never think of things likethatDunno said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper think  our  brainsmust be too highly trained MajikthiseSo saying they turned on their heels and walked out of the  doorand into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreamsYes very  salutary  said  Arthur  after  Slartibartfast  hadrelated  the  salient  points  of  the story to him but I dontunderstand what all this has got to do with the  Earth  and  miceand thingsThat is but the first half of the story Earthman said the  oldman  If  you  would  care to discover what happened seven and ahalf millions later on the great day of the Answer allow me  toinvite  you  to  my  study  where  you  can experience the eventsyourself on our SensOTape records That  is  unless  you  wouldcare  to  take  a  quick stroll on the surface of New Earth Itsonly half completed Im afraid  we havent even finished buryingthe  artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet then we havethe Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era  to  laydown and No thank you said Arthur it wouldnt be quite the sameNo said Slartibartfast it  wont  be  and  he  turned  theaircar round and headed back towards the mindnumbing wallSlartibartfasts study was a total mess like the results  of  anexplosion  in  a  public  library  The  old  man frowned as theystepped inTerribly unfortunate he said a diode  blew  in  one  of  thelifesupport  computers  When  we  tried  to revive our cleaningstaff we discovered theyd been dead for nearly  thirty  thousandyears  Whos  going to clear away the bodies thats what I wantto know Look why dont you sit yourself down over there and  letme plug you inHe gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had beenmade out of the rib cage of a stegosaurusIt was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus explained theold  man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from undertottering piles of paper  and  drawing  instruments  Here  hesaid  hold  these and passed a couple of stripped wire end toArthurThe instant he took hold of them a  bird  flew  straight  throughhimHe was suspended in midair and  totally  invisible  to  himselfBeneath him was a pretty treelined city square and all around itas far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airyspacious  design  but  somewhat  the  worse  for wear  many werecracked and stained with rain Today however the sun was shininga  fresh  breeze  danced  lightly  through the trees and the oddsensation  that  all  the  buildings  were  quietly  humming  wasprobably  caused  by the fact that the square and all the streetsaround it were thronged with cheerful excited people Somewhere aband  was playing brightly coloured flags were fluttering in thebreeze and the spirit of carnival was in the airArthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air  above  itall without so much as a body to his name but before he had timeto reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and  calledfor everyones attentionA man standing on a brightly dressed  dais  before  the  buildingwhich  clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd overa TannoyO people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought he  cried  outHonoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise the Greatestand Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe  has  ever  known The Time of Waiting is overWild cheers broke out amongst the  crowd  Flags  streamers  andwolf whistles sailed through the air The narrower streets lookedrather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and franticallywaving their legs in the airSeven and a half million years our  race  has  waited  for  thisGreat  and  Hopefully  Enlightening Day cried the cheer leaderThe Day of the AnswerHurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowdNever again cried the man never again will we wake up in themorning  and  think Who am I What is my purpose in life Does itreally cosmically speaking matter if I dont get up and  go  towork  For today we will finally learn once and for all the plainand simple answer to all these nagging little problems  of  Lifethe Universe and EverythingAs the crowd erupted once again  Arthur  found  himself  glidingthrough the air and down towards one of the large stately windowson the first floor of the building behind the dais from which thespeaker was addressing the crowdHe experienced a moments panic as  he  sailed  straight  throughtowards  the  window  which  passed when a second or so later hefound  he  had  gone  right  through  the  solid  glass   withoutapparently touching itNo one in the room remarked on his  peculiar  arrival  which  ishardly  surprising  as  he wasnt there He began to realize thatthe whole experience  was  merely  a  recorded  projection  whichknocked sixtrack seventymillimetre into a cocked hatThe room was much as Slartibartfast had described  it  In  sevenand  a  half  million  years  it  had  been well looked after andcleaned regularly every century or so The ultramahagony desk wasworn  at  the edges the carpet a little faded now but the largecomputer terminal sat in sparkling glory on  the  desks  leathertop as bright as if it had been constructed yesterdayTwo severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal andwaitedThe time is nearly upon us said one and Arthur was  surprisedto  see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the mansneck The word was Loonquawl and it flashed a  couple  of  timesand  the  disappeared again Before Arthur was able to assimilatethis the other man spoke and the word  Phouchg  appeared  by  hisneckSeventyfive thousand generations ago our  ancestors  set  thisprogram in motion the second man said and in all that time wewill be the first to hear the computer speakAn awesome prospect Phouchg agreed the first man and  Arthursuddenly   realized   that  he  was  watching  a  recording  withsubtitlesWe are the ones who will hear said Phouchg the answer to thegreat question of Life The Universe  said LoonquawlAnd Everything Shhh said Loonquawl with  a  slight  gesture  I  think  DeepThought is preparing to speakThere was a moments expectant pause whilst panels slowly came tolife  on  the  front  of  the  console Lights flashed on and offexperimentally and settled down into a  businesslike  pattern  Asoft low hum came from the communication channelGood morning said Deep Thought at lastEr  Good morning O Deep Thought said Loonquawl  nervouslydo you have  er that is An answer for you interrupted Deep Thought majestically YesI haveThe two men shivered with expectancy Their waiting had not  beenin vainThere really is one breathed PhouchgThere really is one confirmed Deep ThoughtTo Everything To the great Question of Life the  Universe  andEverythingYesBoth of the men had been trained for this moment their lives hadbeen  a  preparation  for  it they had been selected at birth asthose who would witness  the  answer  but  even  so  they  foundthemselves gasping and squirming like excited childrenAnd youre ready to give it to us urged LoonquawlI amNowNow said Deep ThoughtThey both licked their dry lipsThough I dont think added Deep Thought that youre going tolike itDoesnt matter said Phouchg We must know it NowNow inquired Deep ThoughtYes Now Alright said the computer and settled into silence again  Thetwo men fidgeted The tension was unbearableYoure really not going to like it observed Deep ThoughtTell usAlright said Deep Thought The Answer to the  Great  QuestionYes Of Life the Universe and Everything  said Deep ThoughtYes Is  said Deep Thought and pausedYes Is Yes Fortytwo said Deep Thought with infinite majesty and calmIt was a long time before anyone spokeOut of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea  of  tenseexpectant faces down in the square outsideWere going to get lynched arent we he whisperedIt was a tough assignment said Deep Thought mildlyFortytwo yelled Loonquawl Is that all youve  got  to  showfor seven and a half million years workI checked it very thoroughly  said  the  computer  and  thatquite  definitely is the answer I think the problem to be quitehonest with you is that youve never  actually  known  what  thequestion isBut it was the Great Question The Ultimate  Question  of  Lifethe Universe and Everything howled LoonquawlYes said Deep Thought with the air of one  who  suffers  foolsgladly but what actually is itA slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at thecomputer and then at each otherWell you know its just Everything  Everything  offeredPhouchg weaklyExactly said Deep Thought So  once  you  do  know  what  thequestion actually is youll know what the answer meansOh terrific muttered Phouchg flinging aside his  notebook  andwiping away a tiny tearLook alright alright said Loonquawl can  you  just  pleasetell us the QuestionThe Ultimate QuestionYesOf Life the Universe and EverythingYesDeep Thought pondered this for a momentTricky he saidBut can you do it cried LoonquawlDeep Thought pondered this for another long momentFinally No he said firmlyBoth men collapsed on to their chairs in despairBut Ill tell you who can said Deep ThoughtThey both looked up sharplyWho Tell usSuddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently  nonexistent  scalpbegin  to  crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorablyforward towards the console but it was only a dramatic  zoom  onthe part of whoever had made the recording he assumedI speak of none other than the computer that is  to  come  afterme  intoned  Deep  Thought  his voice regaining its accustomeddeclamatory  tones  A   computer   whose   merest   operationalparameters  I  am not worthy to calculate  and yet I will designit for you A computer which can calculate the  Question  to  theUltimate   Answer   a  computer  of  such  infinite  and  subtlecomplexity that organic  life  itself  shall  form  part  of  itsoperational  matrix  And  you yourselves shall take on new formsand go down into the computer to  navigate  its  tenmillionyearprogram  Yes  I shall design this computer for you And I shallname it also unto you And it shall be called  The EarthPhouchg gaped at Deep ThoughtWhat a dull name he said and great incisions appeared down thelength  of  his  body  Loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrificgashed from nowhere The Computer console blotched  and  crackedthe  walls  flickered  and  crumbled and the room crashed upwardsinto its own ceiling Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur  holding  the  twowiresEnd of the tape he explainedZaphod Wake upMmmmmwwwwwerrrrrHey come on wake upJust let me stick to what Im good at  yeah  muttered  Zaphodand rolled away from the voice back to sleepDo you want me to kick you said FordWould it give you a lot of pleasure said Zaphod blearilyNoNor me So whats the point Stop  bugging  me  Zaphod  curledhimself upHe got a double dose of the gas said Trillian looking down  athim two windpipesAnd stop talking said Zaphod  its  hard  enough  trying  tosleep  anyway  Whats  the matter with the ground Its all coldand hardIts gold said FordWith an amazingly  balletic  movement  Zaphod  was  standing  andscanning  the  horizon  because that was how far the gold groundstretched in every direction  perfectly  smooth  and  solid  Itgleamed  like    its  impossible  to say what it gleamed likebecause nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way thata planet of solid gold doesWho put all that there yelped Zaphod goggleeyedDont get excited said Ford its only a catalogueA whoA catalogue said Trillian an illusionHow can you say that cried Zaphod falling to  his  hands  andknees  and staring at the ground He poked it and prodded it withhis fingernail It was very heavy and very  slightly  soft    hecould  mark  it  with his fingernail It was very yellow and veryshiny and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it inthat  very  peculiar  and  special way that breath evaporates offsolid goldTrillian and I came round a while ago said Ford  We  shoutedand  yelled  till  somebody came and then carried on shouting andyelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogueto keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us This is allSensOTapeZaphod stared at him bitterlyAh shit he said you wake me up from my own  perfectly  gooddream to show me somebody elses He sat down in a huffWhats that series of valleys over there he saidHallmark said Ford We had a lookWe didnt wake you earlier said Trillian The last planet wasknee deep in fishFishSome people like the oddest thingsAnd before that said Ford we  had  platinum  Bit  dull  Wethought youd like to see this one thoughSeas of light glared at them in one  solid  blaze  wherever  theylookedVery pretty said Zaphod petulantlyIn the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared  It  flickeredand changed and when they looked around again so had the landAs with one voice they all went YuchThe sea was purple The beach they were on was composed  of  tinyyellow  and  green pebbles  presumably terribly precious stonesThe mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with redpeaks  Nearby  stood  a  solid  silver beach table with a frillymauve parasol and silver tasslesIn the sky a huge sign appeared replacing the catalogue  numberIt  said  Whatever  your tastes Magrathea can cater for you Weare not proudAnd five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the  sky  onparachutesIn a moment the scene vanished and  left  them  in  a  springtimemeadow full of cowsOw said Zaphod My brainsYou want to talk about it said FordYeah OK said Zaphod and all three sat down and  ignored  thescenes that came and went around themI figure this said Zaphod Whatever happened to  my  mind  Idid  it  And I did it in such a way that it wouldnt be detectedby the government screening tests And I wasnt to know  anythingabout it myself Pretty crazy rightThe other two nodded in agreementSo I reckon whats so secret that I cant let  anybody  know  Iknow  it  not  the Galactic Government not even myself And theanswer is I dont  know  Obviously  But  I  put  a  few  thingstogether  and  I can begin to guess When did I decide to run forPresident Shortly after the death of President Yooden Vranx Youremember Yooden FordYeah said Ford he was that guy we met when we were kids theArcturan  captain He was a gas He gave us conkers when you bustyour way into his megafreighter Said you were the  most  amazingkid hed ever metWhats all this said TrillianAncient history said Ford when  we  were  kids  together  onBetelgeuse The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of thebulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying  regionsThe  Betelgeuse  trading  scouts used to find the markets and theArcturans would supply them There was  a  lot  of  trouble  withspace  pirates  before they were wiped out in the Dordellis warsand the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantasticdefence  shields known to Galactic science They were real brutesof ships and huge In orbit round a planet  they  would  eclipsethe sunOne day young Zaphod here decides to raid  one  On  a  trijetscooter designed for stratosphere work a mere kid I mean forgetit it was crazier than a mad monkey I went along for  the  ridebecause  Id  got  some  very safe money on him not doing it anddidnt want him coming back with fake evidence So what  happensWe  got  in  his  trijet  which  he had souped up into somethingtotally other crossed three parsecs in a matter of  weeks  bustour  way  into a megafreighter I still dont know how marched onto the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers  A  wilderthing  I have not known Lost me a years pocket money For whatConkersThe captain was this really amazing  guy  Yooden  Vranx  saidZaphod  He  gave us food booze  stuff from really weird partsof the Galaxy  lots of conkers of course and we  had  just  themost  incredible  time  Then  he  teleported  us  back Into themaximum security wing of Betelgeuse state prison He was  a  coolguy Went on to become President of the GalaxyZaphod pausedThe scene around them was  currently  plunged  into  gloom  Darkmists   swirled   round   them   and  elephantine  shapes  lurkedindistinctly in the shadows The air was occasionally  rent  withthe  sounds  of  illusory beings murdering other illusory beingsPresumably enough people must have liked this sort  of  thing  tomake it a paying propositionFord said Zaphod quietlyYeahJust before Yooden died he came to see meWhat You never told meNoWhat did he say What did he come to see you aboutHe told me about the Heart of Gold  It  was  his  idea  that  Ishould steal itHis ideaYeah said Zaphod and the only possible way  of  stealing  itwas to be at the launching ceremonyFord gaped at him in astonishment for a moment and  then  roaredwith laughterAre you telling me he said  that  you  set  yourself  up  tobecome President of the Galaxy just to steal that shipThats it said Zaphod with the sort of  grin  that  would  getmost people locked away in a room with soft wallsBut why said Ford Whats so important about having itDunno said Zaphod I think if Id consciously known what  wasso  important about it and what I would need it for it would haveshowed up on the brain screening tests and  I  would  never  havepassed  I  think  Yooden  told me a lot of things that are stilllocked awaySo you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain  asa result of Yooden talking to youHe was a hell of a talkerYeah but Zaphod old mate you want to look after  yourself  youknowZaphod shruggedI mean dont you have any inkling of the reasons for all thisasked FordZaphod thought hard about this and doubts  seemed  to  cross  hismindsNo he said at last I dont seem to be  letting  myself  intoany of my secrets Still he added on further reflection I canunderstand that I wouldnt trust myself  further  than  I  couldspit a ratA moment later the last planet in the  catalogue  vanished  frombeneath them and the solid world resolved itself againThey were sitting in a  plush  waiting  room  full  of  glasstoptables and design awardsA tall Magrathean man was standing in front of themThe mice will see you now he saidSo there you have it said Slartibartfast making a feeble  andperfunctory  attempt  to clear away some of the appalling mess ofhis study He picked up a paper from the top of a pile but  thencouldnt  think  of anywhere else to put it so he but it back ontop of the original pile which promptly fell over Deep  Thoughtdesigned the Earth we built it and you lived on itAnd the Vogons came and destroyed it  five  minutes  before  theprogram was completed added Arthur not unbitterlyYes said the old man pausing to  gaze  hopelessly  round  theroom  Ten  million  years  of  planning and work gone just likethat Ten million years Earthman  can you  conceive  of  thatkind  of  time  span  A  galactic civilization could grow from asingle worm five times over in that time Gone He pausedWell thats bureaucracy for you he addedYou know said Arthur thoughtfully all this explains a lot ofthings  All  through my life Ive had this strange unaccountablefeeling that something was going on in the world something  bigeven sinister and no one would tell me what it wasNo said the old man thats just perfectly  normal  paranoiaEveryone in the Universe has thatEveryone said Arthur Well if everyone has that  perhaps  itmeans  something  Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we knowMaybe Who cares said Slartibartfast  before  Arthur  got  tooexcited Perhaps Im old and tired he continued but I alwaysthink that the chances of finding out what really is going on areso  absurdly  remote that the only thing to do is to say hang thesense of it and just keep yourself occupied Look at me I designcoastlines I got an award for NorwayHe rummaged around in a pile of debris and  pulled  out  a  largeperspex  block  with his name on it and a model of Norway mouldedinto itWheres the sense in that he said None that Ive  been  ableto  make  out  Ive  been  doing  fjords  in  all my life For afleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major awardHe turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed  it  asidecarelessly  but  not  so  carelessly  that  it  didnt  land  onsomething softIn this replacement Earth were building theyve given me Africato  do and of course Im doing it with all fjords again because Ihappen to like them and Im old fashioned enough to  think  thatthey  give a lovely baroque feel to a continent And they tell meits not equatorial enough Equatorial He gave a hollow  laughWhat  does it matter Science has achieved some wonderful thingsof course but Id far rather be happy than right any dayAnd are youNo Thats where it all falls down of coursePity said Arthur with sympathy It sounded like quite a  goodlifestyle otherwiseSomewhere on the wall a small white light flashedCome said Slartibartfast you are  to  meet  the  mice  Yourarrival  on the planet has caused considerable excitement It hasalready been hailed so I gather as the  third  most  improbableevent in the history of the UniverseWhat were the first twoOh probably just coincidences said Slartibartfast carelesslyHe opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to followArthur glanced around him once more and then down at himself atthe sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in onThursday morningI seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle hemuttered to himselfI beg your pardon said the old man mildlyOh nothing said Arthur only jokingIt is of course well known that careless talk  costs  lives  butthe full scale of the problem is not always appreciatedFor instance at the very moment that Arthur said I seem  to  behaving tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle a freak wormholeopened up in the fabric of the spacetime continuum  and  carriedhis  words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches ofspace to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike  beings  werepoised on the brink of frightful interstellar battleThe two opposing leaders were meeting for the last timeA dreadful silence  fell  across  the  conference  table  as  thecommander  of  the  Vlhurgs  resplendent  in his black jewelledbattle shorts gazed levelly at the GGugvuntt  leader  squattingopposite  him in a cloud of green sweetsmelling steam and witha million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers  poised  tounleash  electric death at his single word of command challengedthe vile creature to take back what it had said about his motherThe creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour and  at  thatvery  moment  the words I seem to be having tremendous difficultywith my lifestyle drifted across the conference tableUnfortunately in the Vlhurg tongue this was the  most  dreadfulinsult  imaginable  and  there  was  nothing  for it but to wageterrible war for centuriesEventually of course after their Galaxy had been decimated  overa  few  thousand  years it was realized that the whole thing hadbeen a ghastly mistake and so the  two  opposing  battle  fleetssettled  their  few  remaining  differences  in order to launch ajoint attack on our own Galaxy  now positively identified as thesource of the offending remarkFor thousands more years the mighty ships tore across  the  emptywastes  of  space  and  finally  dived  screaming on to the firstplanet they came across  which happened to be the Earth   wheredue to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleetwas accidentally swallowed by a small dogThose who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in  thehistory  of  the Universe say that this sort of thing is going onall the time but that we are powerless to prevent itIts just life they sayA short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old  Magrathean  to  adoorway  They  left  the  car  and  went through the door into awaiting room full of  glasstopped  tables  and  perspex  awardsAlmost  immediately  a light flashed above the door at the otherside of the room and they enteredArthur Youre safe a voice criedAm I said Arthur rather startled Oh goodThe lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so tosee  Ford  Trillian  and  Zaphod  sitting  round  a  large tablebeautifully decked out with exotic dishes strange sweetmeats andbizarre fruits They were stuffing their facesWhat happened to you demanded ArthurWell said Zaphod attacking a boneful of grilled muscle  ourguests  here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and beinggenerally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to  makeit  up  to us Here he said hoiking out a lump of evil smellingmeat from a bowl have some Vegan Rhinos cutlet Its deliciousif you happen to like that sort of thingHosts said Arthur What hosts I dont see any A small voice said Welcome to lunch Earth creatureArthur glanced around and suddenly yelpedUgh he said There are mice on the tableThere was an awkward silence  as  everyone  looked  pointedly  atArthurHe was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked likewhisky  glasses  on  the  table He heard the silence and glancedaround at everyoneOh he said with sudden realization Oh Im sorry I  wasntquite prepared for Let me introduce you said  Trillian  Arthur  this  is  BenjimouseHi said one of the mice His whiskers stroked what  must  havebeen  a  touch  sensitive panel on the inside of the whiskyglasslike affair and it moved forward slightlyAnd this is Frankie mouseThe other mouse said Pleased to meet you and did likewiseArthur gapedBut arent they Yes said Trillian they are the mice I brought with  me  fromthe EarthShe looked him in the eye and  Arthur  thought  he  detected  thetiniest resigned shrugCould you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey  shesaidSlartibartfast coughed politelyEr excuse me he saidYes thank you Slartibartfast said Benji mouse  sharply  youmay goWhat Oh  er very well said the old  man  slightly  takenaback Ill just go and get on with some of my fjords thenAh well in fact that wont be necessary said  Frankie  mouseIt  looks  very much as if we wont be needing the new Earth anylonger He swivelled his pink little eyes Not now that we havefound  a native of the planet who was there seconds before it wasdestroyedWhat cried Slartibartfast aghast You cant mean that  Ivegot a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over AfricaWell perhaps you can take a  quick  skiing  holiday  before  youdismantle them said Frankie acidlySkiing holiday cried the old man Those glaciers are works ofart  Elegantly  sculptured  contours  soaring pinnacles of icedeep majestic ravines It would be sacrilege to go skiing on highartThank you Slartibartfast said  Benji  firmly  That  will  beallYes sir said the old man coldly thank you very  much  Wellgoodbye  Earthman  he said to Arthur hope the lifestyle comestogetherWith a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and  walkedsadly out of the roomArthur stared after him not knowing what to sayNow said Benji mouse to businessFord and Zaphod clinked their glasses togetherTo business they saidI beg your pardon said BenjiFord looked roundSorry I thought you were proposing a toast he saidThe  two  mice  scuttled  impatiently  around  in   their   glasstransports  Finally  they  composed  themselves and Benji movedforward to address ArthurNow Earth creature he said the situation we have in  effectis  this  We  have  as you know been more or less running yourplanet for the last ten million  years  in  order  to  find  thiswretched thing called the Ultimate QuestionWhy said Arthur sharplyNo  we already thought of that one said Frankie interruptingbut  it doesnt fit the answer Why  FortyTwo  you see itdoesnt workNo said Arthur I mean why have you been doing itOh I see said Frankie Well eventually just habit I  thinkto be brutally honest And this is more or less the point  weresick to the teeth with the whole thing and the prospect of doingit all over again on account of those whinnetridden Vogons quitefrankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies  you  know  what  Imean It was by the merest lucky chance that Benji and I finishedour particular job and left the planet early for a quick holidayand  have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the goodoffices of your friendsMagrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension put in BenjiSince when continued his murine colleague  we  have  had  anoffer  of  a quite enormously fat contract to do the D chat showand lecture circuit back in  our  own  dimensional  neck  of  thewoods and were very much inclined to take itI would wouldnt you Ford said Zaphod promptinglyOh yes said Ford jump at it like a shotArthur glanced at them wondering what all this  was  leading  uptoBut weve got to have a product you see said Frankie I  meanideally  we  still  need  the  Ultimate  Question in some form orotherZaphod leaned forward to ArthurYou see he said if theyre just sitting there in the  studiolooking  very  relaxed  and  you know just mentioning that theyhappen to know the Answer to Life the Universe  and  Everythingand  then  eventually  have to admit that in fact its Fortytwothen the shows probably quite short No followup you seeWe have to have something that sounds good said BenjiSomething that sounds  good  exclaimed  Arthur  An  UltimateQuestion that sounds good From a couple of miceThe mice bristledWell I mean yes idealism yes the dignity  of  pure  researchyes  the  pursuit  of  truth  in all its forms but there comes apoint Im afraid where you begin to suspect that if  theres  anyreal  truth  its  that the entire multidimensional infinity ofthe Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacsAnd  if  it  comes  to  a choice between spending yet another tenmillion years finding that out and on the other hand just takingthe  money  and  running  then  I  for  one  could  do  with theexercise said FrankieBut  started Arthur hopelesslyHey will you get this Earthman interrupted Zaphod You  area last generation product of that computer matrix right and youwere there right up to the moment your  planet  got  the  fingeryeahEr So  your  brain  was  an  organic  part   of   the   penultimateconfiguration  of  the  computer  programme  said  Ford ratherlucidly he thoughtRight said ZaphodWell said Arthur doubtfully He wasnt aware  of  ever  havingfelt  an organic part of anything He had always seen this as oneof his problemsIn other words said Benji steering his curious little vehicleright  over  to Arthur theres a good chance that the structureof the question is encoded in the structure of your brain  so wewant to buy it off youWhat the question said ArthurYes said Ford and TrillianFor lots of money said ZaphodNo no said Frankie its the brain we want to buyWhatI  thought  you   said   you   could   just   read   his   brainelectronically protested FordOh yes said Frankie but wed have to get it out first  Itsgot to be preparedTreated said BenjiDicedThank you shouted Arthur tipping up  his  chair  and  backingaway from the table in horrorIt could always be replaced said  Benji  reasonably  if  youthink its importantYes an electronic brain said Frankie  a  simple  one  wouldsufficeA simple one wailed ArthurYeah said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin youd just have  toprogram  it  to  say What and I dont understand and Wheres thetea  whod know the differenceWhat cried Arthur backing away still furtherSee what I mean said Zaphod and howled with  pain  because  ofsomething that Trillian did at that momentId notice the difference said ArthurNo you wouldnt said Frankie mouse youd be  programmed  nottoFord made for the doorLook Im sorry mice old lads he said I dont  think  wevegot a dealI rather think we have to have a deal said the mice in chorusall  the  charm  vanishing  fro  their piping little voices in aninstant With a tiny whining shriek their  two  glass  transportslifted  themselves  off  the  table  and  swung  through the airtowards Arthur who  stumbled  further  backwards  into  a  blindcorner utterly unable to cope or think of anythingTrillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag himtowards  the door which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to openbut Arthur was dead weight  he seemed hypnotized by the airbornerodents swooping towards himShe screamed at him but he just gapedWith one more yank Ford and Zaphod got the  door  open  On  theother  side  of  it  was a small pack of rather ugly men who theycould only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea Not only  werethey ugly themselves but the medical equipment they carried withthem was also far from pretty They chargedSo  Arthur was about to have his head  cut  open  Trillian  wasunable to help him and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set uponby several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed thanthey wereAll in all it was extremely fortunate that at that  moment  everyalarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting dinEmergency Emergency blared the klaxons throughout  MagratheaHostile  ship  has  landed on planet Armed intruders in sectionA Defence stations defence stationsThe two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glasstransports where they lay shattered on the floorDamnation muttered Frankie mouse  all  that  fuss  over  twopounds of Earthling brain He scuttled round and about his pinkeyes flashing his fine white coat bristling with staticThe only thing  we  can  do  now  said  Benji  crouching  andstroking his whiskers in thought is to try and fake a questioninvent one that will sound plausibleDifficult said Frankie He thought How about  Whats  yellowand dangerousBenji considered this for a momentNo no good he said Doesnt fit the answerThey sank into silence for a few secondsAlright said Benji What do you get if you  multiply  six  bysevenNo no too  literal  too  factual  said  Frankie  wouldntsustain the punters interestAgain they thoughtThen Frankie said Heres a thought How many roads must  a  manwalk downAh said Benji Aha now that does sound promising He rolledthe  phrase  around  a little Yes he said thats excellentSounds very  significant  without  actually  tying  you  down  tomeaning  anything  at  all  How many roads must a man walk downFortytwo Excellent excellent thatll fox em  Frankie  babywe are madeThey performed a scampering dance in their excitementNear them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who  had  beenhit about the head with some heavy design awardsHalf a mile away four figures pounded up a corridor looking  fora  way out They emerged into a wide openplan computer bay Theyglanced about wildlyWhich way do you reckon Zaphod said FordAt a wild guess Id say down here said  Zaphod  running  offdown  to  the  right between a computer bank and the wall As theothers started after him he was brought up short by a  KillOZapenergy  bolt  that cracked through the air inches in front of himand fried a small section of adjacent wallA voice on a loud hailer said  OK  Beeblebrox  hold  it  rightthere Weve got you coveredCops hissed Zaphod and span around in a crouch You want  totry a guess at all FordOK this way said Ford and  the  four  of  them  ran  down  agangway between two computer banksAt the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and  spacesuited figure waving a vicious KillOZap gunWe dont want to shoot you Beeblebrox shouted the figureSuits me fine shouted Zaphod back and dived down  a  wide  gapbetween two data process unitsThe others swerved in behind himThere are two of them said Trillian Were corneredThey squeezed  themselves  down  in  an  angle  between  a  largecomputer data bank and the wallThey held their breath and waitedSuddenly the air exploded with energy  bolts  as  both  the  copsopened fire on them simultaneouslyHey theyre shooting at us said Arthur crouching in a  tightball I thought they said they didnt want to do thatYeah I thought they said that agreed FordZaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous momentHey he said I thought you said you didnt want to shoot usand ducked againThey waitedAfter a moment a voice replied It isnt easy being a copWhat did he say whispered Ford in astonishmentHe said it isnt easy being a copWell surely thats his problem isnt itId have thought soFord shouted out Hey listen I think weve got enough  problemson  our  own  having  you  shooting  at us so if you could avoidlaying your problems on us as well I  think  wed  all  find  iteasier to copeAnother pause and then the loud hailer againNow see here guy said the voice on the loud  hailer  yourenot dealing with any dumb twobit triggerpumping morons with lowhairlines little piggy eyes and no conversation were a  coupleof  intelligent caring guys that youd probably quite like if youmet us socially I dont go around gratuitously  shooting  peopleand  then  bragging  about  it  afterwards in seedy spacerangersbars like some cops I could mention I go around shooting peoplegratuitously  and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours tomy girlfriendAnd I write novels chimed in the other cop Though I  haventhad  any  of  them  published yet so I better warn you Im in ameeeean moodFords eyes popped halfway out of their sockets Who  are  theseguys he saidDunno said Zaphod I think I  preferred  it  when  they  wereshootingSo are you going to come  quietly  shouted  one  of  the  copsagain or are you going to let us blast you outWhich would you prefer shouted FordA millisecond later the air about them started to fry  again  asbolt  after  bolt  of  KillOZap hurled itself into the computerbank in front of themThe  fusillade  continued  for  several  seconds  at   unbearableintensityWhen it stopped there were a few seconds of  near  quietness  adthe echoes died awayYou still there called one of the copsYes they called backWe didnt enjoy doing that at all shouted the other copWe could tell shouted FordNow listen to this Beeblebrox and you better listen goodWhy shouted Back ZaphodBecause shouted the cop its going to be  very  intelligentand  quite  interesting  and  humane  Now  either  you  all giveyourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit though  not  verymuch  of  course  because  we  are  firmly  opposed  to  needlessviolence or we blow up this entire planet and  possibly  one  ortwo others we noticed on our way out hereBut thats crazy cried Trillian You wouldnt do thatOh yes we would shouted the cop wouldnt we he  asked  theother oneOh yes wed have to no question the other one called backBut why demanded TrillianBecause there are some things you have to do even if you are  anenlightened  liberal  cop  who  knows  all  about sensitivity andeverythingI just dont believe these guys  muttered  Ford  shaking  hisheadOne cop shouted to the other Shall we shoot them  again  for  abitYeah why notThey let fly another electric barrageThe heat and noise was quite fantastic Slowly the computer bankwas  beginning  to  disintegrate The front had almost all meltedaway and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding  their  wayback towards where they were squatting They huddled further backand waited for the endBut the end never came at least not thenQuite suddenly  the  barrage  stopped  and  the  sudden  silenceafterwards  was  punctuated  by a couple of strangled gurgles andthudsThe four stared at each otherWhat happened said ArthurThey stopped said Zaphod with a shrugWhyDunno do you want to go and ask themNoThey waitedHello called out FordNo answerThats oddPerhaps its a trapThey havent the witWhat were those thudsDunnoThey waited for a few more secondsRight said Ford Im going to have a lookHe glanced round at the othersIs no one going to  say  No  you  cant  possibly  let  me  goinsteadThey all shook their headsOh well he said and stood upFor a moment nothing happenedThen after a second or so nothing  continued  to  happen  Fordpeered  through  the  thick  smoke  that was billowing out of theburning computerCautiously he stepped out into the openStill nothing happenedTwenty yards away he  could  dimly  see  through  the  smoke  thespacesuited  figure  of  one  of  the  cops  He  was lying in acrumpled heap on the ground Twenty yards in the other  directionlay the second man No one else was anywhere to be seenThis struck Ford as being extremely oddSlowly nervously he walked towards the first one The body  layreassuringly  still  as  he  approached  it and continued to liereassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on  theKillOZap gun that still dangled from its limp fingersHe reached down and picked it up meeting no resistanceThe cop was quite clearly deadA quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa    hewas  a  methanebreathing  life form dependent on his space suitfor survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of MagratheaThe tiny lifesupport system computer on  his  backpack  appearedunexpectedly to have blown upFord poked around  in  it  in  considerable  astonishment  Theseminiature suit computers usually had the full backup of the maincomputer back on the ship with which they were  directly  linkedthrough  the  subetha  Such  a  system  was  failsafe  in  allcircumstances other than total feedback  malfunction  which  wasunheard ofHe hurried over to the other prone figure  and  discovered  thatexactly the same impossible thing had happened to him presumablysimultaneouslyHe called  the  others  over  to  look  They  came  shared  hisastonishment but not his curiosityLets get shot out of this hole said Zaphod If whatever  Imsupposed  to be looking for is here I dont want it He grabbedthe  second  KillOZap  gun  blasted   a   perfectly   harmlessaccounting computer and rushed out into the corridor followed bythe others He very nearly blasted hell out  of  an  aircar  thatstood waiting for them a few yards awayThe aircar was empty but Arthur recognized it  as  belonging  toSlartibartfastIt had a note from him pinned to part of  its  sparse  instrumentpanel  The note had an arrow drawn on it pointing at one of thecontrolsIt said This is probably the best button to pressThe aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R  through  thesteel  tunnels  that  lead  out onto the appalling surface of theplanet which was now in the grip of  yet  another  drear  morningtwilight Ghastly grey lights congealed on the landR is a velocity measure defined as a reasonable speed of  travelthat  is  consistent  with health mental wellbeing and not beingmore than say five minutes  late  It  is  therefore  clearly  analmost  infinitely  variable  figure  according to circumstancessince the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as  anabsolute  but  also  with  awareness of the third factor Unlesshandled with tranquility this equation can result in considerablestress ulcers and even deathR is not a fixed velocity but it is clearly far too fastThe aircar flung  itself  through  the  air  at  R  and  abovedeposited  them  next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly onthe frozen ground like a bleached bone  and  then  precipitatelyhurled  itself  back  in  the  direction  whence  they  had comepresumably on important business of its ownShivering the four of them stood and looked at the shipBeside it stood another oneIt was  the  Blagulon  Kappa  policecraft  a  bulbous  sharklikeaffair slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilledletters of  varying  degrees  of  size  and  unfriendliness  Theletters  informed  anyone  who cared to read them as to where theship was from what section of the police it was assigned to andwhere the power feeds should be connectedIt seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent even  for  a  shipwhose  twoman  crew  was  at that moment lying asphyxicated in asmokefilled chamber several miles beneath the ground It is  oneof  those curious things that is impossible to explain or definebut one can sense when a ship is completely deadFord could sense it and found it most mysterious  a ship and twopolicemen   seemed  to  have  gone  spontaneously  dead  In  hisexperience the Universe simply didnt work like thatThe other three could sense it too  but  they  could  sense  thebitter  cold  even  more  and hurried back into the Heart of Goldsuffering from an acute attack of no curiosityFord stayed and went to examine the Blagulon ship As he walkedhe  nearly  tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down inthe cold dustMarvin he exclaimed What are you doingDont feel you have to take any notice of me  please  came  amuffled droneBut how are you metalman said FordVery depressedWhats upI dont know said

finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother Of course she did This is the day of the reaping I prop myself up on one elbow Theres enough light in the bedroom to see them My little sister Prim curled up on her side cocooned in my mothers body their cheeks pressed together In sleep my mother looks younger still worn but not so beatendown Prims face is as fresh as a raindrop as lovely as the primrose for which she was named My mother was very beautiful once too Or sothey tell me Sitting at Prims knees guarding her is the worlds ugliest cat Mashedin nose half of one ear missing eyes the color of rotting squash Prim named him Buttercup insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower I he hates me Or at least distrusts me Even though it was years ago I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home Scrawny kitten belly swollen with worms crawling with fleas The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed But Prim begged so hard cried even I had to let him stay It turned out okay My mother got rid of the vermin and hes a born mouser Even catches the occasional rat Sometimes when I clean a kill I feed Buttercup the entrails He has stopped hissing at me Entrails No hissing This is the closest we will ever come to love I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots Supple leather that has molded to my feet I pull on trousers a shirt tuck my long dark braid up into a cap and grab my forage bag On the table under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves Prims gift to me on reaping day I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside Our part of District  nicknamed the Seam is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour Men and women with hunched shoulders swollen knuckles many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails the lines of their sunken faces But today the black cinder streets are empty Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed The reaping isnt until two May as well sleep in If you can Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow Separating the Meadow from the woods in fact enclosing all of District  is a high chainlink fence topped with barbedwire loops In theory its supposed to be electrified twentyfour hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods packs of wild dogs lone cougars bears that used to threaten our streets But since were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings itsusually safe to touch Even so I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live Right now its silent as a stone Concealed by a clump of bushes I flatten out on my belly and slide under a twofoot stretch thatsbeen loose for years There are several other weak spots in the fence but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here As soon as Im in the trees I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log Electrified or not the fence has been successful at keeping the flesheaters out of District  Inside the woods they roam freely and there are added concerns like venomous snakes rabid animals and no real paths to follow But theres also food if you know how to find it My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion There was nothing even to bury I was eleven then Five years later I still wake up screaming for him to run Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties more people would risk it if they had weapons But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife My bow is a rarity crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods carefully wrapped in waterproof covers My father could have made good money selling them but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is In fact theyre among our best customers But the idea that someone might be arming the Seam would never have been allowed In the fall a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples But always in sight of the Meadow Always close enough to run back to the safety of District  if trouble arises District Twelve Where you can starve to death in safety I mutter Then I glance quickly over my shoulder Even here even in the middle of nowhere you worry someone might overhear you When I was younger I scared my mother to death the things I would blurt out about District  about the people who rule our country Panem from the faroff city called the Capitol Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts Do my work quietly in school Make only polite small talk in the public market Discuss little more than trades in the Hob which is the black market where I make most of my money Even at home where I am less pleasant I avoid discussing tricky topics Like the reaping or food shortages or the Hunger Games Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself Gale I can feel themuscles in my face relaxing my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place a rock ledgeoverlooking a valley A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile Gale says I never smile except in the woods Hey Catnip says Gale My real name is Katniss but when I first told him I had barely whispered it So he thought Id said Catnip Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts it became his official nickname for me I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game I almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company But I got a decent price for his pelt Look what I shot Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it and I laugh Its real bakery bread not the flat dense loaves we make from our grain rations I take it in my hands pull out the arrow and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva Fine bread like this is for special occasions Mm still warm I say He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it What did it cost you Just a squirrel Think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning says Gale Even wished me luck Well we all feel a little closer today dont we I say not even bothering to roll my eyes Prim left us a cheese I pull it out His expression brightens at the treat Thank you Prim Well have a real feast Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping I almost forgot Happy Hunger Games He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us And may the odds He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue Be ever in your favor I finish with equal verve We have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits Besides the Capitol accent is so affected almost anything sounds funny in it I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread He could be my brother Straight black hair olive skin we even have the same gray eyes But were not related at least not closely Most of the families who work the mines resemble one another this way Thats why my mother and Prim with their light hair and blue eyes always look out of place They are My mothers parents were part of the small merchant class thatcaters to officials Peacekeepers and the occasional Seam customer They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District  Since almost no one can afford doctors apothecaries are our healers My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies She must have really loved him to leave her home for the Seam I try to remember that when all I can see is the woman who sat by blank and unreachable while her children turned to skin and bones Itry to forgive her for my fathers sake But to be honest Im not the forgiving type Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of their berries We settle back in a nook in the rocks From this place we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley which is teeming with summer life greens to gather roots to dig fish iridescent in the sunlight The day is glorious with a blue sky and soft breeze The foods wonderful with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale hunting for tonights supper But instead we have to be standing in the square at two oclock waiting for the names to be called out We could do it you know Gale says quietly What I ask Leave the district Run off Live in the woods You and I we could make it says Gale I dont know how to respond The idea is so preposterous If we didnt have so many kids he adds quickly Theyre not our kids of course But they might as well be Gales two little brothers and a sister Prim And you may as well throw in our mothers too because how would they live without us Who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more With both of us hunting daily there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling I never want to have kids I say I might If I didnt live here says Gale But you do I say irritated Forget it he snaps back The conversation feels all wrong Leave How could I leave Prim who is the only person in the world Im certain I love And Gale is devoted to his family We cant leave so why bother talking about it And even if we did    Even if we did    Where did this stuff about having kids come from Theres never been anything romantic between Gale and me When we met I was a skinnytwelveyearold and although he was only two years older he already looked like a man It took a long time for us to even become friends to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out Besides if he wants kids Gale wont have any trouble finding a wife Hes goodlooking hes strong enough to handle the work in the mines and he can hunt You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think Good hunting partners are hard to find What do you want to do I ask We can hunt fish or gather Lets fish at the lake We can leave our poles and gather in the woods Get something nice for tonight he says Tonight After the reaping everyone is supposed to celebrate And a lot of people do out of relief that their children have been spared for another year But at least two families will pull their shutters lock their doorsand try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come We make out well The predators ignore us on a day when easier tastier prey abounds By late morning we have a dozen fish a bag of greens and best of all a gallon of strawberries I found the patch a few years ago but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals On the way home we swing by the Hob the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains the Hob gradually took over the space Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day but the black markets still fairly busy We easily trade six of the fish for good bread the other two for salt Greasy Sae the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin We might do a tad better elsewhere but we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae Shes the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog We dont hunt them on purpose but if youre attacked and you take out a dog or two well meat is meat Once its in the soup Ill call it beef Greasy Sae says with a wink No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog but the Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier When we finish our business at the market we go to the back door of the mayors house to sell half the strawberries knowing he hasa particular fondness for them and can afford our price The mayors daughter Madge opens the door Shes in my year at school Being the mayors daughter youd expect her to be a snob but shes all right She just keeps to herself Like me Since neither of us really has a group of friends we seem to end up together a lot at school Eating lunch sitting next to each other at assemblies partnering for sports activities We rarely talk which suits us both just fine Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon Reaping clothes Pretty dress says Gale Madge shoots him a look trying to see if its a genuine compliment or if hes just being ironic It is a pretty dress but she would never be wearing it ordinarily She presses her lips together and then smiles Well if I end up going to the Capitol I want to look nice dont I Now its Gales turn to be confused Does she mean it Or is she messing with him Im guessing the second You wont be going to the Capitol says Gale coolly His eyes land on a small circular pin that adorns her dress Real gold Beautifully crafted It could keep a family in bread for months What can you have Five entries I had six when I was just twelve years old Thats not her fault I say No its no ones fault Just the way it is says Gale Madges face has become closed offShe puts the money for the berries in my hand Good luck Katniss You too I say and the door closes We walk toward the Seam in silence I dont like that Gale took a dig at Madge but hes right of course The reaping system is unfair with the poor getting the worst of it You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve That year your name is entered once At thirteen twice And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen the final year of eligibility when your name goes into the pool seven times Thats true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem But heres the catch Say you are poor and starving as we were You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae Each tessera is worth a meager years supply of grain and oil for one person You may do this for each of your family members as well So at the age of twelve I had my name entered four times Once because I had to and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself Prim and my mother In fact every year I have needed to do this And the entries are cumulative So now at the age of sixteen my name will be in thereaping twenty times Gale who is eighteen and has been either helping or singlehandedly feeding a family of five for seven years will have his name in fortytwo times You can see why someone like Madge who has never been at risk of needing a tessera can set him off The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam Not impossible but slim And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol not the districts certainly not Madges family its hard not to resent those who dont have to sign up for tesserae Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected On other days deep in the woods Ive listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another Its to the Capitols advantage to have us divided among ourselves he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine If it wasnt reaping day If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what Im sure she thought was a harmless comment As we walk I glance over at Gales face still smoldering underneath his stony expression His rages seem pointless to me although I never say so Its not that I dont agree with him I do But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the woods It doesnt change anything It doesnt make things fair It doesnt fill our stomachs In fact it scares off the nearby game I let him yell though Better he does it in the woods than in the district Gale and I divide our spoils leaving two fish a couple of loaves of good bread greens a quart of strawberries salt paraffin and a bit of money for each See you in the square I say Wear somethingpretty he says flatly At home I find my mother and sister are ready to go My mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days Prim is in my first reaping outfit a skirt and ruffled blouse Its a bit big on her but my mother has made it stay with pins Even so shes having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back A tub of warm water waits for me I scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair To my surprise my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me A soft blue thing with matching shoes Are you sure I ask Im trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her For a while I was so angry I wouldnt allow her to do anything for me And this is something special Her clothes from herpast are very precious to her Of course Lets put your hair up too she says I let her toweldry it and braid it up on my head I can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall You look beautiful says Prim in a hushed voice And nothing like myself I say I hug her because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her Her first reaping Shes about as safe as you can get since shes only entered once I wouldnt let her take out any tesserae But shes worried about me That the unthinkable might happen I protect Prim in every way I can but Im powerless against the reaping The anguish I always feel when shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my ace I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm Tuck your tail in little duck I say smoothing the blouse back in place Prim giggles and gives me a small Quack Quack yourself I say with a light laugh The kind only Prim can draw out of me Come on lets eat I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew but that will be for supper We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal to make it special we say Instead we drink milk from Prims goat Lady and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain although no one has much appetite anyway At one oclock we head for the square Attendance is mandatory unless you are on deaths door This evening officials will come around and check to see if this is the case If not youll be imprisoned Its too bad really that they hold the reaping in the square one of the few places in District  that can be pleasant The squares surrounded by shops and on public market days especially if theres good weather it has a holiday feel to it But today despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings theres an air of grimness The camera crews perched like buzzards on rooftops only add to the effect People file in silently and sign in The reaping is a good opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as well Twelve through eighteenyearolds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages theoldest in the front the young ones like Prim toward the back Family members line up around the perimeter holding tightly to one anothers hands But there are others too who have no one they love at stake or who no longer care who slip among the crowd taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn Odds aregiven on their ages whether theyre Seam or merchant if they will break down and weep Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully carefully These same people tend to be informers and who hasnt broken the law I could be shot on a daily basis for hunting but the appetites of those in charge protect me Not everyone can claim the same Anyway Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head the bullet would be much quicker The space gets tighter more claustrophobic as people arrive The squares quite large but not enough to hold District s population of about eight thousand Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets where they can watch the event on screens as its televised live by the state I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building It holds three chairs a podium and two large glass balls one for the boys and one for the girls I stare at the paper slips in the girls ball Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting Two of the three chairs fill with Madges father Mayor Undersee whos a tall balding man and Effie Trinket District s escort fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin pinkish hair and spring green suit They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat Just as the town clock strikes two the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read Its the same story every year He tells of the history of Panem the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America He lists the disasters the droughts the storms the fires the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land the brutal war for what little sustenance remained The result was Panem a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens Then came the Dark Days the uprising of the districts against the Capitol Twelve were defeated the thirteenth obliterated The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated it gave us the Hunger Games The rules of the Hunger Games are simple In punishment for the uprising each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy called tributes to participate The twentyfour tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland Over a period of several weeks the competitors must fight to the deathThe last tribute standing wins Taking the kids from our districts forcing them to kill one another while we watch this is the Capitols way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion Whatever words they use the real message is clear Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and theres nothing you can do If you lift a finger we will destroy every last one of you Just as we did in District Thirteen To make it humiliating as well as torturous the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity a sporting event pitting every district against the others The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home and their district will be showered with prizes largely consisting of food All year the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks intones the mayor Then he reads the list of past District  victors In seventyfour years we have had exactly two Only one is still alive Haymitch Abernathy a paunchy middleaged man who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible staggers onto the stage and falls into the third chair Hes drunk Very The crowd responds with its token applause but hes confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug which she barely manages to fend off The mayor looks distressed Since all of this is being televised right now District  is the laughingstock of Panem and he knows it He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Effie Trinket Bright and bubbly as ever Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature Happy Hunger Games And may the odds be ever in your favor Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly offcenter since her encounter with Haymitch She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here although everyone knows shes just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation Through the crowd I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile As reapings go this one at least has a slight entertainment factor But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his fortytwo names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor Not compared to a lot of the boys And maybe hes thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away But there are still thousands of slips I wish I could whisper to him Its time for the drawing Effie Trinket says as she always does Ladies first and crosses tothe glass ball with the girls names She reaches in digs her hand deep into the ball and pulls out a slip of paper The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop and Im feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that its not me that itsnot me that its not me Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium smoothes the slip of paper and reads out the name in a clear voice And its not me Its Primrose EverdeenOne time when I was in a blind in a tree waiting motionless for game to wander by I dozed off and fell ten feet to the ground landing on my back It was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs and I lay there struggling to inhale to exhale to do anything Thats how I feel now trying to remember how to breathe unable to speak totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull Someone is gripping my arm a boy from the Seam and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me There must have been some mistake This cant be happening Prim was one slip of paper in thousands Her chances of being chosen so remote that Id not even bothered to worry about her Hadnt I done everything Taken the tesserae refused to let her do the same One slip One slip in thousands The odds had been entirely in her favor But it hadnt mattered Somewhere far away I can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelveyearold gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair And then I see her the blood drained from her face hands clenched in fists at her sides walking with stiff small steps up toward the stage passing me and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt Its this detail the untucked blouse forming a ducktail that brings me back to myself Prim The strangled cry comes out of my throat and my muscles begin to move again Prim I dont need to shove through the crowd The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage I reach her just as she is about to mount the steps With one sweep of my arm I push her behind me I volunteer I gasp I volunteer as tribute Theres some confusion on the stageDistrict  hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty The rule is that once a tributes name has been pulled from the ball another eligible boy if a boys name has been read or girl if a girls name has been read can step forward to take his or her place In some districts in which winning the reaping is such a great honor people are eager to risk their lives the volunteering is complicated But in District  where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse volunteers are all but extinct Lovely says Effie Trinket But I believe theres a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers and if one does come forth then we um    She trails off unsure herself What does it matter says the mayor Hes looking at me with a pained expression on his face He doesnt know me really but theres a faint recognition there I am the girl who brings the strawberries The girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion The girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother andsister as he presented her the oldest child with a medal of valor A medal for her father vaporized in the mines Does he remember that What does it matter he repeats gruffly Let her come forward Prim is screaming hysterically behind me Shes wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice No Katniss No You cant go Prim let go I say harshly because this is upsetting me and I dont want to cry When they televise the replay of the reapings tonight everyone will make note of my tears and Ill be marked as an easy target A weakling I will give no one that satisfaction Let go I can feel someone pulling her from my back I turn and see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and shes thrashing in his arms Up you go Catnip he says in a voice hes fighting to keep steady and then he carries Prim off toward my mother I steel myself and climb the steps Well bravo gushes Effie Trinket Thats the spirit of the Games Shes pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it Whats your name I swallow hard Katniss Everdeen I say I bet my buttons that was your sister Dont want her to steal all the glory do we Come on everybody Lets give a big round of applause to our newest tribute trills Effie Trinket To the everlasting credit of the people of District  not one person claps Not even the ones holding betting slips the ones who are usually beyond caring Possibly because they know me from the Hob or knew my father or have encountered Prim who noone can help loving So instead of acknowledging applause I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage Silence Which says we do not agree We do not condone All of this is wrong Then something unexpected happens At least I dont expect it because I dont think of District  as a place that cares about me But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prims place and now it seems I have become someone precious At first one then another then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district occasionally seen at funerals It means thanks it means admiration it means goodbye to someone you love Now I am truly in danger of crying but fortunately Haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me Look at her Look at this one he hollers throwing an arm around my shoulders Hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck I like her His breath reeks of liquor and its been a long time since hes bathed Lots of    He cant think of the word for a while Spunk he says triumphantly More than you he releases me and starts for the front of the stage More than you he shouts pointing directly into acamera Is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol Ill never know because just as hes opening his mouthto continue Haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious Hes disgusting but Im grateful With every camera gleefully trained on him I have just enough time to release the small choked sound in my throat and compose myself I put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance I can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale For a moment I yearn for something    The idea of us leaving the district    Making our way in the woods    But I know I was right about not running off Because who else would have volunteered for Prim Haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher and Effie Trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again What an exciting day she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig which has listed severely to the right But more excitement to come Its time to choose our boy tribute Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys names and grabs the first slip she encounters She zips back to the podium and I dont even have time to wishfor Gales safety when shes reading the name Peeta Mellark Peeta Mellark Oh no I think Not him Because I recognize this name although I have never spoken directly to its owner Peeta Mellark No the odds are not in my favor today I watch him as he makes his way toward the stage Medium height stocky build ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead The shock of the moment is registering on his face you can see his struggle to remain emotionless but his blue eyes show the alarm Ive seen so often in prey Yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place Effie Trinket asks for volunteers but no one steps forward He has two older brothers I know Ive seen them in the bakery but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont This is standard Family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day What I did was the radical thing The mayor begins to read the long dull Treaty of Treason as he does every year at this point its required but Im not listening to a word Why him I think Then I try to convince myself it doesnt matter Peeta Mellark and I are not friends Not even neighbors We dont speak Our only real interaction happened years ago Hes probably forgotten it But I havent and I know I never will    It was during the worst time My father had beenkilled in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember The numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would hit me out of nowhere doubling me over racking my body with sobs Where are you I would cry out in my mind Where have you gone Of course there was never any answer The district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job Only she didnt She didnt do anything but sit propped up in achair or more often huddled under the blankets on her bed eyes fixed on some point in the distance Once in a while shed stir get up as if moved by some urgent purpose only to then collapse back into stillness No amount of pleading from Prim seemed to affect her I was terrified I suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness but at the time all I knew was that I had lost not only a father but a mother as well At eleven years old with Prim just seven I took over as head of the family There was no choice I bought our food at the market and cooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and myself looking presentableBecause if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home Id grown up seeing those home kids at school The sadness the marks of angry hands on their faces the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward I could never let that happen to Prim Sweet tiny Prim who cried when I cried before she even knew the reason who brushed and plaited my mothers hair before we left for school who still polished my fathers shaving mirror each night because hed hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the Seam The community home would crush her like a bug So I kept our predicament a secret But the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death Theres no other way to put it I kept telling myself if I could only hold out until May just May th I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us Only there were still several weeks to go We could well be dead by then Starvations not an uncommon fate in District  Who hasnt seen the victims Older people who cant work Children from a family with too many to feed Those injured in the mines Straggling through the streets And one day you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall orlying in the Meadow you hear the wails from a house and the Peacekeepers are called in to retrieve the body Starvation is never the cause of death officially Its always the flu or exposure or pneumonia But that fools no one On the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets I had been in town trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prims in the public market but there were no takers Although I had been to the Hob on several occasions with my father I was too frightened to venture into that rough gritty place alone The rain had soaked through my fathers hunting jacket leaving me chilled to the bone For three days wed had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves Id found in the back of a cupboard By the time the market closed I was shaking so hard I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle I didnt pick it up for fear I would keel over and be unable to regain my feet Besides no onewanted those clothes I couldnt go home Because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips I couldnt walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches I had scavenged atthe edge of the woods after the coal had run out my bands empty of any hope I found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople The merchants live above their businesses so I was essentially in their backyards I remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring a goat or two in a pen one sodden dog tied to a post hunched defeated in the muck All forms of stealing are forbidden in District  Punishable by death But it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins and those were fair game Perhaps a bone at the butchers or rotted vegetables at the grocers something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat Unfortunately the bins had just been emptied When I passed the bakers the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming I felt dizzy The ovens were in the back and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door I stood mesmerized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered running its icy fingers down my back forcing me back to life I lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it spotlessly heartlessly bare Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to see the bakers wife telling me to move on and did I want her to call the Peacekeepers andhow sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash The words were ugly and I had no defense As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away I noticed him a boy with blond hair peering out from behind his mothers back Id seen him at school He was in my year but I didnt know his name He stuck with the town kids so how would I His mother went back into the bakery grumbling but he must have been watching me as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree The realization that Id have nothing to take home had finally sunk in My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots It was too much I was too sick and weak and tired oh so tired Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home I thought Or better yet let me die right here in the rain There was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow and I vaguely wondered what was going on Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and I thought Its her Shes coming to drive me away with a stick But it wasnt her It was the boy In his arms he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black His mother was yelling Feed it to the pig you stupid creatureWhy not No one decent will buy burned bread He began to tear off chunks from the burned parts andtoss them into the trough and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer The boy never even glanced my way but I was watching him Because of the bread because of the red weal that stood out on his cheekbone What had she hit him with My parents never hit us I couldnt even imagine it The boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear then his attention back on the pig he threw a loaf of bread in my direction The second quickly followed and he sloshed back to the bakery closing the kitchen door tightly behind him I stared at the loaves in disbelief They were fine perfect really except for the burned areas Did he mean for me to have them He must have Because there they were at my feet Before anyone could witness what had happened I shoved the loaves up under my shirt wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me and walked swiftly away The heat of the bread burned into my skin but I clutched it tighter clinging to life By the time I reached home the loaves had cooled somewhatbut the insides were still warm When I dropped them on the table Prims hands reached to tear off a chunk but I made her sit forced my mother to join us at the table and poured warm tea I scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread We ate an entire loaf slice by slice It was good hearty bread filled with raisins and nuts I put my clothes to dry at the fire crawled into bed and fell into a dreamless sleep It didnt occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose Might have dropped the loaves into the flames knowing it meant being punished and then delivered them to me But I dismissed this It must have been an accident Why would he have done it He didnt even know me Still just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered  couldnt explain his actions We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school It was as if spring had come overnight Warm sweet air Fluffy clouds At school I passed the boy in the hall his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened He was with his friends and didnt acknowledge me in any way But as I collected Prim and started for home that afternoon I found him staring at me from across the school yard Our eyes met for only a second then he turned his headaway I dropped my gaze embarrassed and thats when I saw it The first dandelion of the year A bell went off in my head I thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to survive To this day I can never shake the connection between this boy Peeta Mellark and the bread that gave me hope and the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed And more than once I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me only to quickly flit away I feel like I owe him something and I hate owing people Maybe if Ihad thanked him at some point Id be feeling less conflicted now I thought about it a couple of times but the opportunity never seemed to present itself And now it never will Because were going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thankyou in there Somehow it just wont seem sincere if Im trying to slit his throat The mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and motions for Peeta and me to shake hands His are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread Peeta looks me right in the eye and gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring squeeze Maybe its just a nervous spasm We turn back toface the crowd as the anthem of Panem plays Oh well I think There will be twentyfour of us Odds are someone else will kill him before I do Of course the odds have not been very dependable of lateThe moment the anthem ends we are taken into custody I dont mean were handcuffed or anything but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past Ive never seen that happen though Once inside Im conducted to a room and left alone Its the richest place Ive ever been in with thick deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs I know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff When I sit on the couch I cant help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly It helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour The time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones I cannot afford to get upset to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose Crying is not an option There will be morecameras at the train station My sister and my mother come first I reach out to Primand she climbs on my lap her arms around my neck headon my shoulder just like she did when she was a toddler My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us For a few minutes we say nothing Then I start telling themall the things they must remember to do now that I will not be there to do them for them Prim is not to take any tesserae They can get by iftheyre careful on selling Prims goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam Gale will get her the herbs she doesnt grow herself but she must be very careful to describe them because hes not as familiar with them as I am Hell also bring them game he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago and will probably not ask for compensation but they should thank him with some kind of trade like milk or medicine I dont bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous The woods terrified her and whenever I shot something shed get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough But she makes out well with her goat so I concentrate on that When I am done with instructions about fueland trading and staying in school I turn to my mother and grip her arm hard Listen to me Are you listening to me She nods alarmed by my intensity She must know whats coming You cant leave again I say My mothers eyes find the floor I know I wont I couldnt help what Well you have to help it this time You cant clock out and leave Prim on her own Theres no me now to keep you both alive It doesnt matter what happens Whatever you see on the screen You have to promise me youll fight through it My voice has risen to a shout In it is all the anger all the fear I felt at her abandonment She pulls her arm from my grasp moved to anger herself now I was ill I could have treated myself if Id had the medicine I have now That part about her being ill might be true Ive seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since Perhaps it is a sickness but its one we cant afford Then take it And take care of her I say Ill be all right Katniss says Prim clasping my face in her hands But you have to take care too Youre so fast and brave Maybe you can win I cant win Prim must know that in her heart The competition will be far beyond my abilities Kids from wealthier districts where winning is a huge honor whove been trained their whole lives for this Boys who are two to three times my size Girlswho know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife Oh therell be people like me too People to weed out before the real fun begins Maybe I say because I can hardly tell my mother to carry on if Ive already given up myself Besides it isnt in my nature to go down without a fight even when things seem insurmountable Then wed be rich as Haymitch I dont care if were rich I just want you to come home You will try wont you Really really try asks Prim Really really try I swear it I say And I know because of Prim Ill have to And then the Peacekeeper is at the door signaling our time is up and were all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all Im saying is I love you I love you both And theyre saying it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out Someone else enters the room and when I look up Im surprised to see its the baker Peeta Mellarks father I cant believe hes come to visit me After all Ill be trying to kill his son soon But we do know each other a bit and he knows Prim even better When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wifeisnt around because hes so much nicer I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread But why has he come to see me The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs Hes a big broadshouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens He musthave just said goodbye to his son He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me I open it and find cookies These are a luxury we can never afford Thank you I say The bakers not a very talkative man in the best of times and today he has no words at all I had some of your bread this morning My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it He nods as if remembering the squirrel Not your best trade I say He shrugs as if it couldnt possibly matter Then I cant think of anything else so we sit in silence until a Peacemaker summons him He rises and coughs to clear his throat Ill keep an eye on the little girl Make sure shes eating I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words People deal with me but they are genuinely fond of Prim Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive My next guest is also unexpected Madge walks straight to me She is not weepyor evasive instead theres an urgency about her tone that surprises me They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena One thing to remind you of home Will you wear this She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier I hadnt paid much attention to it before but now I see its a small bird in flight Your pin I say Wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind Here Ill put it on your dress all right Madge doesnt wait for an answer she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress Promise youll wear it into the arena Katniss she asks Promise Yes I say Cookies A pin Im getting all kinds of gifts today Madge gives me one more A kiss on the cheek Then shes gone and Im left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along Finally Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us but when he opens his arms I dont hesitate to go into them His body is familiar to me the way it moves the smell of wood smoke even the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet moments on a hunt but this is the first time I really feel it lean and hardmuscled against my own Listen he says Getting a knife should be pretty easy but youve got to get your hands on a bow Thats your best chance They dont always have bows I say thinking of theyear there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with Then make one says Gale Even a weak bow is better than no bow at all I have tried copying my fathers bows with poor results Its not that easy Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes I dont even know if therell be wood I say Another year they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes I particularly hated that year Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst Theres almost always some wood Gale says Since that year half of them died of cold Not much entertainment in that Its true We spent one Hunger Games watching theplayers freeze to death at night You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything It was considered very anticlimactic in the Capitol all those quiet bloodless deaths Since then theres usually been wood to make fires Yes theres usually some I say Katniss its just hunting Youre the best hunter I know says Gale Its not just hunting Theyre armed They think I say So do you And youve had more practice Realpractice he says You know how to kill Not people I say How different can it be really says Gale grimly The awful thing is that if I can forget theyre people it will be no different at all The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more time but theyre taking him away and I start to panic Dont let them starve I cry out clinging to his hand I wont You know I wont Katniss remember I he says and they yank us apart and slam the door and Ill never know what it was he wanted me to remember Its a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station Ive never been in a car before Rarely even ridden in wagons In the Seam we travel on foot Ive been right not to cry The station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face But Ive had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall thats airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored Peeta Mellark on the other hand has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games To appear weak and frightened to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all and then come out fighting This worked verywell for a girl Johanna Mason from District  a few years back She seemed like such a sniveling cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left It turned out she could kill viciously Pretty clever the way she played it But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because hes a bakers son All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broadshouldered and strong It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him We have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images then were allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us The train begins to move at once The speed initially takes my breath away Of course Ive never been on a train as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties For us thats mainly transporting coal But this is no ordinary coal train Its one of the highspeed Capitol models that average  miles per hour Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day In school they tell us the Capitolwas built in a place once called the Rockies District  was in a region known isAppalachia Even hundreds of years ago they mined coal here Which is why our miners have to dig so deep Somehow it all comes back to coal at school Besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coalrelated Except for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem Its mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol I know there must be more than theyre telling us an actual account of what happened during the rebellion But I dont spend much time thinking about it Whatever the truth is I dont see how it will help me get food on the table The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice Building We are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom a dressing area and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water We dont have hot water at home unless we boil it There are drawers filled with fine clothes and Effie Trinket tells me to do anything I want wear anything I want everything is at my disposal Just be ready for supper in an hour I peel off my mothers blue dress and take a hot shower Ive never had a shower before Its like being in a summer rain only warmer I dress in a dark green shirt and pants At the last minute I remember Madges little gold pin For the first time I get a good look at it Its as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ringaround it The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips I suddenly recognize it A mocking jay Theyre funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol During the rebellion the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons The common term for them was muttations or sometimes mutts for short One was a special bird called a jabber jay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations They were homing birds exclusively male that were released into regions where the Capitols enemies were known to be hiding After the birds gathered words theyd fly back to centers to be recorded It took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts how private conversations were being transmitted Then of course the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies and the joke was on it So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild Only they didnt die off Instead the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds from a childs highpitched warble to a mans deep tones And they could recreate songs Not just a few notes but whole songswith multiple verses if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice My father was particularly fond of mockingjays When we went hunting he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and after a politepause theyd always sing back Not everyone is treated with such respect But whenever my father sang all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen His voice was that beautiful high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone Still theres something comforting about the little bird Its like having a piece of my father with me protecting me I fasten the pin onto my shirt and with the dark green fabric as a background I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper I follow her through the narrow rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls Theres a table where all the dishes are highly breakable Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us the chair next to him empty Wheres Haymitch asks Effie Trinket brightly Last time I saw him he said he was going to take a nap says Peeta Well its been anexhausting day says Effie Trinket I think shes relieved by Haymitchs absence and who can blame her The supper comes in courses A thick carrot soup green salad lamb chops and mashed potatoes cheese and fruit a chocolate cake Throughout the meal Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because theres more to come But Im stuffing myself because Ive never had food like this so good and so much and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds At least you two have decent manners says Effie as were finishing the main course The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages It completely upset my digestion The pair last year were two kids from the Seam whod never not one day of their lives had enough to eat And when they did have food table manners were surely the last thing on their minds Peetas a bakers son My mother taught Prim and I to eat properly so yes I can handle a fork and knife But I hate Effie Trinkets comment so much I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth This makes her purse her lips tightly together Now that the meals over Im fighting to keep the food down I can see Peetas looking a little green too Neither of ourstomachs is used to such rich fare But if I can hold down Greasy Saes concoction of mice meat pig entrails and tree bark a winter specialty Im determined to hang on to this We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across Panem They try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live but only people in the Capitol could really do that since none of them have to attend reapings themselves One by one we see the other reapings the names called the volunteers stepping forward or more often not We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition A few stand out in my mind Amonstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District  A foxfaced girl with sleek red hair from District  A boy with a crippled foot from District  And most hauntingly a twelveyearold girl from District  She has dark brown skin and eyes but other than that shes very like Prim in size and demeanor Only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her Theres no one willing to take her place Last of all they show District  Prim being called me running forward tovolunteer You cant miss the desperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me as if Im afraid no one will hear and theyll take Prim away But of course they do hear I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowds refusal to applaud The silent salute One says that District  has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming As if on cue Haymitch falls off the stage and they groan comically Peetas name is drawn and he quietly takes his place We shake hands They cut to the anthem again and the program ends Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation A lot about televised behavior Peeta unexpectedly laughs He was drunk says Peeta Hes drunk every year Every day I add I cant help smirking a little Effie Trinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from her Yes hisses Effie Trinket How odd you two find it amusing You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these Games The one who advises you lines up your sponsors and dictates the presentation of any gifts Haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death Just thenHaymitch staggers into the compartment I miss supper he says in a slurred voice Then he vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the mess So laugh away says Effie Trinket She hops in her pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the roomFor a few moments Peeta and I take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up We exchange a glance Obviously Haymitch isnt much but Effie Trinket is right about one thing once were in the arena hes all weve got As if by some unspoken agreement Peeta and I each take one of Haymitchs arms and help him to his feet I tripped Haymitch asks Smells bad He wipes his hand on his nose smearing his face with vomit Lets get you back to your room says Peeta Clean you up a bit We halflead halfcarry Haymitch back to his compartment Since we cant exactly set him down on the embroidered bedspread we haul him into the bathtuband turn the shower on him He hardly notices Its okay Peeta says to me Ill take it from here I canthelp feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want to do is strip down Haymitch wash the vomit out of his chest hair and tuck him into bed Possibly Peeta is trying to make a good impression on him to be his favorite once the Games begin But judging by the state hes in Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow All right I say I can send one of the Capitol people to help you Theres any number on the train Cooking for us Waiting on us Guarding us Taking care of us is their job No I dont want them says Peeta I nod and head to my own room I understand how Peeta feels I cant stand the sight of the Capitol people myself But making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge So Im pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think Its because hes being kind Just as he was kind to give me the bread The idea pulls me up short A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there And I cant let Peeta do thisNot where were going So I decide from this moment on to have as little as possible to do with the bakers son When I get back to my room the train is pausing at a platform to refuel I quickly open the window toss the cookies Peetas father gave me out of the train and slam the glass shut No more No more of either of them Unfortunately the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track I only see the image for a moment because the train is off again but its enough Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago    I had just turned away from Peeta Mellarks bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasnt lost I plucked it carefully and hurried home I grabbed a bucket and Prims hand and headed to the Meadow and yes it was dotted with the goldenheaded weeds After wed harvested those we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until wed filled the bucket with the dandelion greens stems and flowers That night we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread What else Prim asked me What other food can we find All kinds of things I promised her I just have to remember them My mother had a book shed brought with her from the apothecary shop The pages weremade of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants Neat handwritten blocks told their names where to gather them when they came in bloom their medical uses But my father added other entries to the book Plants for eating not healing Dandelions pokeweed wild onions pines Prim and I spent the rest of the night poring over those pages The next day we were off school For a while I hung around the edges of the Meadow but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence It was the first time Id been there alone without my fathers weapons to protect me But Iretrieved the small bow and arrows hed made me from a hollow tree I probably didnt go more than twenty yards into the woods that day Most of the time I perched up in the branches of an old oak hoping for game to come by After several hours I had the good luck to kill a rabbit Id shot a few rabbits before with my fathers guidance But this Id done on my own We hadnt had meat in months The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother She roused herself skinned the carcass and made a stew with the meat and some more greens Prim hadgathered Then she acted confused and went back to bed but when the stew was done we made her eat a bowl The woods became our savior and each day I went a bit farther into its arms It was slowgoing at first but I was determined to feed us I stole eggs from nests caught fish in nets sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet Plants are tricky Many are edible but one false mouthful and youre dead I checked and doublechecked the plants I harvested with my fathers pictures I kept us alive Any sign of danger a distant howl the inexplicable break of a branch sent me flying back to the fence at first Then I began to risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on Bears and cats lived deeper in perhaps disliking the sooty reek of our district On May th I went to the Justice Building signed up for my tesserae and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in Prims toy wagon On the eighth of every month I was entitled to do the same I couldnt stop hunting and gathering of course The grain was not enough to live on and there were other things to buy soap and milk and thread What we didnt absolutely have to eat I began to trade at the Hob It was frightening to enter that place without myfather at my side but people had respected him and they accepted me Game was game after all no matter whod shot it I also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasnt around The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey The mayor had a passion for strawberries In late summer I was washing up in a pond when I noticed the plants growing around me Tall with leaves like arrowheads Blossoms with three white petals I knelt down in the water my fingers digging into the soft mud and I pulled up handfuls of the roots Small bluish tubers that dont look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato Katniss I said aloud Its the plant I was named for And I heard my fathers voice joking As long as you can find yourself youll never starve I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick gathering the tubers that floated to the topThat night we feasted on fish and Katniss roots until we were all for the firsttime in months full Slowly my mother returned to us She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies One day I heard her singing Prim was thrilled to have her back but I kept watching waiting for her to disappear on us again I didnt trust her And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness for her neglect for the months she had put us through Prim forgave her but I had taken a step back from my mother put up a wall to protect myself from needing her and nothing was ever the same between us again Now I was going to die without that ever being set right I thought of how I had yelled at her today in the Justice Building I had told her I loved her too though So maybe it would all balance out For a while I stand staring out the train window wishing I could open it again but unsure of what would happen at such high speed In the distance I see the lights of another district   I dont know I think about the people in their houses settling in for bed I imagine my home with its shutters drawn tight What are they doing now my mother and Prim Were they able to eat supper The fish stew and the strawberries Or did it lay untouched on their plates Did they watch the recap of the days events on the battered old TV that sits on the table against the wall Surely there were more tears Is my mother holding up being strong for Prim Or has she already started to slip away leaving the weight of the world on my sisters fragile shoulders Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight The thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me If she cries he will nose his way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down and falls asleep Im so glad I didnt drown him Imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness This day has been endless Could Gale and I have been eating blackberries only this morning It seems like a lifetime ago Like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare Maybe if I go to sleep I will wake up back in District  where I belong Probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns but I just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear The sheets are made of soft silky fabric A thick fluffy comforter gives immediate warmth If Im going to cry now is the time to do it By morning Ill be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face But no tears come Im too tired or too numb to cry The only thing I feel is a desire to be somewhere else So I let the train rock me into oblivion Gray light is leaking throughthe curtains when the rapping rouses me I hear Effie Trinkets voice calling me to rise Up up up Its going to be a big big big day I try and imagine for a moment what it must be like inside thatwomans head What thoughts fill her waking hours What dreams come to her at night I have no idea I put the green outfit back on since its not really dirty just slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor My fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and I think of the woods and of my father and of my mother and Prim waking up having to get on with things I slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the reaping and it doesnt look too bad so I just leave it up It doesnt matter We cant be far from the Capitol now And once we reach the city my stylist will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies tonight anyway I just hope I get one who doesnt think nudity is the last word in fashion As I enter the dining car Effie Trinket brushes by me with a cup of black coffee Shes muttering obscenities under her breath Haymitch his face puffy and red from the previous days indulgences is chuckling Peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassedSit down Sit down says Haymitch waving me over The moment I slide into my chair Im served an enormous platter of food Eggs ham piles of fried potatoes A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled The basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week Theres an elegant glass of orange juice At least I think its orange juice Ive only even tasted an orange once at New Years when my father bought one as a special treat A cup of coffee My mother adores coffee which we could almost never afford but it only tastes bitter and thin to me A rich brown cup of something Ive never seen They call it hot chocolate says Peeta Its good I take a sip of the hot sweet creamy liquid and a shudder runs through me Even though the rest of the meal beckons I ignore it until Ive drained my cup Then I stuff down every mouthful I can hold which is a substantial amount being careful to not overdo it on the richest stuff One time my mother told me that I always eat like Ill never see food again And I said I wont unless I bring it home That shut her up When my stomach feels like its about to split open I lean back and take in my breakfast companions Peeta is still eating breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate Haymitch hasnt paid much attention to his platter but hes knockingback a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle Judging by the fumes its some kind of spirit I dont know Haymitch but Ive seen him often enough in the Hob tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor Hell be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol I realize I detest Haymitch No wonder the District  tributes never stand a chance It isnt just that weve been underfed and lack training Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it But we rarely get sponsors and hes a big part of the reason why The rich people who back tributeseither because theyre betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with So youre supposed to give us advice I say to Haymitch Heres some advice Stay alive says Haymitch and then bursts out laughing I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember Im having nothing more to do with him Im surprised to see the hardness in his eyes He generally seems so mild Thats very funny says Peeta Suddenly he lashes out at the glass in Haymitchs hand It shatters on the floor sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train Only not to us Haymitch considers this a moment then punches Peeta in the jaw knocking him from his chair When he turns back to reach for the spirits I drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle barely missing his fingers I brace myself to deflect his hit but it doesnt come Instead he sits back and squints at us Well whats this says Haymitch Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw No says Haymitch stopping him Let the bruise show The audience will think youve mixed it up with another tribute before youve even made it to the arena Thats against the rules says Peeta Only if they catch you That bruise will say you fought you werent caught even better says Haymitch He turns to me Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table The bow and arrow is my weapon But Ive spent a fair amount of time throwing knives as well Sometimes if Ive wounded an animal with an arrow its better to get a knife into it too before I approach it I realize that if I want Haymitchs attention this is my moment to make an impression I yank the knife out of the table get a grip on the blade and then throw it into the wallacross the room I was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick but it lodges in the seam between two panels making me look a lot better than I am Stand over here Both of you says Haymitch nodding to the middle of the room We obey and he circles us prodding us like animals at times checking our muscles examining our faces Well youre not entirely hopeless Seem fit And once the stylists get hold of you youll be attractive enough Peeta and I dont question this The Hunger Games arent a beauty contest but the bestlooking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors All right Ill make a deal with you You dont interfere with my drinking and Ill stay sober enough to help you says Haymitch But you have to do exactly what I say Its not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all Fine says Peeta So help us I say When we get to the arena whats the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone One thing at a time In a few minutes well be pulling into the station Youll be put in thehands of your stylists Youre not going to like what they do to you But no matter what it is dont resist says Haymitch But I begin No buts Dont resist says Haymitch He takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car As the door swings shut behind him the car goes dark There are still a few lights inside but outside its as if night has fallen again I realize we must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the Capitol The mountains form a natural barrier between the Capitol and the eastern districts It is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels This geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to my being a tribute today Since the rebels had to scale the mountains they were easy targets for the Capitols air forces Peeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds along The tunnel goes on and on and I think of the tons of rock separating me from the sky and my chest tightens I hate being encased in stone this way It reminds me of the mines and my father trapped unable to reach sunlight buried forever in the darkness The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment We cant help it Both Peeta and I run to the window to see what weve only seen on television the Capitol the ruling city of Panem The cameras havent lied about its grandeur If anything they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings ina rainbow of hues that tower into the air the shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal All the colors seem artificial the pinks too deep the greens too bright the yellows painful to the eyes like the flat round disks of hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in District  The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city I step away from the window sickened by their excitement knowing they cant wait to watch us die But Peeta holds his ground actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd He only stops when the train pulls into the station blocking us from their view He sees me staring at him and shrugs Who knows he says One of them may be rich I have misjudged him I think of his actions since the reaping began The friendly squeeze of my hand His father showing up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim    Did Peeta put him up to that His tears at the station Volunteering to wash Haymitch but then challenging him this morning when apparently the niceguy approach had failed And now the waving at the window already trying to win the crowd All of the pieces are still fitting together but I sense he has a plan forming He hasnt acceptedhis death He is already fighting hard to stay alive Which also means that kind Peeta Mellark the boy who gave me the bread isfighting hard to kill meRiiip I grit my teeth as Venia a woman with aqua hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows yanks a strip of Fabric from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it Sorry she pipes in her silly Capitol accent Youre just so hairy Why do these people speak in such a high pitch Why do their jaws barely open when they talk Why do the ends of their sentences go up as if theyre asking a question Odd vowels clipped words and always a hiss on the letter s    No wonder its impossible not to mimic them Venia makes whats supposed to be a sympathetic face Good news though This is the last one Ready I get a grip on the edges of the table Im seated on and nod The final swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk Ive been in the Remake Center for more than three hours and I still havent met my stylist Apparently he has no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems This has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin turning my nails into uniform shapes and primarily ridding my body of hair My legs arms torso underarms and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the Muff leaving me like a plucked bird ready for roasting I dont like it My skin feels sore and tinglingand intensely vulnerable But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch and no objection has crossed my lips Youre doing very well says some guy named Flavius He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his mouth If theres one thing we cant stand its a whiner Grease her down Venia and Octavia a plump woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin Then they pull me from the table removing the thin robe Ive been allowed to wear off and on I stand there completely naked as the three circle me wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair I know I should be embarrassed but theyre so unlike people that Im no more selfconscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet The three step back and admire their work Excellent You almost look like a human being now says Flavius and they all laugh I force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I am Thank you I say sweetly We dont have much cause to look nice in District Twelve This wins them over completely Of course you dont you poor darling says Octavia clasping her hands together in distress for me But dont worry says Venia By the time Cinna is through with you youre going to be absolutely gorgeous We promise You know now that weve gotten rid of all the hair and filth youre not horrible at all says Flavius encouragingly Lets call Cinna They dart out of the room Its hard to hate my prep team Theyre such total idiots And yet in an odd way I knowtheyre sincerely trying to help me I look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the impulse to retrieve my robe But this Cinna my stylist will surely make me remove it at once Instead my hands go to my hairdo the one area of my body my prep team had been told to leave alone My fingers stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully arranged My mother I left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car never thinking about retrieving them of trying to hold on to a piece of her of home Now I wish I had The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna enters Im taken aback by how normal he looks Most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed stenciled and surgically altered theyre grotesque But Cinnas closecropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown Hes in a simple black shirt and pants The only concession to selfalteration seems to be metallic goldeyeliner that has been applied with a light hand It brings out the flecks of gold in his green eyes And despite my disgust with the Capitol and their hideous fashions I cant help thinking how attractive it looks Hello Katniss Im Cinna your stylist he says in a quiet voice somewhat lacking in the Capitols affectations Hello I venture cautiously Just give me a moment all right he asks He walks around my naked body not touching me but taking in every inch of it with his eyes I resist the impulse to cross my arms over my chest Who did your hair My mother I say Its beautiful Classic really And in almost perfect balance with your profile She has very clever fingers he says I had expected someone flamboyant someone older trying desperately to look young someone who viewed me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter Cinna has met none of these expectations Youre new arent you I dont think Ive seen you before I say Most of the stylists are familiar constants in the everchanging pool of tributes Some have been around my whole life Yes this is my first year in the Games says Cinna So they gave you District Twelve I say Newcomers generally end up with us the least desirable district I asked for District Twelve he says without further explanation Why dont you put on your robe and well have a chat Pulling on my robe I follow him through a door into a sitting room Two red couches face off over a low table Three walls are blank the fourth is entirely glass providing a window to the city I can see by the light that it must be around noon although the sunny sky has turned overcast Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me He presses a button on the side of the table The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain tiny green peas and onions rolls shaped like flowers and for dessert a pudding the color of honey I try to imagineassembling this meal myself back home Chickens are too expensive but I could make do with a wild turkey Id need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange Goats milk would have to substitute for cream We can grow peas in the garden Id have to get wild onions from the woods I dont recognize the grain our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker perhaps for two or three squirrels As for thepudding I cant even guess whats in it Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version What must it be like I wonder to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button How would I spend the hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by What do they do all day these people in the Capitol besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment I look up and find Cinnas eyes trained on mine How despicable we must seem to you he says Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts Hes right though The whole rotten lot of them is despicable No matter says Cinna So Katniss about your costume for the opening ceremonies My partner Portia is the stylist for your fellow tribute Peeta And our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes says Cinna As you know its customary to reflect the flavor of the district For the opening ceremonies youre supposed to wear something that suggests your districts principal industry District  agriculture District  fishing District  factories This means that coming from District  Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal miners getupSince the baggy miners jumpsuits are not particularly becoming our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps One year our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to represent coal dust Its always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd I prepare myself for the worst So Ill be in a coal miner outfit I ask hoping it wont be indecent Not exactly You see Portia and I think that coal miner things very overdone No one will remember you in that And we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes unforgettable says Cinna Ill be naked for sure I think So rather than focus on the coal mining itself were going to focus on the coal says Cinna Naked and covered in black dust I think And what do we do with coal We burn it says Cinna Youre not afraid of fire are you Katniss He sees my expression and grins A few hours later I am dressed in what will either be the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies Im in a simple black unitard that covers me from ankle to neck Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees But its the fluttering cape made of streams of orange yellowand red and the matching headpiece that define this costume Cinna plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the streets Its not real flame of course just a little synthetic fire Portia and I came up with Youll be perfectly safe he says But Im not convinced I wont be perfectly barbecued by the time we reach the citys center My face is relatively clear of makeup just a bit of highlighting here and there My hair has been brushed out and then braided down my back in my usual style I want the audience to recognize you when youre in the arena says Cinna dreamily Katniss the girl who was on fire It crosses my mind that Cinnas calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman Despite this mornings revelation about Peetas character Im actually relieved when he shows up dressed in an identical costume He should know about fire being a bakers son and all His stylist Portia and her team accompany him in and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash well make Except Cinna He just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations Were whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake Center which is essentially a gigantic stable The opening ceremonies are about to start Pairs of tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horsesOurs are coal black The animals are so well trained no one even needs to guide their reins Cinna and Portia direct us into the chariot and carefully arrange our body positions the drape of our capes before moving off to consult with each other What do you think I whisper to Peeta About the fire Ill rip off your cape if youll rip off mine he says through gritted teeth Deal I say Maybe if we can get them off soon enough well avoid the worst burns Its bad though Theyll throw us into the arena no matter what condition were in I know we promised Haymitch wed do exactly what they said but I dont think he considered this angle Where is Haymitch anyway Isnt he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing says Peeta With all that alcohol in him its probably not advisable to have him around an open flame I say And suddenly were both laughing I guess were both so nervous about the Games and more pressingly petrified of being turned into human torches were not acting sensibly The opening music begins Its easy to hear blasted around the Capitol Massive doors slide open revealing the crowdlined streets The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle where they will welcome us play the anthem and escort us into the Training Center which will be our homeprison untilthe Games begin The tributes from District  ride out in a chariot pulled by snowwhite horses They look so beautiful spraypainted silver in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels District  makes luxury items for the Capitol You can hear the roar of the crowd They are always favorites District  gets into position to follow them Inno time at all we are approaching the door and I can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray The tributes from District  are just rolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch Here we go then he says and before we can react he sets our capes on fire I gasp waiting for the heat but there is only a faint tickling sensation Cinna climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses He lets out a sign of relief It works Then he gently tucks a hand under my chin Remember heads high Smiles Theyre going to love you Cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea He shouts something up at us but the music drowns him out He shouts again and gestures Whats he saying I ask Peeta For the first time I look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake flames he is dazzling And I must be too I think he said for us to hold hands says Peeta He grabs my right hand in his left and we look to Cinna for confirmation He nods and gives a thumbsup and thats the last thing I see before we enter the city The crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly changes to cheers and shouts of District Twelve Every head is turned our way pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us At first Im frozen but then I catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look In the deepening twilight the firelight illuminates our faces We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes Cinna was right about the minimal makeup we both look more attractive but utterly recognizable Remember heads high Smiles Theyre going to love you I hear Cinnas voice in my head I lift my chin a bit higher put on my most winning smile and wave with my free hand Im glad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance he is so steady solid as a rock As I gain confidence I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd The people of the Capitol are going nuts showering us with flowers shouting our names our first names which they have bothered to find on the program The pounding music the cheers the admiration work their way into my blood and I cant suppress my excitement Cinna has given me a great advantage No one will forget me Not my look not my nameKatniss The girl who was on fire For the first time I feel a flicker of hope rising up in me Surely there must be one sponsor willing to take me on And with a little extra help some food the right weapon why should I count myself out of the Games Someone throws me a red rose I catch it give it a delicate sniff and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver A hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss as if it were a real and tangible thing Katniss Katniss I can hear my name being called from all sides Everyone wants my kisses Its not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I must have completely stopped the circulation in Peetas hand Thats how tightly Ive been holding it I lookdown at our linked fingers as I loosen my grasp but he regains his grip on me No dont let go of me he says The firelight flickers off his blue eyes Please I might fall out of this thing Okay I say So I keep holding on but I cant help feeling strange about the way Cinna has linked us together Its not really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the arena to kill each other The twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle On the buildings that surround the Circle every window is packed with the most prestigious citizens of the Capitol Our horses pull our chariot right up to President Snows mansion and we come to a halt The music ends with a flourish The president a small thin man with paperwhite hair gives the official welcome from a balcony above us It is traditional to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the speech But I can see on the screen that we are getting way more than our share of airtime The darker it becomes the more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering When the national anthem plays they do make an effort to do a quick cut around to each pair of tributes but the camera holds on the District  chariot as it parades around the circle one final time and disappears into the Training Center The doors have only just shut behind us when were engulfed by the prep teams who are nearly unintelligible as they babble out praise As I glance around I notice a lot of the other tributes are shooting us dirty looks which confirms what Ive suspected weve literally outshone them all Then Cinna and Portia are there helping us down from the chariot carefully removing our flaming capes and headdresses Portia extinguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister I realize Im still glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to open We both massage our hands Thanksfor keeping hold of me I was getting a little shaky there says Peeta It didnt show I tell him Im sure no one noticed Im sure they didnt notice anything but you You should wear flames more often he says They suit you And then he gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me A warning bell goes off in my head Dont be so stupid Peeta is planning how to kill you I remind myself He is luring you in to make you easy prey The more likable he is the more deadly he is But because two can play at this game I stand on tiptoe and kiss his cheek Right on his bruiseThe Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams This will be our home until the actual Games begin Each district has an entire floor You simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district Easy enough to remember Ive ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District  Once to receive the medal for my fathers death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to my friends andfamily But thats a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air Its exhilarating and Im tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again but somehow that seems childish Apparently Effie Trinkets duties did not conclude at the station She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena In a way thats a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we havent seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train Probably passed out somewhere Effie Trinket on the other hand seems to be flying high Were the first team shes ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies Shes complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves And to hear her tell it Effie knows everyone whos anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day trying to win us sponsors Ive been very mysterious though she says her eyes squint half shut Because of course Haymitch hasnt bothered totell me your strategies But Ive done my best with what I had to work with How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister How youve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district Barbarism Thats ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter And whats she basing our success on Our table manners Everyone has their reservations naturally You being from the coal district But I said and this was very clever of me I said Well if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though its wrong Coal doesnt turn to pearls They grow in shellfish Possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds but thats untrue too Ive heard they have some sort of machine in District  that can turn graphite into diamonds But we dont mine graphite in District  That was part of District s job until they were destroyed I wonder if the people shes been plugging us to all day either know or care Unfortunately I cant seal the sponsor deals for you Only Haymitch can do that says Effie grimly But dont worry Ill get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary Although lacking in many departments Effie Trinket has a certain determination I have to admire My quarters are larger than our entire house back home They are plush like the train car but also have so many automatic gadgets that Im sure I wont have time to press all the buttons The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature pressure soaps shampoos scents oils and massaging sponges When you step out on a mat heaters come on that blowdry your body Instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair I merely place my hand on a box that sendsa current through my scalp untangling parting and drying my hair almost instantly It floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain I program the closet for an outfit to my taste The windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command You need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears hot and steamy before you in less than a minute I walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread until theres a knock on the door Effies calling me to dinner Good Im starving Peeta Cinna and Portia are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room Im gladto see the stylists particularly after I hear that Haymitch will be joining us A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster Besides dinner isnt really about food its about planning out our strategies and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable they are A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine I think about turning it down but Ive never had wine except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs and when will I get a chance to try it again I take a sip of the tart dry liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonfuls of honey Haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served It looks as if hes had his own stylist because hes clean and groomed and about as sober as Ive ever seen him He doesnt refuse the offer of wine but when he starts in on his soup I realize its the first time Ive ever seen him eat Maybe he really will pull himself together long enough to help us Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie At least theyre addressing each other decently And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists opening act While they make small talk I concentrate on the meal Mushroom soup bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper noodles in a green sauce cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes The servers all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine move wordlessly to and from the table keeping the platters and glasses full About halfway through my glass of wine my head starts feeling foggy so I change to water instead I dont like the feeling and hope it wears off soon How Haymitch can stand walking around like this fulltime is a mystery I try to focus on the talk which has turned to our interview costumes when a girl sets a gorgeouslooking cake on the table and deftly lights it It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out I have a moment of doubt What makes it burn Is it alcohol I say looking up at the girl Thats the last thing I wa oh I know you I cant place a name or time to the girls face But Im certain of it The dark red hair the striking features the porcelain white skin But even as I utter the words I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her and while I cant pull it up I know some bad memory is associated with her The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table When I look back the four adults are watching me like hawks Dont be ridiculous Katniss How could you possibly know an Avox snaps Effie The very thought Whats an Avox I ask stupidly Someone who committed a crime They cut her tongue so she cant speak says Haymitch Shes probably a traitor of some sort Not likely youd know her And even if you did youre not to speak to one of them unless its to give an order says Effie Of course you dont really know her But I do know her And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor I remember from where Thedisapproval is so high I could never admit it No I guess not I just I stammer and the wine is not helping Peeta snaps his fingers Delly Cartwright Thats who it is I kept thinking she looked familiar as well Then I realized shes a dead ringer for Delly Delly Cartwright is a pastyfaced lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly She may also be the friendliest person on the planet she smiles constantly at everybody in school even me I have never seen the girl with the red hair smile But I jump on Peetas suggestion gratefully Of course thats who I was thinking of It must be the hair I say Something about the eyes too says Peeta The energy at the table relaxes Oh well If thats all it is says Cinna And yes the cake has spirits but all the alcohol has burned off I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies thats being broadcast A few of the other couples make a nice impression but none of them can hold a candle to us Even our own party lets out an Ahh as they show us coming out of the Remake Center Whose idea was the hand holding asks Haymitch Cinnas says Portia Just the perfect touch of rebellion says Haymitch Very nice Rebellion I have to think about that one a moment But when I remember the other couples standing stiffly apart never touching or acknowledging each other as if their fellow tribute did not exist as if the Games had already begun I know what Haymitch means Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes Tomorrow morning is the first training session Meet me for breakfast and Ill tell you exactly how I want you to play it says Haymitch to Peeta and I Now go get some sleep while the grownups talk Peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms When we get to my door he leans against the frame not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him So Delly CartwrightImagine finding her lookalike here Hes asking for an explanation and Im tempted to give him one We both know he covered for me So here I am in his debt again If I tell him the truth about the girl somehow that might even things up How can it hurt really Even if he repeated the story it couldnt do me much harm It was just something I witnessed And he lied as much as I did about Delly Cartwright I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl Someone who might be able tohelp me figure out her story Gale would be my first choice but its unlikely Ill ever see Gale again I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me but I dont see how Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend Besides the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me She has reminded me why Im here Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer To tell or not to tell My brain still feels slow from the wine I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there Peeta picks up on my hesitation Have you been on the roof yet I shake my head Cinna showed me You can practically see the whole city The winds a bit loud though I translate this into No one will overhear us talking in my head You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here Can we just go up Sure come on says Peeta I follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof Theres a small domeshaped room with a door to the outside As we step into the cool windy evening air I catch my breath at the view The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies Electricity in District  comes and goes usually we only have it a few hours a day Often the evenings are spent in candlelight The only time you can count on it is when theyre airing the Games or some important government message on television that its mandatory to watch But here there would be no shortage Ever Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof I look straight down the side of the building to the street which is buzzing with people You can hear their cars an occasional shout and a strange metallic tinkling In District  wed all be thinking about bed right now I asked Cinna why they let us up here Werent they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side says Peeta Whatd he say I ask You cant says Peeta He holds out his hand into seemingly empty space Theres a sharp zap and he jerks it back Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof Always worried about our safety I say Even though Cinna has shown Peeta the roof I wonder if were supposed to be up here now so late and alone Ive never seen tributes on the Training Center roof before But that doesnt mean were not being taped Do you think theyre watching us now Maybe he admits Come see the garden On the other side of the dometheyve built a garden with flower beds and potted trees From the brancheshang hundreds of wind chimes which account for the tinkling I heard Here in the garden on this windy night its enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard Peeta looks at me expectantly I pretend to examine a blossom We were hunting in the woods one day Hidden waiting for game I whisper You and your father he whispers back No my friend Gale Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once Except one As if it were giving a warning call And then we saw her Im sure it was the same girl A boy was with her Their clothes were tattered They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep They were running as if their lives depended on it I say For a moment Im silent as I remember how the sight of this strange pair clearly not from District  fleeing through the woods immobilized us Later we wondered if we could have helped them escape Perhaps we might have Concealed them If wed moved quickly Gale and I were taken by surprise yes but were both hunters We know how animals look at bay We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them But we only watched The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere I continue to Peeta I mean one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there It didnt make a sound but they saw it A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up fast so fast like the elevator They shot some sort of spear through the boy It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well But Im certain he was dead We heard the girl scream once The boys name I think Then it was gone the hovercraft Vanished into thin air And the birds began to sing again as if nothing had happened Did they see you Peeta asked I dont know We were under a shelf of rock I reply But I do know There was a moment after the birdcall but before the hovercraft where the girl had seen us Shed locked eyes with me and called out for help But neither Gale or I had responded Youre shivering says Peeta The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body The girls scream Had it been her last Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders I start to take a step back but then I let him deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness A friend would do that right They were from here he asks and he secures a button at my neck I nod Theyd had that Capitol look about them The boy and the girl Where do you suppose they were going he asks I dont know that I say District  is pretty much the end of the line Beyond us theres only wilderness If you dont count the ruins of District  that still smolder from the toxicbombs They show it on television occasionally just to remind us Or why they would leave here Haymitch had called the Avoxes traitors Against what It could only be the Capitol But they had everything here No cause to rebel Id leave here Peeta blurtsout Then he looks around nervously It was loud enough to hear above the chimes He laughs Id go home now if they let me But you have to admit the foods prime Hes covered again If thats all youd heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol Its getting chilly We better go in he says Inside the dome its warm and bright His tone is conversational Your friend Gale Hes the one who took your sister away at the reaping Yes Do you know him I ask Not really I hear the girls talk about him a lot I thought he was your cousin or something You favor each other he says No were not related I say Peeta nods unreadable Did he come to say goodbye to you Yes I say observing him carefully So did your father He brought me cookies Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news But after watching him lie so smoothly I dont give this much weight Really Well he likes you and your sister I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys The idea that I might ever have been discussed around the dinner table at the bakery fire just in passing in Peetas house gives me a start It must have been when the mother was out of the room He knew your mother when they were kids says Peeta Another surprise But probably true Oh yes She grew up in town I say It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread Were at my door I give back his jacket See you in the morning then See you he says and walks off down the hall When I open my door the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before my shower I want to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier But I remember Im not supposed to speak to her unless Im giving her an order Oh sorry I say I was supposed to get those back to Cinna Im sorry Can you take them to him She avoids my eyes gives a small nod and heads out the door Id set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner But I know that my apology runs much deeper That Im ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods That I let the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting afinger Just like I was watching the Games I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes The shivering hasnt stopped Perhaps the girl doesnt even remember me But I know she does You dont forget the face of the person who was your last hope I pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who cant speak But I can feel her eyes staring at me piercing through walls and doors and bedding I wonder if shell enjoy watching me dieMy slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games with my mother withdrawn and unreachable with Prim emaciated and terrified I bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mineexplodes into a million deadly bits of light Dawn is breaking through the windows The Capitol has a misty haunted air My head aches and I must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night My tongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood Slowly I drag myself out of bed and into the shower I arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me Then Im deluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush Oh well At least my blood is flowing When Im dried and moisturized with lotion I find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet Tight black pants a longsleeved burgundy tunic and leather shoes I put my hair in the single braid down my back This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself No fancy hair and clothes no flaming capes Just me Looking like I could be headed for the woods It calms me Haymitch didnt give us an exact time to meet for breaklast and no one has contacted me this morning but Im hungry so I head down to the dining room hoping there will be food Im not disappointed While the table is empty a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes A young man an Avox stands at attention by the spread When I ask if I can serve myself he nods assent I load a plate with eggs sausages batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves slices of pale purple melonAs I gorge myself I watch the sun rise over the Capitol I have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew Finally I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate the way Peeta did on the train My mind wanders to my mother and Prim They must be up My mother getting their breakfast of mush Prim milking her goat before school Just two mornings ago I was home Can that be right Yes just two And now how empty the house feels even from a distance What did they say last night about my fiery debut at the Games Did it give them hope or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twentyfour tributes circled together knowing only one could live Haymitch and Peeta come in bid me good morning fill their plates It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am I need to say something to Cinna This twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games begin Surely they must know this Then I remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do If it was anyone but Cinna I might be tempted to ignore him But after last nights triumph I dont have a lot of room to criticize his choices Im nervous about the training There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together On the last afternoon well each get a chance to perform in private before the Gamemakers The thought of meeting the other tributesfacetoface makes me queasy I turn the roll I have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands but my appetite is gone When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew he pushes back his plate with a sigh He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table So lets get down to business Training First off if you like Ill coach you separately Decide now Why would you coach us separately I ask Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about says Haymitch I exchange a look with Peeta I dont have any secret skills he says And I already know what yours is right I mean Ive eaten enough of your squirrels I never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself Not out of greed But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat Beef and chicken and horse You can coach us together I tell Haymitch Peeta nods All right so give me some idea of what you can do says Haymitch I cant doanything says Peeta Unless you count baking bread Sorry I dont Katniss I already know youre handy with a knife says Haymitch Not really But I can hunt I say With a bow and arrow And youre good asks Haymitch I have to think about it Ive been putting food on the table for four years Thats no small task Im not as good as my father was but hed had more practice Ive better aim than Gale but Ive had more practice Hes a genius with traps and snares Im all right I say Shes excellent says Peeta My father buys her squirrels He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body She hits every one in the eye Its the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher She can even bring down deer This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise First that he ever noticed Second that hes talking me up What are you doing I ask him suspiciously What are you doing If hes going to help you he has to know what youre capable of Dont underrate yourself says Peeta I dont know why but this rubs me the wrong way What about you Ive seen you in the market You can lift hundredpound bags of flour I snap at him Tell him that Thats not nothing Yes and Im sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people Its not like being able to use a weapon You know it isnt he shoots back He can wrestle I tell Haymitch He came in second in our school competition last year only after his brother What use is that How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death says Peeta in disgust Theres always handtohand combat All you need is to come up with a knife and youll at least stand a chance If I get jumped Im dead I can hear my voice rising in anger But you wont Youll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows You know what my mother said to me when she came to saygoodbye as if to cheer me up she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner Then I realized she didnt mean me she meant you bursts out Peeta Oh she meant you I say with a wave of dismissal She said Shes a survivor that one She is says Peeta That pulls me up short Did his mother really say that about me Did she rate me over her son I see the pain in Peetas eyes and know he isnt lying Suddenly Im behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back the hollowness in my belly I sound eleven years old when I speak But only because someone helped me Peetas eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands and Iknow he remembers that day too But he just shrugs People will help you in the arena Theyll be tripping over each other to sponsor you No more than you I say Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch She has no idea The effect she can have He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table refusing to look at me What on earth does he mean People help me When we were dying of starvation no one helped me No one except Peeta Once I had something to barter with things changed Im a tough trader Or am I What effect do I have That Im weak and needy Is he suggesting that I got good deals because people pitied me I try to think if this is true Perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades but I always attributed that to their longstanding relationship with my father Besides my game is firstclass No one pitied me I glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me After about a minute of this Haymitch says Well then Well well well Katniss theres no guarantee theyll be bows and arrows in the arena but during your private session with the Gamemakers show them what you can do Until then stay clear of archery Are you any good at trapping I know a few basic snares I mutter That may be significant in terms of food says Haymitch And Peeta shes right never  underestimate strength in the arena Very often physical power tilts the advantage to a player In the Training Center they will have weights but dont reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes The plans the same for both of you You go to group training Spend the time trying to learn something you dont know Throw a spear Swing a mace Learn to tie a decent knot Save showing what youre best at until your private sessions Are we clear says Haymitch Peeta and I nod One last thing In public I want you by each others side every minute says Haymitch We both start to object but Haymitch slams his hand on the table Every minute Its not open for discussion You agreed to do as I said You will be together you will appear amiable to each other Now get out Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training I bite my lip and stalk back to my room making sure Peeta can hear the door slam I sit on the bed hating Haymitch hating Peeta hating myself for mentioningthat day long ago in the rain Its such a joke Peeta and I going along pretending to be friends Talking up each others strengths insisting the other take credit for their abilities Because in fact at some point were going to have to knock it off and acceptwere bitter adversaries Which Id be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for Haymitchs stupid instruction that we stick together in training Its my own fault I guess for telling him he didnt have to coach us separately But that didnt mean I wanted to do everything with Peeta Who by the way clearly doesnt want to be partnering up with me either I hear Peetas voice in my head She has no idea The effect she can have Obviously meant to demean me Right but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a compliment That he meant I was appealing in some way Its weird how much hes noticed me Like the attention hes paid to my hunting And apparently I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined either The flour The wrestling I have kept track of the boy with the bread Its almost ten I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes but now I can feel my anxiety rising again By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator I catch myself biting my nails I stop at once The actual training rooms are below ground level of our building With these elevators the ride is less than a minute The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses Although its not yet ten were the last ones to arrive The other tributes are gathered in a tense circle They each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts While someone pins the number  on my back I do a quick assessment Peeta and I are the only two dressed alike As soon as we join the circle the head trainer a tall athletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the training schedule Experts in each skill will remain at their stations We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose per our mentors instructions Some of the stations teach survival skills others fighting techniques We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute There are assistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations my eyes cant help flitting around to the other tributes Its the first time weve been assembled on level ground in simple clothes My heart sinks Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly You can see it in their bones their skin the hollow look in their eyes I may be smaller naturally but overall my familys resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area I stand straight and while Im thin Im strong Themeat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it tookto get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts the volunteers the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment The tributes from   and  traditionally have this look about them Its technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year In District  we call them the Career Tributes or just the Careers And like as not the winner will be one of them The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center my fiery entrance last night seems to vanish in the presence of my competition The other tributes were jealous of us but not because we were amazing because our stylists were Now I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career Tributes Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me They project arrogance and brutality When Atala releases us they head straight for the deadliestlooking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease Im thinking that its lucky Im a fast runner when Peeta nudges my arm and I jump He is still beside me per Haymitchs instructionsHis expression is sober Where would you like to start I look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off clearly trying to intimidate the field Then at the others the underfed the incompetent shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an ax Suppose we tie some knots I say Right you are says Peeta We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students You get the feeling that the knottying class is not the Hunger games hot spot When he realizes I know something about snares he shows us a simple excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it Then we move on to camouflage Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin weaving disguises from vines and leaves The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work I do the cakes he admits to me The cakes I ask Ive been preoccupied with watching the boy from District  send a spear through a dummys heart from fifteen yards What cakes At home The iced ones for the bakery he says He means the ones they display in the windows Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting Theyre for birthdaysand New Years Day When were in the square Prim always drags me over to admire them although wed never be able to afford one Theres little enough beauty in District  though so I can hardly deny her this I look more critically at the design on Peetas arm The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods I wonder how he knows this since I doubt hes ever been beyond the fence Has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard Somehow the whole thing his skill those inaccessible cakes the praise of the camouflage expert annoys me Its lovely If only you could frost someone to death I say Dont be so superior You can never tell what youll find in the arena Say its actually a gigantic cake begins Peeta Say we move on I break in So the next three days pass with Peeta and I going quietly from station to station We do pick up some valuable skills from starting fires to knife throwing to making shelter Despite Haymitchs order to appear mediocre Peeta excels in handtohand combat and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though wanting to save those for our private sessions The Gamemakers appeared early on the first day Twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple robes They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium sometimes wandering about to watch us jotting down notes other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them ignoring the lot of us But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District  tributes Several times Ive looked up to find one fixated on me They consult with the trainers during our meals as well We see them all gathered together when we come back Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor but at lunch the twentyfour of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium Food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table as if to prove their superiority that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice Most of the other tributes sit alone like lost sheep No one says a word to us Peeta and I eat together and since Haymitch keeps dogging us about it try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals Its not easy to find a topic Talking of home is painful Talking of the present unbearable One day Peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful toinclude types from the districts along with the refined bread of the Capitol The fishshaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District  The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from District  Somehow although its made from the same stuff it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home And there you have it says Peeta scooping the breads back in the basket You certainly know a lot I say Only about bread he says Okay now laugh as if Ive said something funny We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room All right Ill keep smiling pleasantly and you talk says Peeta Its wearing us both out Haymitchs direction to be friendly Because ever since I slammed my door theres been a chill in the air between us But we have our orders Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear Iask No but it sounds fascinating says Peeta I try and animate my face as I recall the event a true story in which Id foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue Hes much better at this than I am On the second day while were taking a shot at spear throwing he whispers to me I think we have a shadow I throw my spear which Im not too bad at actually if I dont have to throw too far and see the little girl from District  standing back a bit watching us Shes the twelveyearold the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature Up close she looks about ten She has bright dark eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound Its impossible not to think of a bird I pick up another spear while Peeta throws I think her names Rue he says softly I bite my lip Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the Meadow Rue Primrose Neither of them could tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet What can we do about it I ask him more harshly than I intended Nothing to do he says back Just making conversation Now that I know shes there its hard to ignore the child She slips up and joins us at different stations Like me shes clever with plants climbs swiftly and has good aim She can hit the target every time with a slingshot But what is a slingshot against a pound male with a sword Back on the District  floor Haymitch and Effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the day What we did who watched us how the other tributes size upCinna and Portia arent around so theres no one to add any sanity to the meals Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting anymore Instead they seem to be of one mind determined to whip us into shape Full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training Peeta is more patient but I become fed up and surly When we finally escape to bed on the second night Peeta mumbles Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink I make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a laugh Then catch myself Its messing with my mind too much trying to keep straight when were supposedly friends and when were not At least when we get into the arena Ill know where we stand Dont Dont lets pretend when theres no one around All right Katniss he says tiredly After that we only talk in front of people On the third day of training they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the Gamemakers District by district first the boy then the girl tribute As usual District  is slated to go last We linger in the dining room unsure where else to go No one comes back once they have left As the room empties the pressure to appear friendly lightens By the time they call Rue we are left alone We sit in silence until they summon Peeta He rises Remember what Haymitch saidabout being sure to throw the weights The words come out of my mouth without permission Thanks I will he says You    Shoot straight I nod I dont know why I said anything at all Although if Im going to lose Id rather Peeta win than the others Better for our district for my mother and Prim After about fifteen minutes they call my name I smooth my hair set my shoulders back and walk into the gymnasium Instantly I know Im in trouble Theyve been here too long the Gamemakers Sat through twentythree other demonstrations Had too much to wine most of them Want more than anything to go home Theres nothing I can do but continue with the plan I walk to the archery station Oh the weapons Ive been itching to get my hands on them for days Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I cant even name Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines I choose a bow string it and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder Theres a shooting range but its much too limited Standard bullseyes and human silhouettes I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target The dummy used for knife practice Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong The strings tighter than the one I use at home The arrows more rigid I missthe dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding For a moment Im humiliated then I head back to the bullseye I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons Back in the center of the gymnasium I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground Without pausing I shoulderroll forward come up on one knee and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture Its excellent shooting I turn to the Gamemakers A few are nodding approval but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table Suddenly I am furious that with my life on the line they dont even have the decency to pay attention to me That Im being upstaged by a dead pig My heart starts to pound I can feel my face burning Without thinking I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers table I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back The arrow skewers the apple in the pigs mouth and pins it to the wall behind it Everyone stares at me in disbelief Thank you for your consideration I say Then I give a slight bow and walkstraight toward the exit without being dismissedAs I stride toward the elevator I fling my bow to one side and my quiver to the other I brush past the gaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist The doors slide together and I zip upward I actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down mycheeks I can hear the others calling me from the sitting room but I fly down the hall into my room bolt the door and fling myself onto my bed Then I really begin to sob Now Ive done it Now Ive ruined everything If Id stood even a ghost of chance it vanished when I sent that arrow flying at the Gamemakers What will they do to me now Arrest me Execute me Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so I can wait on the future tributes of Panem What was I thinking shooting at the Gamemakers Of course I wasnt I was shooting at that apple because I was so angryat being ignored I wasnt trying to kill one of them If I were theyd be dead Oh what does it matter Its not like I was going to win the Games anyway Who cares what they do to me What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness Will they take their few belongings or send my mother to prison and Prim to the community home or kill them They wouldnt kill them would they Why not What do they care I should have stayed and apologized Or laughed like it was a big joke Then maybe I would have found some leniency But instead I stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door I shout for them to go away and eventually they do It takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out Then I just lay curled up on the bed stroking the silken sheets watching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol At first I expect guards to come for me But as time passes it seems less likely I calm down They still need a girl tribute from District  dont they If the Gamemakers want to punish me they can do it publicly Wait until Im in the arena and sic starving wild animals on me You can bet theyll make sure I dont have a bow and arrow to defend myself Before that though theyll give me a score so low no one in their right mind would sponsor me Thats what will happen tonight Since the training isnt open to viewers the Gamemakers announce a score for each player It gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the Games The number which is between one and twelve one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high signifies the promise of the tribute The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win Its only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training Often because of the variables in the actual arena highscoring tributes go down almost immediately And a few years ago the boy who won the Games only received a three Still the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship I had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven even if Im not particularly powerful Now Im sure Ill have the lowest score of the twentyfour If no one sponsors me my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero When Effie taps on the door tocall me to dinner I decide I may as well go The scores will be televised tonight Its not like I can hide what happened forever I go to the bathroom and wash my facebut its still red and splotchy Everyones waiting at the table even Cinna and Portia I wish the stylists hadnt shown up because for some reason I dont like the idea of disappointing them Its as if Ive thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny spoonfuls of fish soup The saltiness reminds me of my tears The adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast and I let my eyes meet Peetas He raises his eyebrows A question What happened I just give my head a small shake Then as theyre serving the main course I hear Haymitch say Okay enough small talk just how bad were you today Peeta jumps in I dont know that it mattered By the time I showed up no one even bothered to look at me They were singing some kind of drinking song I think So I threw around some heavy objects until they told me I could go That makes me feel a bit better Its not like Peeta attacked the Gamemakers but at least he was provoked too And you sweetheart says Haymitch Somehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off enough that Im at least able to speak I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers Everyone stops eating You what The horror in Effies voice confirms my worse suspicions I shot an arrow at them Not exactly at them In their direction Its like Peeta said I was shooting and they were ignoring me and I just    I just lost my head so I shot an apple out of their stupid roast pigs mouth I say defiantly And what did they say says Cinna carefully Nothing Or I dont know I walked out after that I say Without being dismissed gasps Effie I dismissed myself I said I remember how I promised Prim that I really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me Well thats that says Haymitch Then he butters a roll Do you think theyll arrest me I ask Doubt it Be a pain to replace you at this stage says Haymitch What about my family I say Will they punish them Dont think so Wouldnt make much sense See theyd have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population People would need to know what you did But they cant since its secret so itd be a waste of effort says Haymitch More likely theyll make your life hell in the arena Well theyve already promised to do that to us any way says Peeta Very true says Haymitch And I realize the impossible has happened They have actually cheered me up Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his fingers which makes Effie frown and dunks it in his wine He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to chuckleWhat were their faces like I can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up Shocked Terrified Uh ridiculous some of them An image pops into my mind One man trippedbackward into a bowl of punch Haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie although even she is suppressing a smile Well it serves them right Its their job to pay attention to you And just because you come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you Then her eyes dart around as if shes said something totally outrageous Im sorry but thats what I think she says to no one in particular Ill get a very bad score I say Scores only matter if theyre very good no one pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones For all they know you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose People use that strategy said Portia I hope thats how people interpret the four Ill probably get says Peeta If that Really is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards One almost landed on my foot I grin at him and realize that Im starving I cut off a piece of pork dunk it in mashed potatoes and start eating Its okay My family is safe And if they are safe no real harm has been done After dinner we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced on television First they show a photo of the tribute then flash their score below it The Career Tributes naturally get in the eighttoten range Most of the other players average a five Surprisingly little Rue comes up with a seven I dont know what she showed the judges but shes so tiny it must have been impressive District  comes up last as usual Peeta pulls an eight so at least a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching him I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up expecting the worst Then theyre flashing the number eleven on the screen Eleven Effie Trinket lets out a squeal and everybody is slapping me on the back and cheering and congratulating me But it doesnt seem real There must be a mistake How    How could that happen I ask Haymitch Guess they liked your temper he says Theyve got a show to put on They need some players with some heat Katniss the girl who was on fire says Cinna and gives me a hug Oh wait until you see your interview dress More flames I ask Of a sort he says mischievously Peeta and I congratulate each other another awkward moment Weve both done well but what does thatmean for the other I escape to my room as quickly as possible and burrow down under the covers The stress of the day particularly the crying has worn me out I drift off reprieved relieved and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids At dawn I lie in bed for a while watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning Its Sunday A day off at home I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week Rising early hunting and gathering then trading at the Hob I think of Gale without me Both of us can hunt alone but were better as a pair Particularly if were trying for bigger game But also in thelittler things having a partner lightened the load could even make the arduous task of filling my familys table enjoyable I had been struggling along on my own for about six months when I first ran into Gale in the woods It was a Sunday in October the air cool and pungent with dying things Id spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting Katniss The only meat Id shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other food sources Having strayed farther afield than usual I was hurrying back home lugging my burlap sacks when I came across a dead rabbit It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head About fifteen yards away was another I recognized the twitchup snares because my father had used them When the prey is caught its yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals Id been trying to use snares all summer with no success so I couldnt help dropping my sacks to examine this one My fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out Thats dangerous I jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from behind a tree He must have been watching me the whole time He was only fourteen but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me Id seen him around the Seam and at school And one other time Hed lost his father in the same blast that killed mine In January Id stood by while he received his medal of valor in the Justice Building another oldest child with no father I remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just days away from giving birth Whats your name he said coming over anddisengaging the rabbit from the snare He had another three hanging from his belt Katniss I said barely audible Well Catnip stealings punishable by death or hadnt you heard he said Katniss I said louder And I wasnt stealing it I just wanted to look at your snare Mine never catch anything He scowled at me not convinced So whered you get the squirrel I shot it I pulled my bow off my shoulder I was still using the small version my father had made me but Id been practicing with the fullsize one when I could I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game Gales eyes fastened on the bow Can I see that I handed it over Just remember stealings punishable by death That was the first time I ever saw him smile It transformed him from someone menacing to someone you wished you knew But it took several months before I returned that smile We talked hunting then I told him I might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade Not food I wanted knowledge I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day He agreed something might be worked out As the seasons went by we grudgingly began to share our knowledge our weapons our secret places that were thick with wild plums or turkeys He taught me snares and fishing I showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows And then one day without either of us saying it we became a team Dividing the work and the spoils Making sure that both our families had food Gale gave me a sense of security Id lacked since my fathers death His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods I became a much better hunter when I didnt have to look over my shoulder constantly when someone was watching my back But he turned into so much more than a hunting partner He became my confidante someone with whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the fence In exchange he trusted me with his Being out in the woods with Gale    Sometimes I was actually happy I call him my friend but in the last year its seemed too casual a word for what Gale is to me A pang of longing shoots through my chest If only he was with me now But of course I dont want that I dont want him in the arena where hed be dead in a few days I just    I just miss him And I hate being so alone Does he miss me He must I think of the eleven flashing under my name last night I know exactly what hed say tome Well theres some room for improvement there And then hed give me a smile and Id return it without hesitating now I cant help comparing what I have with Gale to what Im pretending to have with Peeta How I never question Gales motives while I do nothing but doubt the latters Its not a fair comparison really Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual need to survive Peeta and I know the others survival means our own death How do you sidestep that Effies knocking at the door reminding me theres another big big big day ahead Tomorrow night will be our televised interviews I guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that I get up and take a quick shower being a bit more careful about the buttons I hit and head down to the dining room Peeta Effie and Haymitch are huddled around the table talking in hushed voices That seems odd but hunger wins out over curiosity and I load up my plate with breakfast before I join them The stews made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today Perfect on the bed of wild rice Ive shoveled about halfway through the mound when I realize no ones talking I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth So whats going on Youre coaching us on interviews today right Thats right says Haymitch You dont have to wait until Im done I can listen and cat at the same time I say Well theres been a change of plans About our current approach says Haymitch Whats that I ask Im not sure what our current approach is Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember Haymitch shrugs Peeta has asked to be coachedseparatelyBetrayalThats the first thing I feel which is ludicrous For there to be betrayal there would have had to been trust first Between Peeta and me And trust has not been part of the agreement Were tributes But the boy who risked a beating to give me bread the one who steadied me in the chariot who covered for me with theredheaded Avox girl who insisted Haymitch know my hunting skills    Was there some part of me that couldnt help trusting him On the other hand Im relieved that we can stop the pretense of being friends Obviously whatever thin connection wed foolishly formed has been severed And high time too The Games begin in two days and trust will only be a weakness Whatever triggered Peetas decision and I suspect it had to do with my outperforming him in training I should be nothing but grateful for it Maybe hes finally accepted the fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies the better Good I say So whats the schedule Youll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and four with me for content says Haymitch You start with Effie Katniss I cant imagine what Effie will have to teach me that could take four hours but shes got me working down to the last minute We go to my rooms and she puts me in a fulllength gown and highheeled shoes not the ones Ill he wearing for the actual interview and instructs me on walking The shoes are the worst part Ive never worn high heels and cant get used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet But Effie runs around in them fulltime and Im determined that if she can do it so can I The dress poses anotherproblem It keeps tangling around my shoes so of course I hitch it up and then Effie swoops down on me like a hawk smacking my hands and yelling Not above the ankle When I finally conquer walking theres still sitting posture apparently I have a tendency to duck my head eye contact hand gestures and smiling Smiling is mostly about smiling more Effie makes me say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile while smiling or ending with a smile By lunch the muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse Well thats the best I can do Effie says with a sigh Just remember Katniss you want the audience to like you And you dont think they will I ask Not if you glare at them the entire time Why dont you save that for the arena Instead think of yourself among friends says Effie Theyre betting on how long Ill live I burst out Theyre not my friends Well try and pretend snaps Effie Then she composes herself and beams at me See like this Im smiling at you even though youre aggravating me Yes it feels very convincing I say Im going to eat  kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room hiking my skirt up to my thighs Peeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods so Im thinking the content session should be an improvement over the morning I couldnt be more wrong After lunchHaymitch takes me into thesitting room directs me to the couch and then just frowns at me for a while What I finally ask Im trying to figure out what to do with you he says How were going to present you Are you going to be charming Aloof Fierce So far youre shining like a star You volunteered to save your sister Cinna made you look unforgettable Youve got the top training score People are intrigued but no one knows who you are The impression you make tomorrow will decide exactly what I can get you in terms of sponsors says Haymitch Having watched the tribute interviews all my life I know theres truth to what hes saying If you appeal to the crowd either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric you gain favor Whats Peetas approach Or am I not allowed to ask I say Likable He has a sort of selfdeprecating humor naturally says Haymitch Whereas when you open your mouth you come across more as sullen and hostile I do not I say Please I dont know where you pulled that cheery wavy girl on the chariot from but I havent seen her before or since says Haymitch And youve given me so many reasons to be cheery I counterBut you dont have to please me Im not going to sponsor you So pretend Im the audience says Haymitch Delight me Fine I snarl Haymitch takes the role of the interviewer and I try to answer his questions in a winning fashion But I cant Im too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that I even have to answer the questions All I can think is how unjust the whole thing is the Hunger Games Why am I hopping around like some trained dog trying to please people I hate The longer the interview goes on the more my fury seems to rise to the surface until Im literally spitting out answers at him All right enough he says Weve got to find another angle Not only are you hostile I dont know anything about you Ive asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your life your family what you care about They want to know about you Katniss But I dont want them to Theyre already taking my future They cant have the things that mattered to me in the past I say Then lie Make something up says Haymitch Im not good at lying I say Well you better learn fast Youve got about as much charm as a dead slug says Haymitch Ouch That hurts Even Haymitch must know hes been too harsh because his voice softens Heres an idea Try acting humble Humble I echo That you cant believe a little girl from DistrictTwelve has done this well The whole things been more than you ever could have dreamed of Talk about Cinnas clothes How nice the people are How the city amazes you If you wont talk about yourself at least compliment the audience Just keep turning it back around all right Gush The next hours are agonizing At once its clear I cannot gush We try me playing cocky but I just dont have the arrogance Apparently Im too vulnerable for ferocity Im not witty Funny Sexy Or mysterious By the end of thesession I am no one at all Haymitch started drinking somewhere around witty and a nasty edge has crept into his voice I give up sweetheart Just answer the questions and try not to let the audience see how openly you despise them I have dinner that night in my room ordering an outrageous number of delicacies eating myself sick and then taking out my anger at Haymitch at the Hunger Games at every living being in the Capitol by smashing dishes around my room When the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down my bed her eyes widen at the mess Just leave it I yell at her Just leave it alone I hate her too with her knowing reproachful eyes that call me a coward a monster a puppet of the Capitol both now and then For her justice must finally be happening At least my death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods But instead of fleeing the room the girl closes the door behind her and goes to the bathroom She comes back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my hands Why is she doing this Why am I letting her I should have tried to save you I whisper She shakes her head Does this mean we were right to stand by That she has forgiven me No it was wrong I say She taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest I think she means that I would just have ended up an Avox too Probably would have An Avox or dead I spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl clean the room When all the garbage has been dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away she turns down my bed I crawl in between the sheets like a fiveyearold and let her tuck me in Then she goes I want her to stay until I fall asleep To be there when I wake up I want the protection of this girl even though she never had mine In the morning its not the girl but my prep team who are hanging over me My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are over This day belongs to Cinna Hes my last hope Maybe hecan make me look so wonderful no one will care what comes out of my mouth The team works on me until late afternoon turning my skin to glowing satin stenciling patterns on my arms painting flame designs on my twenty perfect nails Then Venia goes to work on my hair weaving strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left ear wraps around my head and then falls in one braid down my right shoulder They erase my face with a layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out Huge dark eyes full red lips lashes that throw off bits of light when I blink Finally they cover my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer in gold dust Then Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress but I cant really see it because its covered Close your eyes he orders I can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my naked body then the weight It must be forty pounds I clutch Octavias hand as I blindly step into my shoes glad to find they are at least two inches lower thanthe pair Effie had me practice in Theres some adjusting and fidgeting Then silence Can I open my eyes I ask Yes says Cinna Open them The creature standing before me in the fulllength mirror has come from another world Where skin shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels Because my dress oh my dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the tips of the flame design The slightest movement gives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire I am not pretty I am not beautiful I am as radiant as the sun For a while we all just stare at me Oh Cinna I finally whisper Thank you Twirl for me he says I hold out my arms and spin in a circle The prep team screams in admiration Cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the dress and shoes which are infinitely more manageable than Effies The dress hangs in such a way that I dont have to lift the skirt when I walk leaving me with one less thing to worry about So all ready for the interview then asks Cinna I can see by his expression that hes been talking to Haymitch That he knows how dreadful I am Im awful Haymitch called me a dead slug No matter what we tried I couldnt do it I just cant be one of those people he wants me to be I say Cinna thinks about this a moment Why dont you just be yourself Myself Thats no good either Haymitch says Im sullen and hostile I say Well you are    Around Haymitch says Cinna with a grin I dont find you so Theprep team adores you You even won over the Gamemakers And as for the citizens of the Capitol well they cant stop talking about you No one can help but admire your spirit My spirit This is a new thought Im not sure exactly what it means but it suggests Im a fighter In a sort of brave way Its not as if Im never friendly Okay maybe I dont go around loving everybody I meet maybe my smiles are hard to come by but I do care for some people Cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones Suppose when you answer the questions you think youre addressing a friend back home Who would your best friend be asks Cinna Gale I say instantly Only it doesnt make sense Cinna I would never be telling Gale those things about me He already knows them What about me Could you think of me as a friend asks Cinna Of all the people Ive met since I left home Cinna is by far my favorite I liked him right off and he hasnt disappointed me yet I think so but Ill be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists Youll be able to look right at me When youre asked a question find me and answer it as honestly as possible says Cinna Even if what I think is horrible I ask Because it might be really Especially if what you think is horrible says Cinna Youll try it I nod Its a plan Or at least a straw to grasp atToo soon its time to go The interviews take place on a stage constructed in front of theTraining Center Once I leave my room it will be only minutes until Im in front of the crowd the cameras all of Panem As Cinna turns the doorknob I stop his hand Cinna    Im completely overcome with stage fright Remember they already love you he says gently Just be yourself We meet up with the rest of the District  crowd at the elevator Portia and her gang have been hard at work Peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame accents While we look well together its a relief not to be dressed identically Haymitch and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion I avoid Haymitch but accept Effies compliments Effie can be tiresome and clueless but shes not destructive like Haymitch When the elevator opens the other tributes are being lined up to take the stage All twentyfour of us sit in a big arc throughout the interviews Ill be last or second to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy from each district How I wish I could be first and get the whole thing out of the way Now Ill have to listen to how witty funny humble fierce and charming everybodyelse is before I go up Plus the audience will start to get bored just as the Gamemakers did And I cant exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention Right before we parade onto the stage Haymitch comes up behind Peeta and me and growls Remember youre still a happy pair So act like it What I thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for separate coaching But I guess that was a private not a public thing Anyway theres not much chance for interaction now as we walk singlefile to our seats and take our places Just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and shallow I can feel my pulse pounding in my temples Its a relief to get to my chair because between the heels and my legs shaking Im afraid Ill trip Although evening is falling the City Circle is brighter than a summers day An elevated seating unit has been set up for prestigious guests with the stylists commanding the front row The cameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork A large balcony off a building to the right has been reserved for the Gamemakers Television crews have claimed most of the other balconies But the City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are completely packed with people Standing room only At homes and community halls around the country every television set is turned on Every citizen of Panem is tuned in There will be no blackouts tonight Caesar Flickerman the man who has hosted the interviews for more than forty years bounces onto the stage Its a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time Same face under a coating of pure white makeup Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games Same ceremonial suit midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars They do surgery in the Capitol to make people appearyounger and thinner In District  looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early You see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity ask the secret of survival A plump person is envied because they arent scraping by like the majority of us But here it is different Wrinkles arent desirable A round belly isnt a sign of success This year Caesars hair is powder blue and his eyelids and lips are coated in the same hue He looks freakish but less frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson and he seemed to bebleeding Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the audience but then gets down to business The girl tribute from District  looking provocative in a seethrough gold gown steps up the center of the stage to join Caesar for her interview You can tell her mentor didnt have any trouble coming up with an angle for her With that flowing blonde hair emerald green eyes her body tall and lush    Shes sexy all the way Each interview only lasts three minutes Then a buzzer goes off and the next tribute is up Ill say this for Caesar he really does his best to make the tributes shine Hes friendly tries to set the nervous ones at ease laughs at lame jokes and can turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he reacts I sit like a lady the way Effie showed me as the districts slip by    Everyone seems to be playing up some angle The monstrous boy from District  is a ruthless killing machine The foxfaced girl from District  sly and elusive I spotted Cinna as soon as he took his place but even his presence cannot relax me    The crippled boy from  is very quiet My palms are sweating like crazy but the jeweled dress isnt absorbent and they skid right of if I try to dry them  Rue who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with wings flutters her way to Caesar A hush falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute Caesars very sweet with her complimenting her seven in training an excellent score for one so small When he asks her what her greatest strength in the arena will be she doesnt hesitate Im very hard to catch she says in a tremulous voice And if they cant catch me they cant kill me So dont count me out I wouldnt in a million years says Caesar encouragingly The boy tribute from District  Thresh has the same dark skin as Rue but the resemblance stops there Hes one of the giants probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox but I noticed he rejected the invitations from the Career Tributes to join their crowd Instead hes been very solitary speaking to no one showing little interest in training Even so he scored a ten and its not hard to imagine he impressed the Gamemakers He ignores Caesars attempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or just remains silent If only I was his size I could get away with sullen and hostile and it would be just fine I bet half thesponsors are at least considering him If I had any money Id bet on him myself And then theyre calling Katniss Everdeen and I feel myself as if in a dreamstanding and making my way center stage I shake Caesars outstretched hand and he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off on his suit So Katniss the Capitol must be quite a change from District Twelve Whats impressed you most since you arrived here asks Caesar What What did he say Its as if the words make no sense My mouth has gone as dry as sawdust I desperately find Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him I imagine the words coming from his lips Whats impressed you most since you arrived here I rack my brain for something that made me happy here Be honest I think Be honest The lamb stew I get out Caesar laughs and vaguely I realize some of the audience has joined in The one with the dried plums asks Caesar I nod Oh I eat it by the bucketful He turns sideways to the audience in horror hand on his stomach It doesnt show does it They shout reassurances to him and applaud This is what I mean about Caesar He tries to help you out Now Katniss he says confidentially When you came out in the opening ceremonies my heart actually stopped What did you think of that costume Cinna raises one eyebrow at me Be honest You mean after I got over my fear of being burned alive I ask Big laugh A real one from the audience Yes Start then says Caesar Cinna my friend I should tell him anyway I thought Cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume Id ever seen and I couldnt believe I was wearing it I cant believe Im wearing this either I lift up my skirt to spread it out I mean look at it As the audience oohs and ahs I see Cinna make the tiniest circular motion with his finger But I know what hes saying Twirl for me I spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate Oh do that again says Caesar and so I lift up my arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly out letting the dress engulf me in flames The audience breaks into cheers When I stop I clutch Caesars arm Dont stop he says I have to Im dizzy Im also giggling which I think Ive done maybe never in my lifetime But the nerves and the spinning have gotten to me Caesar wraps a protective arm around me Dont worry Ive got you Cant have you following in your mentors footsteps Everyones hooting as the cameras find Haymitch who is by now famous for his head dive at the reaping and he waves them away goodnaturedly and points back to me Its all right Caesar reassures the crowd Shes safe with me So how about that training score Eleven Give us a hint what happened in there I glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip Um    All I can say is Ithink it was a first The cameras are right on the Gamemakers who are chuckling and nodding Youre killing us says Caesar as if in actual pain Details Details I address thebalcony Im not supposed to talk about it right The Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out Shes not Thank you I say Sorry My lips are sealed Lets go back then to the moment they called your sisters name at the reaping says Caesar His mood is quieter now And you volunteered Can you tell us about her No No not all of you But maybe Cinna I dont think Im imagining the sadness on his face Her names Prim Shes just twelve And I love her more than anything You could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now What did she say to you After the reaping Caesar asks Be honest Be honest I swallow hard She asked me to try really hard to win The audience is frozen hanging on my every word And what did you say prompts Caesar gently But instead of warmth I feel an icy rigidity take over my body My muscles tense as they do before a kill When I speak my voice seems to have dropped an octave I swore I would I bet you did says Caesar giving me a squeeze The buzzer goes off Sorry were out of time Best of luck Katniss Everdeen tribute from District Twelve The applause continues long after Im seated I look to Cinna for reassurance He gives me a subtle thumbsup Im still in a daze for the first part of Peetas interview He has the audience from the getgo though I can hear them laughing shouting out He plays up the bakers son thing comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts Then has a funny anecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers Tell me do I still smell like roses he asks Caesar and then theres a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other that brings down the house Im coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home Peeta hesitates then gives an unconvincing shake of his head Handsome lad like you There must be some special girl Come on whats her name says Caesar Peeta sighs Well there is this one girl Ive had a crush on her ever since I can remember But Im pretty sure she didnt know I was alive until the reaping Sounds of sympathy from the crowd Unrequited love they can relate to She have another fellow asks Caesar I dont know but a lot of boys like her says Peeta So heres what you do You win you go home She cant turn you down then eh says Caesarencouragingly I dont think its going to work out Winning    Wont help in my case says Peeta Why ever not says Caesar mystified Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out Because    Because    She came here with mePART IITHE GAMESFor a moment the cameras hold on Peetas downcast eyes as what he says sinks in Then I can see my face mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest magnified on every screen as I realize Me He means me I press my lips together and stare at the floor hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil up inside of me Oh that is a piece of bad luck says Caesar and theres a real edge of pain in his voice The crowd is murmuring in agreement a few have even given agonized cries Its not good agrees Peeta Well I dont think any of us can blame you Itd be hard not to fall for that young lady says Caesar She didnt know Peeta shakes his head Not until now I allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable Wouldnt you love to pull her back out here and get a response Caesar asks the audience The crowd screams assent Sadly rules are rules and Katniss Everdeens time has been spent Well best of luck to you Peeta Mellark and I think I speak for all of Panem when I say our hearts go with yours The roar of the crowd is deafening Peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me When the audience finally settles down he chokes out a quiet Thank you and returns to his seat We stand for the anthem I have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of Peeta and me separated by a few feet that in the viewers heads can never be breached Poor tragic us But I know better After the anthem the tributes file back into the Training Center lobby and onto the elevators I make sure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta The crowd slows our entourages of stylists and mentors and chaperones so we have only each other for company No one speaks My elevator stops to deposit four tributes before I am alone and then find the doors opening on the twelfth floor Peeta has only just stepped from his car whenI slam my palms into his chest He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers The urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces Peeta lands in the shards and blood immediately flows from his hands What was that for he says aghast You had no right No right to go saying those things about me I shout at him Now the elevators open and the whole crew is there Effie Haymitch Cinna and Portia Whats going on says Effie a note of hysteria in her voice Did you fall After she shoved me says Peeta as Effie and Cinna help him up Haymitch turns on me Shoved him This was your idea wasnt it Turning me into some kind of fool in front of the entire country I answer It was my idea says Peeta wincing as he pulls spikes of pottery from his palms Haymitch just helped me with it Yes Haymitch is very helpful To you I say You are a fool Haymitch says in disgust Do you think he hurt you That boy just gave yousomething you could never achieve on your own He made me look weak I say He made you look desirable And lets face it you can use all the help you can get in that department You were about as romantic as dirt until he said he wanted youNow they all do Youre all theyre talking about The starcrossed lovers from District Twelve says Haymitch But were not starcrossed lovers I say Haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall Who cares Its all a big show Its all how youre perceived The most I could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough although that in itself was a small miracle Now I can say youre a heartbreaker Oh oh oh how the boys back home fall longingly at your feet Which do you think will get you more sponsors The smell of wine on his breath makes me sick I shove his hands off my shoulders and step away trying to clear my head Cinna comes over and puts his arm around me Hes right Katniss I dont know what to think I should have been told so I didnt look so stupid No your reaction was perfect If youd known it wouldnt have read as real says Portia Shes just worried about her boyfriend says Peeta gruffly tossing away a bloody piece of the urn My cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale I dont have a boyfriend Whatever says Peeta But I bet hes smart enough to know a bluff when he sees it Besides you didnt say you loved me So what does it matter The words are sinking in My anger fading Im torn now between thinking Ive been used and thinking Ive been given anedge Haymitch is right I survived my interview but what was I really A silly girl spinning in a sparkling dress Giggling The only moment of any substance I hail was when I talked about Prim Compare that with Thresh his silent deadly power and Im forgettable Silly and sparkly and forgettable No not entirely forgettable I have my eleven in training But now Peeta has made me an object of love Not just his To hear him tell it I have many admirers And if the audience really thinks were in love    I remember how strongly they responded to his confession Starcrossed lovers Haymitch is right they eat that stuff up in the Capitol Suddenly Im worried that I didnt react properly After he said he loved me did you think I could be in love with him too I ask I did says Portia The way you avoided looking at the cameras the blush They others chime in agreeing Youre golden sweetheart Youre going to have sponsors lined up around the block says Haymitch Im embarrassed about my reaction I force myself to acknowledge Peeta Im sorry I shoved you Doesnt matter he shrugs Although its technically illegal Are your hands okay I ask Theyll be all right he says In the silence that follows delicious smells of our dinner waft in from the dining room Come on lets eat says Haymitch We all follow him to the table andtake our places But then Peeta is bleeding too heavily and Portialeads him off for medical treatment We start the cream and rosepetal soup without them By the time weve finished theyre back Peetas hands are wrapped in bandages I cant help feeling guilty Tomorrow we will be in the arena He has done me a favor and I have answered with an injury Will I never stop owing him After dinner we watch the replay in the sitting room I seem frilly and shallow twirling and giggling in my dress although the others assure me I am charming Peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love And there I am blushing and confused made beautiful by Cinnas hands desirable by Peetas confession tragic by circumstance and by all accounts unforgettable When the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark a hush falls on the room Tomorrow at dawn we will be roused and prepared for the arena The actual Games dont start until ten because so many of the Capitol residents rise late But Peeta and I must make an early start There is no telling how far we will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this years Games I know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us As soon as they leavehere theyll be at the Games Headquarters hopefully madly signing up our sponsors working out a strategy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us Cinna and Portia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be launched into the arena Still final goodbyes must be said here Effie takes both of us by the hand and with actual tears in her eyes wishes us well Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor And then because its Effie and shes apparently required by law to say something awful she adds I wouldnt be at all surprised if I finally get promoted to a decent district next year Then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out overcome with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement of her fortunes Haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over Any final words of advice asks Peeta When the gong sounds get the hell out of there Youre neither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia Just clear out put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others and find a source of water he says Got it And after that I ask Stay alive says Haymitch Its the same advice he gave us on the train but hes not drunk and laughing this time And we only nod What else is there to say When I head to my room Peeta lingers totalk to Portia Im glad Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can wait until tomorrow My covers are drawn back but there is no sign of the redheaded Avox girl I wish I knew her name I should have asked it She could write it down maybe Or act it out But perhaps that would only result in punishment for her I take a shower and scrub the gold paint the makeup the scent of beauty from my body All that remains of the designteams efforts are the flames on my nails I decide tokeep them as reminder of who I am to the audience Katniss the girl who was on fire Perhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the days to come I pull on a thick fleecy nightgown and climb into bed It takes me about five seconds to realize Ill never fall asleep And I need sleep desperately because in the arena every moment I give in to fatigue will be an invitation to death Its no good One hour two three pass and my eyelids refuse to get heavy I cant stop trying to imagine exactly what terrain Ill be thrown into Desert Swamp A frigid wasteland Above all I am hoping for trees which may afford me some means of concealment and food and shelter Often there are trees because barren landscapes are dull and the Games resolve tooquickly without them But what will the climate be like What traps have the Gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower moments And then there are my fellow tributes    The more anxious I am to find sleep the more it eludes me Finally I am too restless to even stay in bed I pace the floor heart beating too fast breathing too short My room feels like a prison cell If I dont get air soon Im going to start to throw things again I run down the hall to the door to the roof Its not only unlocked but ajar Perhaps someone forgot to close it but it doesnt matter The energy field enclosing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape And Im not looking to escape only to fill my lungs with air I want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me The roof is not lit at night but as soon as my bare feel reach its tiled surface I see his silhouette black against the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol Theres quite a commotion going on down in the streets music and singing and car horns none of which I could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room I could slip away now without him noticing me he wouldnt hear me over the din But the night airs so sweet I cant bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room And what difference does it make Whether we speak ornot My feet move soundlessly across the tiles Im only yard behind him when I say You should be getting some sleep He starts but doesnt turn I can see him give his head a slight shake I didnt want to miss the party Its for us after all I come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail The wide streets are full of dancing people I squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail Are they in costumes Who could tell Peeta answers With all the crazy clothes they wear here Couldnt sleep either Couldnt turn my mind off I say Thinking about your family he asks No I admit a bit guiltily All I can do is wonder about tomorrow Which is pointless of course In the light from below I can see his face now the awkward way he holds his bandaged hands I really am sorry about your hands It doesnt matter Katniss he says Ive never been a contender in theseGames anyway Thats no way to be thinking I say Why not Its true My best hope is to not disgrace myself and    He hesitates And what I say I dont know how to say it exactly Only    I want to die as myself Does that make any sense he asks I shake my head How could he die as anyone but himself I dont want them to changeme in there Turn me into some kind of monster that Im not I bite my lip feeling inferior While Ive been ruminating on the availability of trees Peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity His purity of self Do you mean you wont kill anyone I ask No when the time comes Im sure Ill kill just like everybody else I cant go down without a fight Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to    To show the Capitol they dont own me That Im more than just a piece in their Games says Peeta But youre not I say None of us are Thats how the Games work Okay but within that framework theres still you theres still me he insists Dont you see A little Only    No offense but who cares Peeta I say I do I mean what else am I allowed to care about at this point he asks angrily Hes locked those blue eyes on mine now demanding an answer I take a step back Care about what Haymitch said About staying alive Peeta smiles at me sad and mocking Okay Thanks for the tip sweetheart Its like a slap in the face His use of Haymitchs patronizing endearment Look if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena thats your choice I want to spend mine in District Twelve Wouldnt surprise me if you do says Peeta Give my mother my best when you make it back will youCount on it I say Then I turn and leave the roof I spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze imagining the cutting remarks I will make to Peeta Mellark in the morning Peeta Mellark We will see how high and mighty he is when hes faced with life and death Hell probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes the kind who tries to eat someones heart after theyve killed them There was a guy like that a few years ago from District  called Titus He went completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players hed killed before he ate them There are no rules in the arena but cannibalism doesnt play well with the Capitol audience so they tried to head it off There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic I dont see Peeta in the morning Cinna comes to me before dawn gives me a simple shift to wear and guides me to the roof My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the catacombs under the arena itself A hovercraft appears out of thin air just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the redheaded Avox girl captured and a ladder drops down I place my hands and feet on the lowerrungs and instantly its as if Im frozen Some sort of current glues me to the ladder while Im lifted safely inside I expect the ladder to release me then but Im still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe This is just your tracker Katniss The stiller you are the more efficiently I can place it  she says Still Im a statue But that doesnt prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm Now the Gamemakers will always be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena Wouldnt want to lose a tribute As soon as the trackers in place the ladder releases me The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof An Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out Despite the tension in my stomach I eat as much as I can although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me Im so nervous I could be eating coal dust The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness beyond This is what birds see Only theyre free and safe The very opposite of me The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out suggesting that were nearing the arena The hovercraft lands and Cinna and I go backto the ladder only this time it leads down into a tube underground into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena We follow instructions to my destination a chamber for my preparation In the Capitol they call it the Launch Room In the districts its referred to as the Stockyard The place animals go before slaughter Everything is brandnew I will be the first and only tribute to use this Launch Room The arenas are historic sites preserved after the Games Popular destinations for Capitol residents to visit to vacation Go for a month rewatch the Games tour the catacombs visit the sites where the deaths took place You can even take part in reenactments They say the food is excellent I struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and clean my teeth Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back Then the clothes arrive the same for every tribute Cinna has had no say in my outfit does not even know what will be in the package but he helps me dress in the undergarments simple tawny pants light green blouse sturdy brown belt and thin hooded black jacket that falls to my thighs The material in the jackets designed to reflect body heat Expect some cool nights he says The boots worn over skintight socks are better than I could have hoped for Soft leather not unlike my ones athome These have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though Good for running I think Im finished when Cinna pulls the gold mockingjay pin from his pocket I had completely forgotten about it Where did you get that I ask Off the green outfit you wore on the train he says I remember nowtaking it off my mothers dress pinning it to the shirt Its your district token right I nod and he fastens it on my shirt It barely cleared the review board Some thought the pin could be used as a weapon giving you an unfair advantage But eventually they let it through says Cinna They eliminated a ring from that District One girl though If you twisted the gemstone a spike popped out Poisoned one She claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did But she lost her token There youre all set Move around Make sure everything feels comfortable I walk run in a circle swing my arms about Yes its fine Fits perfectly Then theres nothing to do but wait for the call says Cinna Unless you think you could eat any more I turn down food but accept a glass of water that I take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch I dont want to chew on my nails or lips so Ifind myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek It still hasnt fully healed from a few days ago Soon the taste of blood fills my mouth Nervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is to come I could be dead flatout dead in an hour Not even My fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm where the woman injected the tracking device I press on it even though it hurts I press on it so hard a small bruise begins to form Do you want to talk Katniss Cinna asks I shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to him Cinna encloses it in both of his And this is how we sit until a pleasant female voice announces its time to prepare for launch Still clenching one of Cinnas hands I walk over and stand on the circular metal plate Remember what Haymitch said Run find water The rest will follow he says I nod And remember this Im not allowed to bet but if I could my money would be on you Truly I whisper Truly says Cinna He leans down and kisses me on the forehead Good luck girl on fire And then a glass cylinder is lowering around me breaking our handhold cutting him off from me He taps his fingers under his chin Head high I lift my chin and stand as straight as I can The cylinder begins to rise For maybe fifteen seconds Im in darkness and then I can feel the metal plate pushingme out of the cylinder into the open air For a moment my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight and Im conscious only of a strong wind with the hopeful smell of pine trees Then I hear the legendary announcer Claudius Templesmith as his voice booms all around me Ladies and gentlemen let the Seventyfourth Hunger Games beginSixty seconds Thats how long were required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us Step off before the minute is up and land mines blow your legs off Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high spilling over withthe things that will give us life here in the arena Food containers of water weapons medicine garments fire starters Strewn around the Cornucopia are other supplies their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn For instance only a few steps from my feet lays a threefoot square of plastic Certainly it could be of some use in a downpour But there in the mouth I can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather If I had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twentythree tributes Which I have been instructed not to do Were on a flat open stretch of ground A plain of hardpacked dirt Behind the tributes across from me I can see nothing indicating either a steep downward slope or even cliff To my right lies a lake To my left and back spars piney woods This is where Haymitch would want me to go Immediately I hear his instructions in my head Just clear out put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others and find a source of water But its tempting so tempting when I see the bounty waiting there before me And I know that if I dont get it someone else will That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these lifesustaining spoils Something catches my eye There resting on a mound of blanket rolls is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow already strung just waiting to be engaged Thats mine I think Its meant for me Im fast I can sprint faster than any ofthe girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races But this fortyyard length this is what I am built for I know I can get it I know I can reach it first but then the question is how quickly can I get out of there By the time Ive scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons others will have reached the horn and one or two I might be able to pick off but say theres a dozen at that close range they could take me down with the spears and the clubs Or their own powerful fists Still I wont be the only target Im betting many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl even one who scored an eleven in training to take out their more fierce adversaries Haymitch has never seen me run Maybe if he had hed tell me to go for it Get the weapon Since thats the very weapon that might be my salvation And I only see one bow in that whole pile I know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and I find myself positioning my feet to run not away into the stir rounding forests but toward the pile toward the bow When suddenly I notice Peeta hes about five tributes to my right quite a fair distance still I can tell hes looking at me and I think he might be shaking his head But the suns in my eyes and while Im puzzling over it the gong rings out And Ive missed it Ive missed my chance Because those extra couple of seconds Ive lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in Myfeet shuffle for a moment confused at the direction my brain wants to take and then I lunge forward scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread The pickings are so small and Im so angry with Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because I cant stand leaving with virtually nothing A boy I think from District  reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs splattering my face with blood I stagger back repulsed by the warm sticky spray Then the boy slips to the ground Thats when I see the knife in his back Already other tributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to attack Yes the girl from District  ten yards away running toward me one hand clutching a halfdozen knives Ive seen her throw in training She never misses And Im her next target All the general fear Ive been feeling condenses into at immediate fear of this girl this predator who might kill me in seconds Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling thepack over one shoulder and run fullspeed for the woods I can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head The blade lodges in the pack Both straps on my shoulders now I make for the trees Somehow I know the girl will not pursue me That shell be drawn back into the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone A grin crosses my face Thanks for the knife I think At the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the field About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn Several lie dead already on the ground Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me I continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while For the next few hours I alternate between jogging and walking putting as much distance as I can between myself and my competitors I lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District  but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket I also free the knife its a fine one with a long sharp blade serrated near the handle which will make it handy for sawing through things and slide it into my belt I dont dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet I just keep moving pausing only to check for pursuers I can go a long time I know that from my days in the woods But I will need water That was Haymitchs second instruction and since I sort of botched the first I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it No luck The woods begin to evolve and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees some I recognize some completely foreign to me At one point I hear a noise and pull my knife thinking I may have to defend myself but Ive only startled a rabbit Good to see you I whisper Iftheres one rabbit there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared The ground slopes down I dont particularly like this Valleys make me feel trapped I want to be high like in the hills around District  where I can see my enemies approaching But I have no choice but to keep going Funny though I dont feel too bad The days of gorging myself have paid off Ive got staying power even though Im short on sleep Being in the woods is rejuvenating Im glad for the solitude even though its an illusion because Im probably onscreen right now Not consistently but off and on There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekkingthrough the woods isnt much to look at But theyll show me enough to let people know Im alive uninjured and on the move One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening when the initial casualties come in But that cant compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players Its late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons Each shot represents a dead tribute The fighting must have finally stopped at the Cornucopia They never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed On the opening day they dont even fire the cannons until the initial fightings over because its too hard to keep track of the fatalities I allow myself to pause panting as I count the shots One    Two    Three    On and on until they reach eleven Eleven dead in all Thirteen left to play My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District  coughed into my face Hes gone certainly I wonder about Peeta Has he lasted through the day Ill know in a few hours When they project the deads images into the sky for the rest of us to see All of a sudden Im overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta may be already lost bled white collected and in the process of being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up redressed and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District  No longer hereHeading home I try hard to remember if I saw him once the action started But the last image I can conjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out Maybe its better if hes gone already He had no confidence he could win And I will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him Maybe its better if hes out of this for good I slump down next to my pack exhausted I need to go through it anyway before night falls See what I have to work with As I unhook the straps I can feel its sturdily made although a rather unfortunate color This orange will practically glow in the dark I make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow I flip open the flap What I want most right at this moment is water Haymitchs directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary I wont last long without it For a few days Ill be able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration but after that Ill deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week tops Icarefully lay out the provisions One thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heal A pack of crackers A pack of dried beef strips A bottle of iodine A box of wooden matches A small coil of wire A pair of sunglasses And a halfgallon plasticbottle with a cap for carrying water thats bone dry No water How hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle I become aware of the dryness in my throat and mouth the cracks in my lips Ive been moving all day long Its been hot and Ive sweat a lot I do this at home but there are always streams to drink from or snow to melt if it should come to it As I refill my pack I have an awful thought The lake The one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound What if thats the only water source in the arena That way theyll guarantee drawing us in to fight The lake is a full days journey from where I sit now a much harder journey with nothing to drink And then even if I reach it its sure to be heavily guarded by some of the Career Tributes Im about to panic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier today It has to drink too I just have to find out where Twilight is closing in and I am ill at ease The trees are too thin to offer much concealment The layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when I need their trails to find water And Im still heading downhill deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless Im hungry too but I dont dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet Instead I take my knife and go to work on a pine tree cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark I slowly chew the stuff as I walk along After a week of the finest food in the world its a little hard to choke down But Ive eaten plenty of pine in my life Ill adjust quickly In another hour its clear Ive got to find a place to camp Night creatures are coming out I can hear the occasional hoot or howl my first clue that Ill be competing with natural predators for the rabbits As to whether Ill be viewed as a source of food its too soon to tell There could be any number of animals stalking me at this moment But right now I decide to make my fellow tributes a priority Im sure many will continue hunting through the night Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food an abundance of water from the lake torches or flashlights and weapons theyre itching to use I can only hope Ive traveled far and fast enough to be out of range Before settling down I take my wire and set two twitchup snares in the brush I know its risky to be setting traps but food will go so fast out here And I cant set snares on the run Still I walk another five minutes before making camp I pick my tree carefully A willow not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows offering concealment in those long flowing tresses I climb up sticking to the strongerbranches close tothe trunk and find a sturdy fork for my bed It takes some doing but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner I place my backpack in the foot of the bag then slide in after it As a precaution I remove my belt loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag and refasten it at my waist Now if I roll over in my sleep I wont go crashing to the ground Im small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head but I put on my hood as well As night falls the air is cooling quickly Despite the risk I took in getting the backpack I know now it was the right choice This sleeping bag radiating back and preserving my body heat will be invaluable Im sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep If only I wasnt so thirsty    Night has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap Through the branches I can see the seal of the Capitol which appears to be floating in the sky Im actually viewing another screen an enormous one thats transported by of one of their disappearing hovercraft The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment At home we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing but thats thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes For instance if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone my secret would be revealed to all No here in the arena all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores Simple head shots But now instead of scores they post only district numbers I take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers The first to appear is the girl from District  That means that the Career Tributes from  and  have all survived No surprise there Then the boy from  I didnt expect that one usually all the Careers make it through the first day The boy from District     I guess the foxfaced girl made it Both tributes from  and  The boy from  Both from  Yes theres the boy who I fought for the backpack Ive run through my fingers only one more dead tribute to go Is it Peeta No theres the girl from District  Thats it The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume Im relieved Peetas alive I tell myself again that if I get killed his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most This is what I tellmyself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview The anger at his superiority on the roof The dread that we may come facetoface at any moment in this arena Eleven dead but none from District  I try to work out who is left Five Career Tributes Foxface Thresh and Rue Rue    So she made it through the first day after all I canthelp feeling glad That makes ten of us The other three Ill figure out tomorrow Now when it is dark and I have traveled far and I am nestled high in this tree now I must try and rest I havent really slept in two days and then theres been the long days journey into the arena Slowly I allow my muscles to relax My eyes to close The last thing I think is its lucky I dont snore    Snap The sound of a breaking branch wakes me How long have I been asleep Four hours Five The tip of my nose is icy cold Snap Snap Whats going on This is not the sound of a branch under someones foot but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree Snap Snap I judge it to be several hundred yards to my right Slowly noiselessly I turn myself in that direction For a few minutes theres nothing but blackness and some scuffling Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom A pair of hands warms over flames but I cant make out more than that I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know at the fire starter What are they thinking A fire Ill just at nightfall would have been one thing Those who battled at the Cornucopia with their superior strength and surplus of supplies they couldnt possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then But now when theyve probably been combing the woods for hours looking for victims You might as well be waving a flag and shouting Come and get me And here I am a stones throw from the biggest idiot in the Games Strapped in a tree Not daring to flee since my general location has just been broadcast to any killer who cares I mean I know its cold out here and not everybody has a sleeping bag But then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn I lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really thinking that if I can get out of this tree I wont have the least problem taking out my new neighbor My instinct has been to flee not fight But obviously this persons a hazard Stupid people are dangerous And this one probably doesnt have much in the way of weapons while Ive got this excellent knifeThe sky is still dark but I can feel the first signs of dawn approaching Im beginning to think we meaning the person whose death Im now devising and me we might actually have gone unnoticed Then I hear it Several pairs of feet breaking into a run The fire starter must have dozed off Theyre on her before she can escape I know its a girl now I can tell by the pleading the agonized scream that follows Then theres laughter and congratulations from several voices Someone cries out Twelve down and eleven to go which gets a round of appreciative hoots So theyre fighting in a pack Im not really surprised Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games The strong band together to hunt down the weak then when the tension becomes too great begin to turn on one another I dont have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance Itll be the remaining CareerTributes from Districts   and  Two boys and three girls The ones who lunched together For a moment I hear them checking the girl for supplies I can tell by their comments theyve found nothing good I wonder if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought Shes much too bright to be building a fire like that Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking Im almost certain thats the brutish boy from District  There are murmurs of assent and then to my horror I hear the pack heading toward me They do not know Im here How could they And Im well concealed in the clump of trees At least while the sun stays down Then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble If they just keep moving they will pass me and be gone in a minute But the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree They have flashlights torches I can see an arm here a boot there through the breaks in the branches I turn to stone not even daring to breathe Have they spotted me No not yet I can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere Shouldnt we have heard a cannon by now Id say yes Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately Unless she isnt dead Shes dead I stuck her myself Then wheres the cannon Someone should go back Make sure the jobs done Yeah we dont want to have to track her down twice I said shes dead An argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others Were wasting time Ill go finish her and lets move on I almost fall out of the tree The voice belongs to PeetaThank goodness I had the foresight to belt myself in Ive rolled sideways off the fork and Im facing the ground held in place by the belt one hand and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag braced against the trunk There must have been some rustling when I tipped sideways but the Careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it Go on then Lover Boy says the boy from District  See for yourself I just get a glimpse of Peeta lit by a torch heading back to the girl by the fire His face is swollen with bruises theres a bloody bandage on one arm and from the sound of his gait hes limping somewhat I remember him shaking him his head telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies when all along all along hed planned to throw himself into the thick of things Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid him to do Okay I can stomach that Seeing all those supplies was tempting But this    This other thing This teaming up with the Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us No one from District  would think of doing such a thing Career tributes are overly vicious arrogant better fed but only because theyre the Capitols lapdogs Universally solidly hated by all but those from their own districts I can imagine the things theyre saying about him back home now And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace Obviously the noble boy on the rooftopwas playing just one more game with me But this will be his last I will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his death if I dont kill him first myself The Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot then use hushed voices Why dont we just kill him now and get it over with Let him tag along Whats the harm And hes handy with that knife Is he Thats news What a lot of interesting things Im learning about my friend Peeta today Besides hes our best chance of finding her It takes me a moment to register that the her theyre referring to is me Why You think she bought into that sappy romance stuff She might have Seemed pretty simpleminded to me Every time I think about her spinning around in that dress I want to puke Wish we knew how she got that eleven Bet you Lover Boy knows The sound of Peeta returning silences them Was she dead asks the boy from District  No But she isnow says Peeta Just then the cannon fires Ready to move on The Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to break and birdsong fills the air I remain in my awkward position muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer then hoist myself back onto my branch I need to get down to get going but for a moment I lie there digesting what Ive heard Not only is Peeta with the Careers hes helping them find me The simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because of her eleven Because she can use a bow and arrow Which Peeta knows better than anyone But he hasnt told them yet Is he saving that information because he knows its all that keeps him alive Is he still pretending to love me for the audience What is going on in his head Suddenly the birds fall silent Then one gives a highpitched warning call A single note Just like the one Gale and I heard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught High above the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes A set of huge metal teeth drops down Slowly gently the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft Then it vanishes The birds resume their song Move I whisper to myself I wriggle out of my sleeping bag roll it up and place it in the pack I take a deep breath While Ive been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willowbranches it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me I know they must be tracking me now though The minute I hit the ground Im guaranteed a closeup The audience will have been beside themselves knowing I was in the tree that I overheard the Careers talking that I discovered Peeta was with them Until I work out exactly how I want to play that Id better at least act on top of things Not perplexed Certainly not confused or frightened No I need to look one step ahead of the game So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light I pause a second giving the cameras time to lock on me Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile There Let them figure outwhat that means Im about to take off when I think of my snares Maybe its imprudent to check them with the others so close But have to Too many years of hunting I guess And the lure of possible meat Im rewarded with one fine rabbit In no time Ive cleaned and gutted the animal leaving the head feet tail skin and innards under a pile of leaves Im wishing for a fire eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever a lesson I learned the hard way when I think of the dead tribute I hurryback to her camp Sure enough the coals of her dying fire are still hot I cut up the rabbit fashion a spit out of branches and set it over the coals Im glad for the cameras now I want sponsors to see I can hunt that Im a good bet because I wont be lured into traps as easily as the others will by hunger While the rabbit cooks I grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack The black tones it down but I feel a layer of mud would definitely help Of course to have mud Id need water    I pull on my gear grab my spit kick some dirt over the coals and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went I eat half the rabbit as I go then wrap up the leftovers in my plastic for later The meat stops the grumbling in my stomach but does little to quench my thirst Water is my top priority now As I hike along I feel certain Im still holding the screen in the Capitol so Im careful to continue to hide my emotions But what a good time Claudius Templesmith must be having with his guest commentators dissecting Peetas behavior my reaction What to make of it all Has Peeta revealed his true colors How does this affect the betting odds Will we lose sponsors Do we even have sponsors Yes I feel certain we do or at least did Certainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our starcrossed loverdynamic Or has he Maybe since he hasnt spoken much about me we can still get some mileage out of it Maybe people will think its something we plotted together if I seem like it amuses me now The sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy it seems overly bright I coat my lips in some grease from the rabbit and try to keep from panting but its no use Its only been a day and Im dehydrating fast I try and think of everything I know about finding water It runs downhill so in fact continuing down into this valley isnt a bad thing If I could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation these might help me along but nothing seems to change Theres just the slight gradual slope the birds the sameness to the trees As the day wears on I know Im headed for trouble What little urine Ive been able to pass is a dark brown my head is aching and theres a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to moisten The sun hurts my eyes so I dig out my sunglasses but when I put them on they do something funny to my vision so I just stuff them back in my pack Its late afternoon when I think Ive foundhelp I spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit to suck thesweet juices from the skins But just as Im holding them to my lips I get a hard look at them What I thought were blueberries have a slightly different shape and when I break one open the insides are bloodred I dont recognize these berries perhaps they are edible but Im guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the Gamemakers Even the plant instructor in the Training Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were  percent sure they werent toxic Something I already knew but Im so thirsty it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away Fatigue is beginning to settle on me but its not the usual tiredness that follows a long hike I have to stop and rest frequently although I know the only cure for what ails me requires continued searching I try a new tactic climbing a tree as high as I dare in my shaky state to look for any signs of water But as far as I can see in any direction theres the same unrelenting stretch of forest Determined to go on until nightfall I walk until Im stumbling over my own feet Exhausted I haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in Ive no appetite but I suck on a rabbit bone just to give my mouth something to do Night falls the anthem plays and high in the sky I see the picture of the girl who was apparently from District  The one Peeta wentback to finish off My fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my burning thirst Besides they were heading away from me and by now they too will have to rest With the scarcity of water they may even have had to return to the lake for refills Maybe that is the only course for me as well Morning brings distress My heads throbs with every beat of my heart Simple movements send stabs of pain through my joints I fall rather than jump from the tree It takes several minutes for me to assemble my gear Somewhere inside me I know this is wrong I should be acting with more caution moving with more urgency But my mind seems foggy and forming a plan is hard I lean back against the trunk of my tree one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my tongue as I assess my options How can I get water Return to the lake No good Id never make it Hope for rain Theres not a cloud in the sky Keep looking Yes this is my only chance But then another thought hits me and the surge of anger that follows brings me to me senses Haymitch He could send me water Press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes I know I must have sponsors at least one or two who could afford a pint of liquid for me Yes its pricey but these people theyre made of money And theyllbe betting on me as well Perhaps Haymitch doesnt realize how deep my need is I say in a voice as loud as I dare Water I wait hopefully for a parachute to descend from the sky But nothing is forthcoming Something is wrongAm I deluded about having sponsors Or has Peetas behavior made them all hang back No I dont believe it Theres someone out there who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is refusing to let it go through As my mentor he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors I know he hates me Hes made that clear enough But enough to let me die From this He cant do that can he If a mentor mistreats his tributes hell be held accountable by the viewers by the people back in District  Even Haymitch wouldnt risk that would he Say what you will about my fellow traders in the Hob but I dont think theyd welcome him back there if he let me die this way And then where would he get his liquor So    What Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him Is he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta Is he just too drunk to even notice whats going on at the moment Somehow I dont believe that and I dont believe hes trying to kill me off by neglect either He has in fact in his own unpleasant way genuinely been trying to prepare me for this Then what is going on I bury my face in my hands Theres no danger of tears now I couldnt produce one to save my life What is Haymitch doing Despite my anger hatred and suspicions a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer Maybe hes sending you a message it says A message Saying what Then I know Theres only one good reason Haymitch could be withholding water from me Because he knows Ive almost found it I grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet My backpack seems to have tripled in weight I find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and I start off The suns beating down even more searing than the first two days I feel like an old piece of leather drying and cracking in the heat Every step is an effort but I refuse to stop I refuse to sit down If I sit theres a good chance I wont be able to get up again that I wont even remember my task What easy prey I am Any tribute even tiny Rue could take me right now merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife and Id have little strength to resist But if anyone is in my part of the woods they ignore me The truth is I feel a million miles from another living soul Not alone though No theyve surely got a camera tracking me now I think back tothe years of watching tributes starve freeze bleed and dehydrate to death Unless theres a really good fight going on somewhere Im being featured My thoughts turn to Prim Its likely she wont be watching me live but theyll show updates at the school during lunch For her sake I try to look as least desperate as I can But by afternoon I know the end is coming My legs are shaking and my heart too quick I keep forgetting exactly what Im doing Ive stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain my feet but when the stick slides out from under me I finally tumble to the ground unable to get up I let my eyes close I have misjudged Haymitch He has nointention of helping me at all This is all right I think This is not so bad here The air is less hot signifying evenings approach Theres a slight sweet scent that reminds me of lilies My fingers stroke the smooth ground sliding easily across the top This is an okay place to die I think My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool slippery earth I love mud I think How many times Ive tracked game with the help of its soft readable surface Good for bee stings too Mud Mud Mud My eyes fly open and I dig my fingers into the earth It is mud My nose lifts in the air And those are lilies Pond lilies I crawl now through the mud dragging myself toward the scent Five yards from where I fell I crawl through a tangle of plants into a pond Floating on the top yellow flowers in bloom are my beautiful lilies Its all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as I can hold But I have just enough sense left to abstain With trembling hands I get out my flask and fill it with water I add what I remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it The half an hour of waiting is agony but I do it At least I think its a half an hour but its certainly as long as I can stand Slowly easy now I tell myself I take one swallow and make myself wait Then another Over the next couple of hours I drink the entire half gallon Then a second I prepare another before I retire to a tree where I continue sipping eating rabbit and even indulge in one of my precious crackers By the time the anthem plays I feel remarkably better There are no faces tonight no tributes died today Tomorrow Ill stay here resting camouflaging my backpack with mud catching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice meal I snuggle down in my sleeping bag hanging on to my water bottle for dear life which of course it is A few hours laterthe stampede of feet shakes me from slumber I look around in bewilderment Its not yet dawn but my stinging eyes can see it It would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on meMy first impulse is to scramble from the tree but Im belted in Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall to the ground in a heap still snarled in my sleeping bag Theres no time for any kind of packing Fortunately my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag I shove in the belt hoist the bag over my shoulder and flee The world has transformed to flame and smoke Burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet All I can do is follow the others the rabbits and deer and I even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods I trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine But they are much faster flying through the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs that theres no way I can keep apace with them The heat is horrible but worse than the heat is the smoke which threatens to suffocate me at any moment I pull the top of my shirt up over my nose grateful to find it soaked in sweat and it offers a thin veil of protection And I run choking my bag banging against my back my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning because I know I am supposed to run This was no tributes campfire gone out of control no accidental occurrence The flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height a uniformity that marks them as humanmade machinemade Gamemakermade Things have been too quiet today No deaths perhaps no fights at all The audience in the Capitol will be getting bored claiming that these Games are verging on dullness This is the one thing the Games must not do Its not hard to follow the Gamemakers motivation There is the Career pack and then there are the rest of us probably spread far and thin across the arena This fire is designed to flush us out to drive us together It may not be the most original device Ive seen but its very very effective I hurdle over a burning log Not high enough The tail end of my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames But I dont dare leave the jacket scorched andsmoldering as it is I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag hoping the lack of air will quell what I havent extinguished This is all I have what I carry on my back and its little enough to survive with In a matter of minutes my throat and nose are burning The coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked Discomfort turns to distress until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest I manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the vomiting begins and I lose my meager supper and whatever water has remained in my stomach Crouching on my hands and knees I retch until theres nothing left to come up I know I need to keep moving but Im trembling and lightheaded now gasping for air I allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows from my bottle You get one minute I tell myself One minute to rest I take the time to reorder my supplies wad up the sleeping bag and messily stuff everything into the backpack My minutes up I know its time to move on but the smoke has clouded my thoughts The swiftfooted animals that were my compass have left me behind I know I havent been in this part of the woods before there were no sizable rocks like the one Im sheltering against on my earlier travelsWhere are the Gamemakers driving me Back to the lake To a whole new terrain filled with new dangers I had just found a few hours of peace at the pond when this attack began Would there be any way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there to a source of water at least The wall of fire must have anend and it wont burn indefinitely Not because the Gamemakers couldnt keep it fueled but because again that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience If I could get back behind the fire line I could avoid meeting up with the Careers Ive just decided to try and loop back around although it will require miles of travel away from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head I spring out from under my ledge energized by renewed fear The game has taken a twist The fire was just to get us moving now the audience will get to see some real fun When I hear the next hiss I flatten on the ground not taking time to look The fireball hits a tree off to my left engulfing it in flames To remain still is death Im barely on my feet before the third ball hits the ground where I was lying sending a pillar of fire up behind me Timeloses meaning now as I frantically try to dodge the attacks I cant see where theyre being launched from but its not a hovercraft The angles are not extreme enough Probably this whole segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks Somewhere in a cool and spotless room a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second All that is needed is a direct hit Whatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs Each one is only the size of an apple but packs tremendous power on contact Every sense I have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over Theres no time to judge if a move is the correct one When theres a hiss I act or die Something keeps me moving forward though A lifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain attacks And that if I can just get away from this section I might be able to move out of reach of the launchers I might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers but I cant worry about that now How long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I cant say but the attacks finally begin to abate Which is good because Im retchingagain This time its an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well Im forced to stop as my body convulses trying desperately to rid itself of the poisons Ive been sucking in during the attack I wait for the next hiss the next signal to bolt It doesnt come The force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my stinging eyes My clothes are drenched in sweat Somehow through the smoke and vomit I pick up the scent of singed hair My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it Strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers I stare at them fascinated by the transformation when the hissing registers My muscles react only not fast enoughthis time The fireball crashes into the ground at my side but not before it skids across my right calf Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet shrieking trying to remove myself from the horror When I finally regain enough sense I roll the leg back and forth on the ground which stifles the worst of it But then without thinking I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands I sit on the ground a few yards from the blazeset off by the fireball My calf is screaming my hands covered in red welts Im shaking too hard to move If the Gamemakers want to finish me off now is the time I hear Cinnas voice carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems Katniss the girl who was on fire What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one Perhaps Cinnas beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me I know he couldnt have foreseen this must be hurting for me because in fact I believe he cares about me But all in all maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me The attack is now over The Gamemakers dont want me dead Not yet anyway Everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong The real sport of the Hunger Games is watching the tributes kill one another Every so often they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can But mostly they manipulate us into confronting one another facetoface Which means if I am no longer being fired at there is at least one other tribute close at hand I would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I could but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me I make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky It does not seem to be pursuing me any longer exceptwith its stinking black clouds Another light daylight begins to softly emerge Swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams My visibility is poor I can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction A tribute could easily be concealed from me here I should draw my knife as a precaution but I doubt my ability to hold it for long The pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf I hate burns have always hated them even a small one gotten from pulling a pan of bread from the oven It is the worst kind of pain to me but I have never experienced anything like this Im so weary I dont even notice Im in the pool until Im ankledeep Its springfed bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks and blissfully cool I plunge my hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief Isnt that what my mother always says The first treatment for a burn is cold water That it draws out the heat But she means minor burns Probably shed recommend it for my hands But what of my calf Although I have not yet had the courage to examine it Im guessing that its an injury in a whole different class I lie on my stomach at edge of thepool for a while dangling my hands in the water examining the little flames onmy fingernails that are beginning to chip off Good Ive had enough fire for a lifetime I bathe the blood and ash from my face I try to recall all I know about burns They are common injuries in the Seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal Then there are the mine accidents    A family once brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him The district doctor whos responsible for treating the miners had written him off told the family to take him home to die But they wouldnt accept this He lay on our kitchen table senseless to the world I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh gaping charred flesh burned clear down to the bone before I ran from the house I went to the woods and hunted the entire day haunted by the gruesome leg memories of my fathers death Whats funny was Prim whos scared of her own shadow stayed and helped My mother says healers are born not made They did their best but the man died just like the doctor said he would My leg is in need of attention but I still cant look at it What if its as bad as the mans and I can see my bone Then I remember my mother saying that if a burns severe the victim might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed Encouraged by this I sit up and swing my leg in front of me I almost faintat the sight of my calf The flesh is a brilliant red covered with blisters I force myself to take deep slow breaths feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face I cant show weakness at this injury Not if I want help Pity does not get you aid Admiration at your refusal to give in does I cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely The burned area is about the size of my hand None of the skin is blackened I think its not too bad to soak Gingerly I stretch out my leg into the pool propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesnt get too sodden and sigh because this does offer some relief I know there are herbs if I could find them that would speed the healing but I cant quite call them to mind Water and time will probably be all I have to work with Should I be moving on The smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy If I do continue away from the fire wont I be walking straight into the weapons of the Careers Besides every time I lift my leg from the water the pain rebounds so intensely I have to slide it back in My hands are slightly less demanding They can handle small breaks from the pool So I slowly put my gear back in order First I fill my bottle with the pool water treat it and when enough time has passed begin to rehydrate my body After a timeI force myself to nibble on a cracker which helps settle my stomach I roll up my sleeping bag Except for a few black marks its relatively unscathed My jackets another matter Stinking and scorched at leasta foot of the back beyond repair I cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs But the hoods intact and its far better than nothing Despite the pain drowsiness begins to take over Id take to a tree and try to rest except Id be too easy to spot Besides abandoning my pool seems impossible I neatly arrange my supplies even settle my pack on my shoulders but I cant seem to leave I spot some water plants with edible roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit Sip water Watch the sun make its slow arc across the sky Where would I go anyway that is any safer than here I lean back on my pack overcome by drowsiness If the Careers want me let them find me I think before drifting into a stupor Let them find me And find me they do Its lucky Im ready to move on because when I hear the feet I have less than a minute head start Evening has begun to fall The moment I awake Im up and running splashing across the poolflying into the underbrush My leg slows me down but I sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire either I hear their coughs their raspy voices calling to one another Still they are closing in just like a pack of wild dogs and so I do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances I pick a high tree and begin to climb If running hurt climbing is agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark Im fast though and by the time theyve reached the base of my trunk Im twenty feet up For a moment we stop and survey one another I hope they cant hear the pounding of my heart This could be it I think What chance do I have against them All six are there the five Careers and Peeta and my only consolation is theyre pretty beatup too Even so look at their weapons Look at their faces grinning and snarling at me a sure kill above them It seems pretty hopeless But then something else registers Theyre bigger and stronger than I am no doubt but theyre also heavier Theres a reason its me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit or rob the most remote bird nests I must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest Career Now I smile Hows everything with you I call down cheerfully This takes them aback but I knowthe crowd will love it Well enough says the boy from District  Yourself Its been a bit warm for my taste I say I can almost hear the laughter from the Capitol The airs better up here Why dont you come on up Think I will says the same boy Here take this Cato says the girl from District  and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows My bow My arrows Just the sight of them makes me so angry I want to scream at myself at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from having them I try to make eye contact with him now but he seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his knife with the edgeof his shirt No says Cato pushing away the bow Ill do better with my sword I can see the weapon a short heavy blade at his belt I give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin to climb again Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the way I can scurry up even the slenderest limb Part of its my weight but part of its practice You have to know where to place your hands and feet Im another thirty feet in the air when I hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and a branch go down He hits the ground hard and Im hoping he possibly broke his neckwhen he gets back to his feet swearing like a fiend The girl with the arrows Glimmer I hear someone call her ugh the names the people in District  give their children are so ridiculous anyway Glimmer scales the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop Im at least eighty feet high now She tries to shoot me and its immediately evident that shes incompetent with a bow One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me though and Im able to seize it I wave it teasingly above her head as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it when actually I mean to use it if I ever get the chance I could kill them everyone of them if those silver weapons were in my hands The Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves furious I have made them look foolish But twilight has arrived and their window of attack on me is closing Finally I hear Peeta say harshly Oh let her stay up there Its not like shes going anywhere Well deal with her in the morning Well hes right about one thing Im going nowhere All the relief from the pool water has gone leaving me to feel the full potency of my burns I scoot down to a fork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed Put on my jacket Lay out my sleeping bed Belt myself in and try to keep frommoaning The heat of the bags too much for my leg I cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air I drizzle water on the wound my hands All my bravado is gone Im weak from pain and hunger but cant bring myself to eat Even if I can last the night what will the morning bring I stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest but the burns forbid it Birds are settling down for the night singing lullabies to their young Night creatures emerge An owl hoots The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree a possum maybe catching the firelight from the Careers torches Suddenly Im up on one elbow Those are no possums eyes I know their glassy reflection too well In fact those are not animal eyes at all In the last dim rays of light I make her out watching me silently from between the branches Rue How long has she been here The whole time probably Still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her Perhaps she headed up her treeshortly before I did hearing the pack was so close For a while we hold each others gaze Then without even rustling a leaf her little hand slides into the open andpoints to something above my headMy eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me At first I have no idea what shes pointing to but then about fifteen feet up I make out the vague shape in the dimming light But of    Of what Some sort of animal It looks about the size of a raccoon but it hangs from the bottom of a branch swaying ever so slightly Theres something else Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods my ears register a low hum Then I know Its a wasp nest Fear shoots through me but I have enough sense to keep still After all I dont know what kind of wasp lives there It could be the ordinary leaveusaloneandwellleaveyoualone type But these are the Hunger Games and ordinary isnt the norm More likely they will be one of the Capitols muttations tracker jackers Like the jabberjays these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed like land mines around the districts during the war Larger than regular wasps they have a distinctive solid gold body and asting that raises a lump the size of a plum on contact Most people cant tolerate more than a few stings Some die at once If you live the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness And theres another thing these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and attempt to kill them Thats where the tracker part of the name comes from After the war the Capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding their city but the ones near the districts were left untouched Another reminder of our weakness I suppose just like the Hunger Games Another reason to keep inside the fence of District  When Gale and I come across a tracker jacker nest we immediately head in the opposite direction So is that what hangs above me I look back to Rue for help but shes melted into her tree Given my circumstances I guess it doesnt matter what type of wasp nest it is Im wounded and trapped Darkness has given me a brief reprieve but by the time the sun rises the Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me Theres no way they could do otherwise after Ive made them look so stupid That nest may be the sole option I have left If I can drop it down on them I may be able to escape But Ill risk my life in the process Of course Ill never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest tocut it free Ill have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down The serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that But can my hands And will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm And what if the Careers figure out what Im doing and move their camp That would defeat the whole purpose I realize that the best chance Ill have to do the sawing without drawing notice will be during theanthem That could begin any time I drag myself out of my bag make sure my knife is secured in my belt and begin to make my way up the tree This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me but I persevere When I reach the limb that supports the nest the humming becomes more distinctive But its still oddly subdued if these are tracker jackers Its the smoke I think Its sedated them This was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps The seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem blares out Its now or never I think and begin to saw Blisters burst on my right hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back and forth Once Ive got a groove the work requires less effort but is almostmore than I can handle I grit my teeth and saw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today Thats all right The audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me But the anthems running out and Im only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends the sky goes dark and Im forced to stop Now what I could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan If the wasps are too groggy if the nest catches on its way down if I try to escape this could all be a deadly waste of time Better I think to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies In the faint light of the Careers torches I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise Ive ever had Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute My first gift from a sponsor Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand What can it be Not food surely I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that its medicine Cautiously I probe the surface of the ointment The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes Oh Haymitch I whisper Thank you He has not abandoned me Not left me to fend entirely for myself The cost of this medicine must be astronomical Probablynot one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot To me it is priceless I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf The effect is almost magical erasing the pain on contact leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants its hightech medicine brewed up in the Capitols labs When my calf is treated I rub a thin layer into my hands After wrapping the pot in the parachute I nestle it safely away in my pack Now that the pain has eased its all I can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning In the gray morning light I examine my hands The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft babyskin pink My leg still feels inflamed but that burn was far deeperI apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear Whatever happens Im going to have to move and move fast I also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water Almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday and Im already starting to feel the effects of hunger Below me Ican see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on the ground By her position leaning up against the trunk of the tree Id guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard but fatigue overcame her My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me but I cant make out Rue Since she tipped me off it only seems fair to warn her Besides if Im going to die today its Rue I want to win Even if it means a little extra food for my family the idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable I call Rues name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear wide and alert at once She points up to the nest again I hold up my knife and make a sawing motion She nods and disappears Theres a rustling in a nearby tree Then the same noise again a bit farther off I realize shes leaping from tree to tree Its all I can do not to laugh out loud Is this what she showed the Gamemakers I imagine her flying around the training equipment never touching the floor She should have gotten at least a ten Rosy streaks are breaking through in the east I cant afford to wait any longer Compared to the agony of last nights climb this one is a cinch At the tree limb that holds the nest I position the knife in the groove and Im about to draw the teeth across the wood when I see something moving There on the nest The bright goldgleam of a tracker jacker lazily making its way across the papery gray surface No question its acting a little subdued but the wasp is up and moving and that means the others will be out soon as well Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands beading up through the ointment and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt If I dont get through this branch in a matter of seconds the entire swarm could emerge and attack me Theres no sense in putting it off I take a deep breath grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can Back forth back forth The tracker jackers begin to buzz and I hear them coming out Back forth back forth A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and I know one has found me and the others will be honing in Back forth back forth And just as the knife cuts through I shove the end of the branch as far away from me as I can It crashes down through the lower branches snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground The nest bursts open like an egg and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air I feel a second sting on the cheek a third on my neck and their venom almost immediately makes me woozy I cling to the tree with one arm while I rip the barbed stingers out of my flesh Fortunately only these three tracker jackers hadidentified me before the nest went down The rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground Its mayhem The Careers have woken to a fullscale tracker jacker attack Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything and bolt I can hear cries of To the lake To the lake and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the water It must be close if they think they can outdistance the furious insects Glimmer and another girl the one from District  are not so lucky They receive multiple stings before theyre even out of my view Glimmer appears to go completely mad shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow which is pointless She calls to the others for help but of course no one returns The girl from District  staggers out of sight although I wouldnt bet on her making it to the lake I watch Glimmer fall twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes and then go still The nest is nothing but an empty shell The wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others I dont think theyll return but I dont want to risk it I scamper down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake The poison from the stingers makes me wobbly but I find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water just in case any wasps are still on my trailAfter about five minutes I drag myself onto the rocks People have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker stings Actually the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size A foulsmelling green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out the stingers The swelling The pain The ooze Watching Glimmer twitching to death on the ground Its a lot to handle before the sun has even cleared the horizon I dont want to think about what Glimmer must look like now Her body disfigured Her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow    The bow Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought connects to another and Im on my feet teetering through the trees back to Glimmer The bow The arrows I must get them I havent heard the cannons fire yet so perhaps Glimmer is in some sort of coma her heart still struggling against the wasp venom But once it stops and the cannon signals her death a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body taking the only bow and sheath of arrows Ive seen out of the Games for good And I refuse to let them slip through my fingers again I reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires The tracker jackers have vanished This girl so breathtakingly beautiful in her golden dress the night of the interviews is unrecognizable Her features eradicated herlimbs three times their normal size The stinger lumps have begun to explode spewing putrid green liquid around her I have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow The sheath of arrows is pinned under her back I try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm but the flesh disintegratesin my hands and I fall back on the ground Is this real Or have the hallucinations begun I squeeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth ordering myself not to become sick Breakfast must stay down it might be days before I can hunt again A second cannon fires and Im guessing the girl from District  has just died I hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call which means a hovercraft is about to appear Confused I think its for Glimmer although this doesnt quite make sense because Im still in the picture still fighting for the arrows I lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles In the middle of the sky I spot the hovercraft I throw myself over Glimmers body as if to protect it but then I see the girl from District  being lifted into the air and vanishing Do this I command myself Clenching my jaw I dig my hands underGlimmers body get a hold on what must be her rib cage and force her onto her stomach I cant help it Im hyperventilating now the whole thing is so nightmarish and Im losing my grasp on whats real I tug on the silver sheath of arrows but its caught on something her shoulder blade something and finally yank it free Ive just encircled the sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps several pairs coming through the underbrush and I realize the Careers have come back Theyve come back to kill me or get their weapons or both But its too late to run I pull a slimy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one string I see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive I cant do it I cant do it I cant do it Im helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees spear lifted poised to throw The shock on Peetas face makes no sense to me I wait for the blow Instead his arm drops to his side What are you still doing here he hisses at me I stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under his ear His whole body starts sparkling as if hes been dipped in dew Are you mad Hes prodding me with the shaft of the spear now Get up Get up I rise but hes still pushing at me What What is going on He shoves me away from him hard Run he screams RunBehind him Cato slashes his way through the brush Hes sparkling wet too and badly stung under one eye I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says Holding tightly to my bow and arrows banging into trees that appear out of nowhere tripping and falling as I try to keep my balance Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods The world begins to bend in alarming ways A butterfly balloons to the size of a house then shatters into a million stars Trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I cant shake them free Theyre climbing up my arms my neck Someones screaming a long high pitched scream that never breaks for breath I have a vague ideait might be me I trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest Tucking my knees up to my chin I wait for death Sick and disoriented Im able to form only one thought Peeta Mellark just saved my life Then the ants bore into my eyes and I black out I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me All the things I dread most all the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I cant help but believe theyre real Each time I wake I think At last this is over but it isnt Its only the beginning of a new chapter of torture How many ways do I watch Prim die Relive my fathers last moments Feel my own body ripped apart This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain When I finally do come to my senses I lie still waiting for the next onslaught of imagery But eventually I accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system leaving my body wracked and feeble Im still lying on my side locked in the fetal position I lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound untouched by ants that never existed Simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort So many parts of me hurt it doesnt seem worthwhile taking inventory of them Very very slowly I manage to sit up Im in a shallow hole not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old dead leaves My clothings damp but I dont know whether pond water dew rain or sweat is the cause For a long time all I can do is take tiny sips from my bottleand watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle bush How long have I been out It was morning when I lost reason Now its afternoon But the stiffness in my joints suggests more than a day has passed even two possibly If so Ill have no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker attack Not Glimmer or the girl from District  But there was the boy from District  both tributes from District  and Peeta Did they die from the stings Certainly if they lived their last days must have been as horrid as my own And what about Rue Shes so small it wouldnt take much venom to do her in But then again    The tracker jackers wouldve had to catch her and she had a good head start A foul rotten taste pervades my mouth and the water has little effect on it I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower I gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue The sweetness spreads through my mouth down my throat warming my veins with memories of summer and my home woods and Gales presence beside me For some reason our discussion from that last morning comes back to me We could do it you know What Leave the district Run off Live in the woods You and I we could make it And suddenly Im not thinking ofGale but of Peeta and   Peeta He saved my life I think Because by the time we met up I couldnt tell what was real and what the tracker jacker venom had caused me to imagine But if he did and my instincts tell me he did what for Is he simply working the Lover Boy angle he initiated at the interview Or was he actually trying to protect me And if he was what was he doing with those Careers in the first place None of it makes sense I wonder what Gale made of the incident for a moment and then I push the whole thing out of my mind because for some reason Gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my thoughts So I focus on the one really good thing thats happened since I landed in the arena I have a bow and arrows A full dozen arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree They bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from Glimmers body which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them I can clean them later but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home but who cares That I can work with Theweapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games I know I have tough opponents left to face But I am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures If Cato broke through the trees right now I wouldnt flee Id shoot I find Im actually anticipating the moment with pleasure But first I have to get some strength back in my body Im very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously low The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the Capitol is gone plus several more pounds as well My hip bones and ribs are more prominent than I remember them being since those awful months after my fathers death And then there are my wounds to contend with burns cuts and bruises from smashing into the trees and three tracker jacker stings which are as sore and swollen as ever I treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well but it has no effect on them My mother knew a treatment for them some type of leaf that could draw out the poison but she seldom had cause to use it and I dont even remember its name let alone its appearance Water first I think You can hunt along the way now Its easy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruction my crazed body made through the foliage So I walk off in the otherdirection hoping my enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker jacker venom I cant move too quickly my joints reject any abrupt motions But I establish the slow hunters tread I use when tracking game Within a few minutes I spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow Its not my usual clean shot through the eye but Ill take it After about an hour I find a stream shallow but wide and more than sufficient for my needs The suns hot and severe so while Iwait for my water to purify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into the mild current Im filthy from head to toe I try splashing myself but eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit untangling my hair with my fingers My appetite returns and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef With a handful of moss I polish the blood from my silver weapons Refreshed I treat my burns again braid back my hair and dress in the damp clothes knowing the sun will dry them soon enough Following the stream against its current seems the smartest course ofaction Im traveling uphill now which I prefer with a source of fresh water not only for myself but possible game I easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey Anyway it looks plenty edible to me By late afternoon I decide to build a small fire to cook the meat betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and I can quench the fire by nightfall I clean the game taking extra care with the bird but theres nothing alarming about it Once the feathers are plucked its no bigger than a chicken but its plump and firm Ive just placed the first lot over the coals when I hear the twig snap In one motion I turn to the sound bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder Theres no one there No one I can see anyway Then I spot the tip of a childs boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree My shoulders relax and I grin She can move through the woods like a shadow you have to give her that How else could she have followed me The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them You know theyre not the only ones who can form alliances I say For a moment no response Then one of Rues eyes edges around the trunk You want me for an ally Why not You saved me with those tracker jackers Youre smart enough to still be alive And I cant seem to shake you anyway I say She blinks at metrying to decide You hungry I can see her swallow hard her eye flickering to the meat Come on then Ive had two kills today Rue tentatively steps out into the open I can fix your stings Can you I ask How She digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves Im almost certain theyre the ones my mother uses Whered you find those Just around We all carry them when we work in the orchards They left a lot of nests there says Rue There are a lot here too Thats right Youre District Eleven Agriculture I say Orchards huh That must be how you can fly around the trees like youve got wings Rue smiles Ive landed on one of the few things shell admit pride in Well come on then Fix me up I plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee To my surprise Rue places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chewthem My mother would use other methods but its not like we have a lot of options After a minute or so Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee Ohhh The sound comes out of my mouth before I can stop it Its as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting Rue gives a giggleLucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or youd be a lot worse Do my neck Do my cheek I almost beg Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth and soon Im laughing because the relief is so sweet I notice a long burn on Rues forearm Ive got something for that I set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine You have good sponsors she says longingly Have you gotten anything yet I ask She shakes her head You will though Watch The closer we get to the end the more people will realize how clever you are I turn the meat over You werent joking about wanting me for an ally she asks No I meant it I say I can almost hear Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child But I want her Because shes a survivor and I trust her and why not admit it She reminds me of Prim Okay she says and holds out her hand We shake Its a deal Of course this kind of deal can only be temporary but neither of us mentions that Rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root to the meal Roasted over the fire they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip She recognizes the bird too some wild thing they call a groosling in her district She says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day For a while all conversation stops aswe fill our stomachs The groosling has delicious meal thats so fatty the grease drips down your face when you bite into it Oh says Rue with a sigh Ive never had a whole leg to myself before Ill bet she hasnt Ill bet meat hardly ever comes her way Take the other I say Really she asks Take whatever you want Now that Ive got a bow and arrows I can get more Plus Ive got snares I can show you how to set them I say Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg Oh take it I say putting the drumstick in her hands It will only keep a few days anyway and weve got the whole bird plus the rabbit Once shes got hold of it her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful Id have thought in District Eleven youd have a bit more to eat than us You know since you grow the food I say Rues eyes widen Oh no were not allowed to eat the crops They arrest you or something I ask They whip you and make everyone else watch says Rue The mayors very strict about it I can tell by her expression that its not that uncommon an occurrence A public whippings a rare thing in District  although occasionally one occurs Technically Gale and I could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods well technically we could get a whole lot worse except all the officials buy our meat Besides ourmayor Madges father doesnt seem to have much taste for such events Maybe being the least prestigious poorest most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages Such as being largely ignored by the Capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas Do you get all the coal you want Rue asks No I answer Just what we buy and whatever we track in on our boots They feed us a bit extra during harvest so that people can keep going longer says Rue Dont you have to be in school I ask Not during harvest Everyone works then says Rue Its interesting hearing about her life We have so little communication with anyone outside our district In fact I wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out our conversation because even though the information seems harmless they dont want people in different districts to know about one another At Rues suggestion we lay out all our food to plan ahead Shes seen most of mine but I add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile Shes gathered quite a collection of roots nuts greens and even some berries I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers You sure this is safe Oh yes we have them back home Ive been eating them for days she says popping a handful in her mouth I tentatively bite into one and its as good as our blackberries Taking Rue on as an allyseems a better choice all the time We divide up our food supplies so in case were separated well both be set for a few days Apart from the food Rue has a small water skin a homemade slingshot and an extra pair of socks She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife I know its not much she says as if embarrassed but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast You did just right I say When I spread out my gear she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses How did you get those she asks In my pack Theyve been useless so far They dont block the sun and they make it harder to see I say with a shrug These arent for sun theyre for darkness exclaims Rue Sometimes when we harvest through the night theyll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees Where the torchlight doesnt reach One time this boy Martin he tried to keep his pair Hid it in his pants They killed him on the spot They killed a boy for taking these I say Yes and everyone knew he was no danger Martin wasnt right in the head I mean he still acted like a threeyearold He just wanted the glasses to play with says Rue Hearing this makes me feel like District  is some sort of safe haven Of course people keel over from starvation all the time but I cant imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child Theres a littlegirl one of Greasy Saes grandkids who wanders around the Hob Shes not quite right but shes treated as a sort of pet People toss her scraps and things So what do these do I ask Rue taking the glasses They let you see in complete darkness says Rue Try them tonight when the sun goesdown I give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again We extinguish our fire and head upstream until its almost nightfall Where do you sleep I ask her In the trees She nods In just your jacket Rue holds up her extra pair of socks I have these for my hands I think of how cold the nights have been You can share my sleeping bag if you want Well both easily fit Her face lights up I can tell this is more than she dared hope for We pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play There were no deaths today Rue I only woke up today How many nights did I miss The anthem should block out our words but still I whisper I even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand I dont want the audience to know what Im planning to tell her about Peeta Taking a cue from me she does the same Two she says Thegirls from Districts One and Four are dead Theres ten of us left Something strange happened At least I think it did It might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine things I say You know the boy from my district Peeta I think he saved my life But he was with the Careers Hes not with them now she says Ive spied on their base camp by the lake They made it back before they collapsed from the stingers But hes not there Maybe he did save you and had to run I dont answer If in fact Peeta did save me Im in his debt again And this cant be paid back If he did it was all probably just part of his act You know to make people think hes in love with me Oh says Rue thoughtfully I didnt think that was an act Course it is I say He worked it out with our mentor The anthem ends and the sky goes dark Lets try out these glasses I pull out the glasses and slip them on Rue wasnt kidding I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away I could kill it from here if I had a mind to I could kill anyone I wonder who else got a pair of these I say The Careers have two pairs But theyve got everything down by the lake Rue says And theyre so strong Were strong too I say Just in a different way You are You can shoot she says What can I do You can feedyourself Can they I ask They dont need to They have all those supplies Rue says Say they didnt Say the supplies were gone How long would they last I say I mean its the Hunger Games right But Katniss theyre not hungry says Rue No theyre not Thats the problem I agree And for the first time I have a plan A plan that isnt motivated by the need for flight and evasion An offensive plan I think were going to have to fix that RueRue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up against me and falls asleep Nor do I have any misgivings about her as I take no particular precautions If shed wanted me dead all shewould have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest Needling me at the very back of my mind is the obvious Both of us cant win these Games But since the odds are still against either of us surviving I manage to ignore the thought Besides Im distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies Somehow Rue and I must find a way to destroy their food Im pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle Traditionally the Career tributes strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there The years when they have not protected it well one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it another a Gamemakers flood washed it away those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won That the Careers have been better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage because they dont know how to be hungry Not the way Rue and I do But Im too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight My wounds recovering my mind still a bit foggy from the venom and the warmth of Rue at my side her head cradled on my shoulder have given me a sense of security I realize for the first time how very lonely Ive been in the arena How comforting the presence of another human being can be I give in to my drowsiness resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn Tomorrow its the Careers who will have to watch their backs The boom of the cannon jolts me awakeThe skys streaked with light the birds already chattering Rue perches in a branch across from me her hands cupping something We wait listening for more shots but there arent any Who do you think that was I cant help thinking of Peeta I dont know It could have been any of the others says Rue I guess well know tonight Whos left again I ask The boy from District One Both tributes from Two The boy from Three Thresh and me And you and Peeta says Rue Thats eight Wait and the boy from Ten the one with the bad leg He makes nine Theres someone else but neither of us can remember who it is I wonder how that last one died says Rue No telling But its good for us A death should hold the crowd for a bit Maybe well have time to do something before the Gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly I say Whats in your hands Breakfast says Rue She holds them out revealing two big eggs What kind are those I ask Not sure Theres a marshy area over that way Some kind of waterbird she says Itd be nice to cook them but neither of us wants to risk a fire My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the Careers which means theyve recovered enough to be back in the Games We each suck out the insides of an egg eat a rabbit leg and some berries Its a good breakfast anywhere Ready to do it I say pulling on my pack Do what says Rue but by the way she bounces up you can tell shes up for whatever I propose Today we take out the Careers food I say ReallyHow You can see the glint of excitement in her eyes In this way shes exactly the opposite of Prim for whom adventures are an ordeal No idea Come on well figure out a plan while we hunt I say We dont get much hunting done though because Im too busy getting every scrap of information I can out of Rue about the Careers base Shes only been in to spy on them briefly but shes observant They have set up their camp beside the lake Their supply stash is about thirty yards away During the day theyve been leaving another tribute the boy from District  to watch over the supplies The boy from District Three I ask Hes working with them Yes he stays at the camp fulltime He got stung too when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake says Rue I guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard But hes not very big What weapons does he have I ask Not much that I could see A spear He might be able to hold a few of us off with that but Thresh could killhim easily says Rue And the foods just out in the open I say She nods Somethings not quite right about that whole setup I know But I couldnt tell what exactly says Rue Katniss even if you could get to the food how would you get rid of it Burn it Dump it in the lake Soak it in fuel I poke Rue in the belly just like I would Prim Eat it She giggles Dont worry Ill think of something Destroying things is much easier than making them For a while we dig roots we gather berries and greens we devise a strategy in hushed voices And I come to know Rue the oldest of six kids fiercely protective of her siblings who gives her rations to the younger ones who forages in the meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours Rue who when you ask her what she loves most in the world replies of all things Music Music I say In our world I rank music somewhere between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness At least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather You have a lot of time for that We sing at home At work too Thats why I love your pin she says pointing to the mockingjay that Ive again forgotten about You have mockingjays I ask Oh yes I have a few that are my special friends We can sing back and forth for hours They carry messages for me she says What do you mean I say Im usually up highest so Im the first to see the flag that signals quitting time Theres a special little song I do says Rue She opens her mouth and sings a little fournote run in a sweet clear voice And the mockingjays spread it around the orchard Thats how everyone knows to knock off she continues They can be dangerous though if you get too near their nests But you cant blame them for that I unclasp the pin and hold it out to her Here you take it It has more meaning for you than me Oh no says Rue closing my fingers back over the pin I like to see it on you Thats how I decided I could trust youBesides I have this She pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt On it hangs a roughly carved wooden star Or maybe its a flower Its a good luck charm Well its worked so far I say pinning the mockingjay back on my shirt Maybe you should just stick with that By lunch we have a plan By early afternoon we are poised to carry it out I help Rue collect and place the wood for the first two campfires the third shell have time for on her own We decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first meal together The stream should help guide me backto it Before I leave I make sure Rues well stocked with food and matches I even insist she take my sleeping bag in case its not possible to rendezvous by nightfall What about you Wont you be cold she asks Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake I say You know stealing isnt illegal here I say with a grin At the last minute Rue decides to teach me her mockingjay signal the one she gives to indicate the days work is done It might not work But if you hear the mockingjays singing it youll know Im okay only I cant get back right away Are there many mockingjays here I ask Havent you seen them Theyve got nests everywhere she says I have to admit I havent noticed Okay then If all goes according to plan Ill see you for dinner I say Unexpectedly Rue throws her arms around me I only hesitate a moment before I hug her back You be careful she says to me You too I say I turn and head back to the stream feeling somehow worried About Rue being killed about Rue not being killed and the two of us being left for last about leaving Rue alone about leaving Prim alone back home No Prim has my mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she wont go hungry Rue has only me Once I reach the stream I have only to follow it downhill to the place I initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack I have to be cautious as I move along the water though because I find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions most of which concern Peeta The cannon that fired early this morning did that signify his death If so how did he die At the hand of a Career And was that in revenge for letting me live I struggle again to remember that moment over Glimmers body when he burst through the trees But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened I must have been moving very slowly yesterday because I reach the shallow stretch where I took my bath in just a few hours I stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to my backpack It seems bent on reverting to orange no matter how many times I cover it My proximity to the Careers camp sharpens my senses and the closer I get to them the more guarded I am pausing frequently to listen for unnatural sounds an arrow already fitted into the string of my bow I dont see any other tributes but I do notice some of the things Rue has mentionedPatches of the sweet berries A bush with the leaves that healed my stings Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in And hereand there the blackandwhite flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head When I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot I pause a moment to gather my courage Rue has given specific instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the lake from this point Remember I tell myself Youre the hunter now not them I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on I make it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to admire her cleverness Its right at the edge of the wood but the bushy foliage is so thick down low I can easily observe the Career camp without being spotted Between us lies the flat expanse where the Games began There are four tributes The boy from District  Cato and the girl from District  and a scrawny ashenskinned boy who must be from District  He made almost no impression on me at all during our time in the Capitol I can remember almost nothing about him not his costume not his training score not his interview Even now as he sits there fiddling with some kind of plastic box hes easily ignored in the presence of his large and domineering companions But he must be of some value or they wouldnt have bothered to let him live Still seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over why the Careers would possibly leave him as a guard why they have allowed him to live at all All four tributes seem to still be recovering from the tracker jacker attack Even from here I can see the large swollen lumps on their bodies They must not have had the sense to remove the stingers or if they did not known about the leaves that healed them Apparently whatever medicines they found in the Cornucopia have been ineffective The Cornucopia sits in its original position but its insides have been picked clean Most of the supplies held in crates burlap sacks and plastic bins are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp Others are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the onset of the Games A canopy of netting that aside from discouraging birds seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself The whole setup is completely perplexing The distance the netting and the presence of the boy from District  One things for sure destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks Some other factor is at play here and Id better stay put until I figure out what it is My guess is the pyramid is boobytrapped in some manner I think of concealed pits descending nets a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart Really thepossibilities are endless While I am mulling over my options I hear Cato shout out Hes pointing up to the woods far beyond me and without turning I knowthat Rue must have set the first campfire Wed made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable The Careers begin to arm themselves at once An argument breaks out Its loud enough for me to hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from District  should stay or accompany them Hes coming We need him in the woods and his jobs done here anyway No one can touch those supplies says Cato What about Lover Boy says the boy from District  I keep telling you forget about him I know where I cut him Its a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet At any rate hes in no shape to raid us says Cato So Peeta is out there in the woods wounded badly But I am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the Careers Come on says Cato He thrusts a spear into the hands of the boy from District  and they head off in the direction of the fire The last thing I hear as they enter the woods is Cato saying When we find her I kill her in my own way and no one interferes Somehow I dont think hes talking about Rue She didnt drop a nest of acker jackers on him I stay put for a half an hour or so trying to figure out what to do about the supplies The one advantage I have with the bow and arrow is distance I could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough Im a good enough shot to get it through those openings in the net but theres no guarantee it would catch More likely itd just burn itself out and then what Id have achieved nothing and given them far too much information about myself That I was here that I have an accomplice that I can use the bow and arrow with accuracy Theres no alternative Im going to have to get in closer and see if I cant discover what exactly protects the supplies In fact Im just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye Several hundred yards to my right I see someone emerge from the woods For a second I think its Rue but then I recognize Foxface shes the one we couldnt remember this morning creeping out onto the plain When she decides its safe she runs for the pyramid with quick small steps Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid she stops searches the ground and carefully places her feet on a spot Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops sometimes landing on one foot teetering slightlysometimes risking a few steps At one point she launches up in the air over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes But she overshot slightly and her momentum throws her forward I hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground but nothing happens In a moment shes regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies So Im right about the booby trap but its clearly more complex than I had imagined I was right about the girl too How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly She fills herpack taking a few items from a variety of containers crackers from a crate a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin But only a handful from each not enough to tip off that the food is missing Not enough to cause suspicion And then shes doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again safe and sound I realize Im grinding my teeth in frustration Foxface has confirmed what Id already guessed But what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity Has so many trigger points Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth Youd have thought    And slowly it begins to dawn on me    Youd have thought the very ground was going to explode Its mined I whisper That explains everything The Careers willingness to leave their supplies Foxfaces reaction the involvement of the boy from District  where they have the factories where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives But where did he get them In the supplies Thats not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena The ground around it has been dug up and patted back down The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates but the boy from District  must have managed to reactivate them Ive never seen anyone in the Games do that I bet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers Well hurray for the boy from District  for putting one over on them but what am I supposed to do now Obviously I cant go strolling into that mess without blowing myself skyhigh As for sending in a burning arrow thats more laughable than ever The mines are set off by pressure It doesnt have to be a lot either One year a girldropped her token a small wooden ball while she was at her plate and they literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground My arms pretty good I might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what Maybe one mine That could start a chain reaction Or could it Would the boy from District  have placed the mines in such a way that a single mine would not disturb the others Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader Even if I only blew up one mine Id draw the Careers back down on me for sure And anyway what am I thinking Theres that net clearly strung to deflect any such attack Besides what Id really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once setting off a big chain reaction demolishing the whole lot I glance back up at the woods The smoke from Rues second fire is wafting toward the sky By now the Careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick Time is running out There is a solution to this I know there is if I can only focus hard enough I stare at the pyramid thebins the crates too heavy to topple over with an arrow Maybe one contains cooking oil and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could end uplosing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin since Id just be guessing Im genuinely thinking of trying to recreate Foxfaces trip up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples I could sever the rope in one shot didnt I do as much in the Training Center Its a big bag but it still might only be good for one explosion If only I could free the apples themselves    I know what to do I move into range and give myself three arrows to get the job done I place my feet carefully block out the rest of the world as I take meticulous aim The first arrow tears through the side of the bag near the top leaving a split in the burlap The second widens it to a gaping hole I can see the first apple teetering when I let the third arrow go catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag For a moment everything seems frozen in time Then the apples spill to the ground and Im blown backward into the airThe impact with the hardpacked earth of the plain knocks the wind out of meMy backpack does little to soften the blow Fortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow sparing both itself and my shoulder and my bow is locked in my grasp The ground still shakes with explosions I cant hear them I cant hear anything at the moment But the apples must have set off enough mines causing debris to activate the others I manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter some of it burning rain down around me An acrid smoke fills the air which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe After about a minute the ground stops vibrating I roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid The Careers arent likely to salvage anything out of that Id better get out of here I think Theyll be making a beeline for the place But once Im on my feet I realize escape may not be so simple Im dizzy Not the slightly wobbly kind but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the earth to move in waves under your feet I take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and knees I wait a few minutes to let it pass but it doesnt Panic begins to set in I cant stay here Flight is essential But I can neither walk nor hear I place a hand to my left ear theone that was turned toward the blast and it comes away bloody Have I gone deaf from the explosion The idea frightens me I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter maybe more at times But I cant let my fear show Absolutely positively I am live on every screen in Panem No blood trails I tell myself and manage to pull my hood up over my head tie the cord under my chin with uncooperativefingers That should help soak up the blood I cant walk but can I crawl I move forward tentatively Yes if I go very slowly I can crawl Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover My only hope is to make it back to Rues copse and conceal myself in greenery I cant get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open Not only will I face death its sure to be a long and painful one at Catos hand The thought of Prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout Another blast knocks me flat on my face A stray mine set off by some collapsing crate This happens twice more Im reminded of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and I pop corn over the fire at home To say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement I have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes atthe base of the trees when theres Cato barreling onto the plain soon followed by his companions His rage is so extreme it might be comical so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists if I didnt know that it was aimed at me at what I have done to him Add to that my proximity my inability to run or defend myself and in fact the whole thing has me terrified Im glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because Im biting my nails like theres no tomorrow Gnawing off the last bits of nail polish trying to keep my teeth from chattering The boy from District  throws stones into the ruins and must have declared all the mines activated because the Careers are approaching the wreckage Cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers The other tributes are poking around in the mess looking for anything to salvage but theres nothing The boy from District  has done his job too well This idea must occur to Cato too because he turns on the boy and appears to be shouting at him The boy from District  only has time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind I can see the muscles ripple in Catos arms as he sharply jerks the boys head to the sideIts that quick The death of the boy from District  The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down I can tell he wants to return to the woods but they keep pointing at the sky which puzzles me until I realize Of course They think whoever set off the explosions is dead They dont know about the arrows and the apples They assume the booby trap was faulty but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it If there was a cannon shot it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from District  And they wait I suppose a cannon goes off A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy The sun dips belowthe horizon Night falls Up in the sky I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun A moment of darkness They show the boy from District  They show the boy from District  who must have died this morning Then the seal reappears So now they know The bomber survived In the seals light I can see Cato and the girl from District  put on their nightvision glasses The boy from District  ignites atree branch for a torch illuminating the grim determination on all their faces The Careers stride back into the woods to hunt The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deafened I can hear a ringing in my right which seems a good sign Theres no point in leaving my hiding place though Im about as safe as I can be here at the crime scene They probably think the bomber has a two or threehour lead on them Still its a long time before I risk moving The first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them on which relaxes me a little to have at least one of my hunters senses working I drink some water and wash the blood from my ear Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators fresh blood is bad enough I make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered today Where is my little ally Did she make it back to the rendezvous point Is she worried about me At least the sky has shown were both alive I run through the surviving tributes on my fingers The boy from  both from  Foxface both from  and  Just eight of us The betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol Theyll be doing special features on each of us now Probably interviewing our friends and families Its been a long time since a tribute from District  made it into the top eight And now there are twoof us Although from what Cato said Peetas on his way out Not that Cato is the final word on anything Didnt he just lose his entire stash of supplies Let the Seventyfourth Hunger Games begin Cato I think Let them begin for real A cold breeze has sprung up I reach for my sleeping bag before I remember I left it with Rue I was supposed to pick up another one but what with the mines and all I forgot I begin to shiver Since roosting overnight in a tree isnt sensible anyway I scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself with leaves and pine needles Im still freezing I lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind Its a little better I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from District  that lit the fire that first night But now its me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning More leaves more pine needles I pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest Somehow I drift off to sleep When I open my eyes the world looks slightly fractured and it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my vision As I sit up and remove them I hear a laugh somewhere nearthe lake and freeze The laughs distorted but the fact that it registered at all means I must be regaining my hearing Yes my right ear can hear again although its still ringing As for my left ear well at least the bleeding has stopped I peer through the bushes afraid the Careers have returned trapping me here for an indefinite time No its Foxface standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing Shes smarter than the Careers actually finding a few useful items in the ashes A metal pot A knife blade Im perplexed by her amusement until I realize that with the Careers stores eliminated she might actually stand a chance Just like the rest of us It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack But I rule it out Theres something about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back With that in mind this might be an excellent time to shoot her But shes heard something not me because her head turns away toward the dropoff and she sprints for the woods I wait No one nothing shows up Still if Foxface thought it was dangerous maybe its time for me to get out of here too Besides Im eager to tell Rue about the pyramid Since Ive no idea where the Careers are the route back by the stream seems as good as any Ihurry loaded bow in one hand a hunk of cold groosling in the other because Im famished now and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the meat The trip to the stream is uneventful Once there I refill my water and wash taking particular care with my injured ear Then I travel uphill using the stream as a guide At one point I find boot prints in the mud along the bank The Careers have been here but not for a while The prints are deep because they were made in soft mud but now theyre nearly dry in the hot sun I havent been careful enough about my own tracks counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints Now I strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream The cool water has an invigorating effect on my body my spirits I shoot two fish easy pickings in this slowmoving stream and go ahead and eat one raw even though Ive just had the groosling The second Ill save for Rue Gradually subtly the ringing in my right ear diminishes until its gone entirely I find myself pawing at my left ear periodically trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds If theres improvement its undetectable I cant adjust to deafness in the ear It makes me feel offbalanced and defenseless to my left Blind even My head keeps turning tothe injured side as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant flow of information The more time that passes the less hopeful I am that this is an injury that will heal When I reach the site of our first meeting I feel certain its beenundisturbed Theres no sign of Rue not on the ground or in the trees This is odd By now she should have returned as its midday Undoubtedly she spent the night in a tree somewhere What else could she do with no light and the Careers with their nightvision glasses tramping around the woods And the third fire she was supposed to set although I forgot to check for it last night was the farthest from our site of all Shes probably just being cautious about making her way back I wish shed hurry because I dont want to hang around here too long I want to spend the afternoon traveling to higher ground hunting as we go But theres nothing really for me to do but wait I wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my evergrowing list of wounds The burns are much better but I use a bit of medicine on them anyway The main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection I go ahead andeat the second fish It isnt going to last long in this hot sun but it should be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue If she would just show up Feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided hearing I scale a tree to wait If the Careers show up this will be a fine place to shoot them from The sun moves slowly I do things to pass the time Chew leaves and apply them to my stings that are deflated but still tender Comb through my damp hair with my fingers and braid it Lace my boots back up Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows Test my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it but without good results Despite the groosling and the fish my stomachs growling and I know Im going to have what we call a hollow day back in District  Thats a day where no matter what you put in your belly its never enough Having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse so I decide to give into it After all Ive lost a lot of weight in the arena I need some extra calories And having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident about my future prospects I slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts My last cracker The groosling neck Thats good because it takes time to pick clean Finally a groosling wing and the bird is history But its a hollow day and even with all that I start daydreaming about foodParticularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol The chicken in creamy orange sauce The cakes and pudding Bread with butter Noodles in green sauce The lamb and dried plum stew I suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get over it Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over Sort of Dangling up in the tree with the sun warming me a mouthful of mint my bow and arrows at hand    This is the most relaxed Ive been since Ive entered the arena If only Rue would show up and we could clear out As the shadows grow so does my restlessness By late afternoon Ive resolved to go looking for her I can at least visit the spotwhere she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts Before I go I scatter a few mint leaves around our old campfire Since we gathered these some distance away Rue will understand Ive been here while theyll mean nothing to the Careers In less than an hour Im at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and I know something has gone amiss The wood has been neatly arranged expertly interspersed with tinder but it has never been lit Rue set up thefire but never made it back here Somewhere between the second column of smoke I spied before I blew up the supplies and this point she ran into trouble I have to remind myself shes still alive Or is she Could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up Will she appear in the sky tonight No I refuse to believe it There could be a hundred other explanations She could have lost her way Run into a pack of predators or another tribute like Thresh and had to hide Whatever happened Im almost certain shes stuck out there somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet Something is keeping her up a tree I think Ill go hunt it down Its a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon I creep silently through the shadows letting them conceal me But nothing seems suspicious Theres no sign of any kind of struggle no disruption of the needles on the ground Ive stopped for just a moment when I hear it I have to cock my head around to the side to be sure but there it is again Rues fournote tune coming out of a mockingjays mouth The one that means shes all right I grin and move in the direction of the bird Another just a short distance ahead picks up on the handful of notes Rue has beensinging to them and recently Otherwise theyd have taken up some other song My eyes lift up into the trees searching for a sign of her I swallow and sing softly back hoping shell know its safe to join me A mockingjay repeats the melody to me And thats when I hear the scream Its a childs scream a young girls scream theres no one in the arena capable of making that sound except Rue And now Im running knowing this may be a trap knowing the three Careers may be poised to attack me but I cant help myself Theres another highpitched cry this time my name Katniss Katniss Rue I shout back so she knows Im near So they know Im near and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still cant explain will be enough to pull their attention away from her Rue Im coming When I break into the clearing shes on the ground hopelessly entangled in a net She just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her bodyThe boy from District  dies before he can pull out the spear My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck He falls to his knees andhalves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood Im reloaded shifting my aim from side to side while I shout at Rue Are there more Are there more She has to say no several times before I hear it Rue has rolled to her side her body curved in and around the spear I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife freeing her from the net One look at the wound and I know its far beyond my capacity to heal beyond anyones probably The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach I crouch before her staring helplessly at the embedded weapon Theres no point in comforting words in telling her shell be all right Shes no fool Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline As if its me whos dying instead of Rue You blew up the food she whispers Every last bit I say You have to win she says Im going to Going to win for both of us now I promise I hear a cannon and look up It must be for the boy from District  Dont go Rue tightens her grip on my hand Course not Staying right here I say I move in closerto her pulling her head onto my lap I gently brush the dark thick hair back behind her ear Sing she says but I barely catch the word Sing I think Sing what I do know a few songs Believe it or not there was once music in my house too Music I helped make My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice but I havent sung much since he died Except when Prim is very sick Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby Sing My throat is tight with tears hoarse from smoke and fatigue But if this is Prims I mean Rues last request I have to at least try The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby one we sing fretful hungry babies to sleep with Its old very old I think Made up long ago in our hills What my music teacher calls a mountain air But the words are easy and soothing promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today I give a small cough swallow hard and beginDeep in the meadow under the willowA bed of grass a soft green pillowLay down your head and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open the sun will riseHere its safe here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love youRues eyes have fluttered shut Her chest moves but only slightly My throat releases the tears and they slide down my cheeks But I have to finish the song for herDeep in the meadow hidden far awayA cloak of leaves a moonbeam rayForget your woes and let your troubles layAnd when again its morning theyll wash awayHere its safe here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmThe final lines are barely audibleHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love youEverythings still and quiet Then almost eerily the mockingjays take up my song For a moment I sit there watching my tears drip down on her face Rues cannon fires I lean forward and press my lips against her temple Slowly as if not to wake her I lay her head back on the ground and release her hand Theyll want me to clear out now So they can collect the bodies And theres nothing to stay for I roll the boy from District  onto his face and take his pack retrieve the arrow that ended his life I cut Rues pack from her back as well knowing shed want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach Weapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft Ive no use for a spear so the sooner its gone from the arena the better I cant stop looking at Rue smaller than ever a baby animal curled up in a nest of netting I cant bring myself to leave her like this Past harm but seeming utterly defenseless To hate the boy from District  who also appears so vulnerable in death seems inadequate Its the Capitol I hate for doing this to all of us Gales voice is in my head His ravings against the Capitol no longer pointless no longer to be ignored Rues death has forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty the injustice they inflict upon us But here even more strongly than at home I feel my impotenceTheres no way to take revenge on the Capitol Is there Then I remember Peetas words on the roof Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to    To show the Capital they dont own me That Im more than just a piece in their Games And for the first time I understand what he means I want to do something right here right now to shame them to make them accountable to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they cant own That Rue was more than a piece in their Games And so am I A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white I gather up an armful and come back to Rues side Slowly one stem at a time I decorate her body in the flowers Covering the ugly wound Wreathing her face Weaving her hair with bright colors Theyll have to show it Or even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment theyll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know I did it I step back and take a last look at Rue She could really be asleep in that meadow after all Bye Rue I whisper I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in herdirection Then I walk away without looking back The birds fall silent Somewhere a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft I dont know how it knows It must hearthings that humans cant I pause my eyes focused on whats ahead not whats happening behind me It doesnt take long then the general birdsong begins again and I know shes gone Another mockingjay a young one by the look of it lands on a branch before me and bursts out Rues melody My song the hovercraft were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up but it has mastered her handful of notes The ones that mean shes safe Good and safe I say as I pass under its branch We dont have to worry about her now Good and safe Ive no idea where to go The brief sense of home I had that one night with Rue has vanished My feet wander this way and that until sunset Im not afraid not even watchful Which makes me an easy target Except Id kill anyone I met on sight Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands My hatred of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors in the least Especially the Careers They at least can be made to pay for Rues death No one materializes though There arent many of us left and its a big arena Soon theyll be pulling out some other device to force us together But theres been enough gore today Perhaps well even get to sleep Im about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me A gift from a sponsor But why now Ive been in fairly good shape with supplies Maybe Haymitchs noticed my despondency and is trying to cheer me up a bit Or could it be something to help my ear I open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread Its not the fine white Capitol stuff Its made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent Sprinkled with seeds I flash back to Peetas lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center This bread came from District  I cautiously lift the still warm loaf What must it have cost the people of District  who cant even feed themselves How many wouldve had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf It had been meant for Rue surely But instead of pulling the gift when she died theyd authorized Haymitch to give it to me As a thankyou Or because like me they dont like to let debts go unpaid For whatever reason this is a first A district gift to a tribute whos not your own I lift my face and step into the last falling rays ofsunlight My thanks to the people of District Eleven I say I want them to know I know where it came from That the full value of their gift has been recognized I climb dangerously high into a tree not for safety but to get as far away from today as I can My sleeping bag is rolled neatly in Rues pack Tomorrow Ill sort through the supplies Tomorrow Ill make a new plan But tonight all I can do is strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread Its good It tastes of home Soon the seals in the sky the anthem plays in my right ear I see the boy from District  Rue Thats all for tonight Six of us left I think Only six Withthe bread still locked in my hands I fall asleep at once Sometimes when things are particularly bad my brain will give me a happy dream A visit with my father in the woods An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim Tonight it sends me Rue still decked in her flowers perched in a high sea of trees trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays I see no sign of her wounds no blood just a bright laughing girl She sings songs Ive never heard in a clear melodic voice On and on Through the night Theres a drowsy inbetween period when I can hear the last few strains of her music although shes lost in the leaves When I fully awaken Im momentarily comforted I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream but it quickly slips away leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever Heaviness infuses my whole body as if theres liquid lead in my veins Ive lost the will to do the simplest tasks to do anything but lie here staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves For several hours I remain motionless As usual its the thought of Prims anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy I give myself a series of simple commands to follow like Now you have to sit up Katniss Now you have to drink water Katniss I act on the orders with slow robotic motions Now you have to sort the packs Katniss Rues pack holds my sleeping bag her nearly empty water skin a handful of nuts and roots a bit of rabbit her extra socks and her slingshot The boy from District  has several knives two spare spearheads a flashlight a small leather pouch a firstaid kit a full bottle of water and a pack of dried fruit A pack of dried fruit Out of all he might have chosen from To me this is a sign of extreme arrogance Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp When you will kill your enemies so quickly youll be home before yourehungry I can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing Speaking of which my own supply is running low I finish off the loaf from District  and the last of the rabbit How quickly the food disappears All I have left are Rues roots and nuts the boys dried fruit and one strip of beef Now you have to hunt Katniss I tell myself I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack After I climb down the tree I conceal the boys knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them Ive lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did yesterday evening but I try and head back in the general direction of the stream I know Im on course when I come across Rues third unlit fire Shortly thereafter I discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them I return to Rues signal fire and start it up not caring about the excessive smoke Where are you Cato I think as I roast the birds and Rues roots Imwaiting right here Who knows where the Careers are now Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or  Is it possible Too scared of me They know I have the bow and arrows of course Cato saw me take them from Glimmers body but have they put two and two together yet Figured out I blew up the supplies and killed their fellow Career Possibly they think Thresh did this Wouldnt he be more likely to revenge Rues death than I would Being from the same district Not that he ever took any interest in her And what about Foxface Did she hang around to watch me blow up the supplies No When I caught her laughing in the ashes the next morning it was as if someone had given her a lovely surprise I doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire Catos sure hes as good as dead I find myself wishing I could tell Peeta about the flowers I put on Rue That I now understand what he was trying to say on the roof Perhaps if he wins the Games hell see me on victors night when they replay the highlights of the Games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform surrounded by their support crew But I told Rue Id be there For both of us And somehow that seems even more important than the vow I gave Prim I really think I stand a chance of doing it nowWinning Its not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few times although those things help Something happened when I was holding Rues hand watching the life drain out of her Now I am determined to revenge her to make her loss unforgettable and I can only do that by winning and thereby making myself unforgettable I overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot but no one does Maybe the other tributes are out there beating one another senseless Which would be fine Ever since the bloodbath Ive been featured on screens most than I care Eventually I wrap up my food and go back to the stream to replenish my water and gather some But the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me and even though its only early evening I climb a tree and settle in for the night My brain begins to replay the events from yesterday I keep seeing Rue speared my arrow piercing the boys neck I dont know why I should even care about the boy Then I realize    He was my first kill Along with other statistics they report to help people place their bets every tribute has a list of kills I guess technically Id get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District  too for dumping that nest on them But the boy from District  was the first person I knew would die because of my actionsNumerous animals have lost their lives at my hands but only one human I hear Gale saying How different can it be really Amazingly similar in the execution A bow pulled an arrow shot Entirely different in the aftermath I killed a boy whose name I dont even know Somewhere his family is weeping for him His friendscall for my blood Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back    But then I think of Rues still body and Im able to banish the boy from my mind At least for now Its been an uneventful day according to the sky No deaths I wonder how long well get until the next catastrophe drives us back together If its going to be tonight I want to get some sleep first I cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem but then I hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation For the most part the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll But occasionally there will be trumpets followed by an announcement Usually this will be a call to a feast When food is scarce the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia as an inducement to gather and fight Sometimes there is a feastand sometimes theres nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for I wouldnt go in for the food but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors Claudius Templesmiths voice booms down from overhead congratulating the six of us who remain But he is not inviting us to a feast Hes saying something very confusing Theres been a rule change in the Games A rule change That in itself is mind bending since we dont really have any rules to speak of except dont step off your circle for sixty seconds and the unspoken rule about not eating one another Under the new rule both tributes from the same district will be declared winners if they are the last two alive Claudius pauses as if he knows were not getting it and repeats the change again The news sinks in Two tributes can win this year If theyre from the same district Both can live Both of us can live Before I can stop myself I call out Peetas namePART IIITHE VICTORI clap my hands over my mouth but the sound has already escaped The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing Stupid I tell myself What a stupid thing to do I wait frozen for the woods to come alive with assailants Then I remember theres almost no one left Peeta whos been wounded is now my ally Whatever doubts Ive had about him dissipate because if either of us took the others life now wed be pariahs when we returned to District  In fact I know if I was watching Id loathe any tribute who didnt immediately ally with their district partner Besides it just makes sense to protect each other And in my case being one of the starcrossed lovers from District  its an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors The starcrossed lovers    Peeta must have been playing that angle all along Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules For two tributes to have a shot at winning our romance must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games Nothanks to me All Ive done is managed not to kill Peeta But whatever hes donein the arena he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia Fighting Cato to let me escape Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me Peeta it turns out has never been a danger to me The thought makes me smile I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it So who is there left to be afraid of Foxface The boy tribute from her district is dead Shes operating alone at night And her strategy has been to evade not attack I dont really think that even if she heard my voice shed do anything but hope someone else would kill me Then theres Thresh All right hes a distinct threat But I havent seen him not once since the Games began I think about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the site of the explosion But she didnt turn to the Woods she turned to whatever lies across from it To that area of the arena that drops off into I dont know what I feel almost certain that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain Hed never have heard me from there and even if he did Im up too high for someone his size to reach So that leaves Cato and the girl from District  who are now surely celebrating the new rule Theyre the onlyones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself Do I run from them now on the chance they heard me call Peetas name No I think Let them come Let them come with their nightvision glasses and their heavy branchbreaking bodies Right into the range of my arrows But I know they wont If they didnt come in daylight to my fire they wont risk what could be another trap at night When they come it will be on their own terms not because Ive let them know my whereabouts Stay put and get some sleep Katniss I instruct myself although I wish I could start tracking Peeta now Tomorrow youll find him I do sleep but in the morning Im extracautious thinking that while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree theyre completely capable of setting an ambush for me I make sure to fully prepare myself for the day eating a big breakfast securing my pack readying my weapons before I descend But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground Today Ill have to be scrupulously careful The Careers will know Im trying to locate Peeta They may well want to wait until I do before they move in If hes as badly wounded as Cato thinks Id be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance But if hes that incapacitated how has he managed to stay alive And how on earth will I find him Itry to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me an indication as to where hes hiding out but nothing rings a bell So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the sunlight yelling at me to run Then Cato appeared hissword drawn And after I was gone he wounded Peeta But how did Peeta get away Maybe hed held out better against the tracker jacker poison than Cato Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape But hed been stung too So how far could he have gotten stabbed and filled with venom And how has he stayed alive all these days since If the wound and the stingers havent killed him surely thirst would have taken him by now And thats when I get my first clue to his whereabouts He couldnt have survived without water I know that from my first few days here He must be hidden somewhere near a source Theres the lake but I find that an unlikely option since its so close to the Careers base camp A few springfed pools But youd really be a sitting duck at one of those And the stream The one that leads from the camp Rue and I made all the way down near the lake and beyond If he stuck to the stream he could change his location and always be near water He could walk in thecurrent and erase any tracks He might even be able to get a fish or two Well its a place to start anyway To confuse my enemies minds I start a fire with plenty of green wood Even if they think its a ruse I hope theyll decide Im hidden somewhere near it While in reality Ill be tracking Peeta The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual The waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream Im tempted to call out Peetas name as I go but decide against it I will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me But hell know Ill be looking right He wont have so low of an opinion of me as to think Id ignore the new rule and keep to myself Would he Hes very hard to predict which might be interesting under different circumstances but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle It doesnt take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to go the Careers camp Theres been no sign of Peeta but this doesnt surprise me Ive been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident If he were nearby surely Id have had some suspicion of it The stream begins to curve to the left into a part of the woods thats new to me Muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in size until Ibegin to feel somewhat trapped It would be no small matter to escape the stream now Fighting off Cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky terrain In fact Ive just about decided Im on the wrong track entirely that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source when I see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder Its long dried now but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties tried to wipe it away Hugging the rocks I move slowly in the direction of the blood searching for him I find a few more bloodstains onewith a few threads of fabric glued to it but no sign of life I break down and say his name in a hushed voice Peeta Peeta Then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones so I stop I give up and climb back down to the stream thinking He must have moved on Somewhere farther down My foot has just broken the surface of the water when I hear a voice You here to finish me off sweetheart I whip around Its come from the left so I cant pick it up very well And the voice was hoarse and weak Still it must have been Peeta Who else in the arena would call mesweetheart My eyes peruse the bank but theres nothing Just mud the plants the base of the rocks Peeta I whisper Where are you Theres no answer Could I just have imagined it No Im certain it was real and very close at hand too Peeta I creep along the bank Well dont step on me I jump back His voice was right under my feet Still theres nothing Then his eyes open unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs Its the final word in camouflage Forget chucking weights around Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree Or a boulder Or a muddy bank full of weeds Close your eyes again I order He does and his mouth too and completely disappears Most of what I judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible I kneel beside him I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off Peeta smiles Yes frosting The final defense of the dying Youre not going to die I tell him firmly Says who His voice is so ragged Says me Were on the same team now you know I tell him His eyes open So I heard Nice of you to find whats left of me I pull out my water bottle and give him a drink Did Cato cut you I ask Left legUp high he answers Lets get you in the stream wash you off so I can see what kind of wounds youve got I say Lean down a minute first he says Need to tell you something I lean over and put my good ear to his lips which tickle as he whispers Remember were madly in love so its all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it I jerk my head back but end up laughing Thanks Ill keep it in mind At least hes still able to joke around But when I start to help him to the stream all the levity disappears Its only two feet away how hard can it be Very hard when I realize hes unable to move an inch on his own Hes so weak that the best he can do is not to resist I try to drag him but despite the fact that I know hes doing all he can to keep quiet sharp cries of pain escape him The mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him and I finally have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their clutches Hes still two feet from the water lying there teeth gritted tears cutting trails in the dirt on his face Look Peeta Imgoing to roll you into the stream Its very shallow here okay I say Excellent he says I crouch down beside him No matter what happens I tell myself dont stopuntil hes in the water On three I say One two three I can only manage one full roll before I have to stop because of the horrible sound hes making Now hes on the edge of the stream Maybe this is better anyway Okay change of plans Im not going to put you all the way in I tell him Besides if I get him in who knows if Id ever be able to get him out No more rolling he asks Thats all done Lets get you cleaned up Keep an eye on the woods for me okay I say Its hard to know where to start He so caked with mud and matted leaves I cant even see his clothes If hes wearing clothes The thought makes me hesitate a moment but then I plunge in Naked bodies are no big deal in the arena right Ive got two water bottles and Rues water skin I prop them against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while I pour the third over Peetas body It takes a while but I finally get rid of enough mud to find his clothes I gently unzip his jacket unbutton his shirt and ease them off him His undershirt is so plastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with my knife and drench him again to work it loose Hes badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker jacker stings if you count the one under his ear But I feel a bit better This much I can fix I decide to take care of his upper body first to alleviatesome pain before I tackle whatever damage Cato did to his leg Since treating his wounds seems pointless when hes lying in whats become a mud puddle I manage to prop him up against a boulder He sits there uncomplaining while I wash away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin His flesh is very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and stocky I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker lumps which causes him to wince but the minute I apply the leaves he sighs in relief While he dries in the sun I wash his filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders Then I apply the burn cream to his chest This is when I notice how hot his skin is becoming The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that hes burning with fever I dig through the firstaid kit I got from the boy from District  and find pills that reduce your temperature My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail Swallow these I tell him and he obediently takes the medicine You must be hungry Not really Its funny I havent been hungry for days says Peeta In fact when I offer him groosling he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away Thats when I know how sick he is Peeta we need to get some food in you I insist Itll just come right back up he says The best Ican do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple Thanks Im much better really Can I sleep nowKatniss he asks Soon I promise I need to look at your leg first Trying to be as gentle as I can I remove his boots his socks and then very slowly inch his pants off of him I can see the tear Catos sword made in the fabric over his thigh but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath The deep inflamed gash oozing both blood and pus The swelling of the leg And worst of all the smell of festering flesh I want to run away Disappear into the woods like I did that day they brought the burn victim to our house Go and hunt while my mother and Prim attend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage to face But theres no one here but me I try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases Pretty awful huh says Peeta Hes watching me closely Soso I shrug like its no big deal You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines I refrain from saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever shes treating anything worse than a cold Come to think of it I dont even much like to be around coughingFirst thing is to clean it well Ive left on Peetas undershorts because theyre not in bad shape and I dont want to pull them over the swollen thigh and all right maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable Thats another thing about my mother and Prim Nakedness has no effect on them gives them no cause for embarrassment Ironically at this point in the Games my little sister would be of far more use to Peeta than I am I scoot my square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of him With each bottle I pour over him the worse the wound looks The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well just one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat quickly But the gash on his leg    What on earth can I do for that Why dont we give it some air and then    I trail off And then youll patch it up says Peeta He looks almost sorry for me as if he knows how lost I am Thats right I say In the meantime you eat these I put a few dried pear halves in his hand and go back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes When theyre flattened out and drying I examine the contents of the firstaid kit Its pretty basic stuff Bandages fever pills medicine to calm stomachs Nothing of the caliber Ill need to treat Peeta Were going to have to experiment some I admit I know the tracker jacker leavesdraw out infection so I start with those Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewedup green stuff into the wound pus begins running down the side of his leg I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a reappearance Katniss Peeta says I meet his eyes knowing my face must be some shade of green He mouths the words How about that kiss I burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting I cant stand it Something wrong he asks a little tooinnocently I    Im no good at this Im not my mother Ive no idea what Im doing and I hate pus I say Euh I allow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second Euuuh How do you hunt he asks Trust me Killing things is much easier than this I say Although for all I know I am killing you Can you speed it up a little he asks No Shut up and eat your pears I say After three applications and what seems like a bucket of pus the wound does look better Now that the swelling has gone down I can see how deep Catos sword cut Right down to the bone What next Dr Everdeen he asks Maybe Ill put some of the burnointment on it I think it helps with infection anyway And wrap it up I say I do and the whole thing seems a lot more manageable covered in clean white cotton Although against the sterile bandage the hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion I pull out Rues backpack Here cover yourself with this and Ill wash your shorts Oh I dont care if you see me says Peeta Youre just like the rest of my family I say I care all right I turn my back and look at the stream until the undershorts splash into the current He must be feeling a bit better if he can throw You know youre kind of squeamish for such a lethal person says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between two rocks I wish Id let you give Haymitch a shower after all I wrinkle my nose at the memory Whats he sent you so far Not a thing says Peeta Then theres a pause as it hits him Why did you get something Burn medicine I say almost sheepishly Oh and some bread I always knew you were his favorite says Peeta Please he cant stand being in the same room with me I say Because youre just alike mutters Peeta I ignore it though because this really isnt the time for me to be insulting Haymitch which is my first impulse I let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out but by late afternoon I dont dare wait any longer I gently shake hisshoulder Peeta weve got to go now Go He seems confused Go where Away from here Downstream maybe Somewhere we can hide you until youre stronger I say I help him dress leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the water and pull him upright His face drains of color the moment he puts weight on his leg Come on You can do this But he cant Not for long anyway We make it about fifty yards downstream with him propped up by my shoulder and I can tell hes going to black out I sit him on the bank push his head between his knees and pat his back awkwardly as I survey the area Of course Id love to get him up in a tree but thats not going to happen It could be worse though Some of the rocks form small cavelike structures I set my sights on one about twenty yards above the stream When Peetas able to stand I halfguide halfcarry him up to the cave Really Id like to look around for a better place but this one will have to do because myally is shot Paper white panting and even though its only just cooling off hes shivering I cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles unroll my sleeping bag and tuck him into it I get a couple of pills and some water into himwhen hes not noticing but he refuses to eat even the fruit Then he just lies there his eyes trained on my face as I build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the mouth of the cave The result is unsatisfactory An animal might not question it but a human would see hands had manufactured it quickly enough I tear it down in frustration Katniss he says I go over to him and brush the hair back from his eyes Thanks for finding me You would have found me if you could I say His foreheads burning up Like the medicines having no effect at all Suddenly out of nowhere Im scared hes going to die Yes Look if I dont make it back he begins Dont talk like that I didnt drain all that pus for nothing I say I know But just in case I dont he tries to continue No Peeta I dont even want to discuss it I say placing my fingers on his lips to quiet him But I he insists Impulsively I lean forward and kiss him stopping his words This is probably overdue anyway since hes right we are supposed to be madly in love Its the first time Ive ever kissed a boy which should make some sort of impression I guess but all I can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever I break away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up around him Youre not going to die I forbid it All right All right he whispers I step out in the coolevening air just as the parachute floats down from the sky My fingers quickly undo the tie hoping for some real medicine to treat Peetas leg Instead I find a pot of hot broth Haymitch couldnt be sending me a clearer message One kiss equals one pot of broth I can almost hear his snarl Youre supposed to be in love sweetheart The boys dying Give me something I can work with And hes right If I want to keep Peeta alive Ive got to give the audience something more to care about Starcrossed lovers desperate to get home together Two hearts beating as one Romance Never having been in love this is going to be a real trick I think of my parents The way my father never failed to bring her gifts from the woods The way my mothers face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door The way she almost stopped living when he died Peeta I say trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father Hes dozed off again but I kiss him awake which seems to startle him Then he smiles as if hed be happy to lie there gazing at me forever Hes great at this stuff I hold up the pot Peeta look what Haymitch has sent youGetting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing begging threatening and yes kissing but finally sip by sip he empties the pot I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs wolfing down a supper ofgroosling and roots while I watch the daily report in the sky No new casualties Still Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting day Hopefully the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night I automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before I realize thats over At least for a while I cant very well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground I left the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the stream untouched how could I conceal it and were a scant fifty yards downstream I put on my glasses place my weapons in readiness and settle down to keep watch The temperature drops rapidly and soon Im chilled to the bone Eventually I give in and slide into the sleeping bag with Peeta Its toasty warm and I snuggle down gratefully until I realize its more than warm its overly hot because the bag is reflecting back his fever I check his forehead and find it burning and dry I dont know what to do Leave him in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks thefever Take him out and hope the night air cools him off I end up just dampening a strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead It seems weak but Im afraid to do anything too drastic I spend the night halfsitting halflying next to Peeta refreshing the bandage and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him Ive made myself far more vulnerable than when I was alone Tethered to the ground on guard with a very sick person to take care of But I knew he was injured And still I came after him Im just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one When the sky turns rosy I notice the sheen of sweat on Peetas lip and discover the fever has broken Hes not back to normal but its come down a few degrees Last night when I was gathering vines I came upon a bush of Rues berries I strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water Peetas struggling to get up when I reach the cave I woke up and you were gone he says I was worried about you I have to laugh as I ease him back down You were worried about me Have you taken a look at yourself lately I thought Cato and Clove might have found you They like to hunt at night he says still serious Clove Which one is that I ask The girl from District Two Shes still alive right hesays Yes theres just them and us and Thresh and Foxface I say Thats what I nicknamed the girl from Five How do you feel Better than yesterday This is an enormous improvement over the mud he says Clean clothes and medicine and a sleeping bag    And you Oh right the whole romance thing I reach out to touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips I remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and I wonder where Peeta picked it up Surely not from his father and the witch No more kisses for you until youve eaten I say We get him propped up against the wall and he obediently swallows the spoonfuls of theberry mush I feed him He refuses the groosling again though You didnt sleep Peeta says Im all right I say But the truth is Im exhausted Sleep now Ill keep watch Ill wake you if anything happens he says I hesitate Katniss you cant stay up forever Hes got a point there Ill have to sleep eventually And probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side All right I say But just for a few hours Then you wake me Its too warm for the sleeping bag now I smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down one hand on my loaded bow incase I have to shoot at a moments notice Peeta sits beside me leaning against the wall his bad leg stretched out before him his eyes trained on the world outside Go to sleep he says softly His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far this gesture seems natural and comforting I dont want him to stop and he doesnt Hes still stroking my hair when I fall asleep Too long I sleep too long I know from the moment I open my eyes that were into the afternoon Peetas right beside me his position unchanged I sit up feeling somehow defensive but better rested than Ive been in days Peeta you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours I say For what Nothings going on here he says Besides I like watching you sleep You dont scowl Improves your looks a lot This of course brings on a scowl that makes him grin Thats when I notice how dry his lips are I test his cheek Hot as a coal stove He claims hes been drinking but the containers still feel full to me I give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one then a second quart of water Then I tend to his minor wounds the burns the stings which are showing improvement I steel myself and unwrap the leg My heart drops into my stomach Its worse much worse Theres nomore pus in evidence but the swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed Then I see the red streaks starting to crawl up his leg Blood poisoning Unchecked it will kill him for sure My chewedup leaves and ointment wont make a dent in it Well need strong antiinfection drugs from the Capitol I cant imagine the cost of such potent medicine If Haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor would he have enough I doubt it Gifts go up in price the longer the Games continue What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve And the kind of medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning Well theres more swelling but the pus is gone I say in an unsteady voice I know what blood poisoning is Katniss says Peeta Even if my mother isnt a healer Youre just going to have to outlast the others Peeta Theyll cure it back at the Capitol when we win I say Yes thats a good plan he says But I feel this is mostly for my benefit You have to eat Keep your strength up Im going to make yousoup I say Dont light a fire he says Its not worth it Well see I say As I take the pot down to the stream Im struck by how brutally hot it is I swear theGamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime and sending it plummeting at night The heat of the sunbaked stones by the stream gives me an idea though Maybe I wont need to light a fire I settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream and the cave After purifying half a pot of water I place it in direct sunlight and add several eggsize hot stones to the water Im the first to admit Im not much of a cook But since soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting its one of my better dishes I mince groosling until its practically mush and mash some of Rues roots Fortunately theyve both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated up Already between the sunlight and the rocks the waters warm I put in the meat and roots swap in fresh rocks and go find something green to spice it up a little Before long I discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks Perfect I chop them very fine and add them to the pot switch out the rocks again put on the lid and let the whole thing stew Ive seen very few signs of game around but I dont feel comfortable leaving Peeta alone while I hunt so I rig half a dozen snares and hope I get lucky I wonder about the other tributes how theyre managing now that their main source of food has been blown upAt least three of them Cato Clove and Foxface had been relying on it Probably not Thresh though Ive got a feeling he must share some of Rues knowledge on how to feed yourself from the earth Are they fighting each other Looking for us Maybe one of them has located us and is just waiting for the right moment to attack The idea sends me back to the cave Peetas stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the shade of the rocks Although he brightens a bit when I come in its clear he feels miserable I put cool cloths on his head but they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin Do you want anything I ask No he says Thank you Wait yes Tell me a story A story What about I say Im not much for storytelling Its kind of like singing But once in a while Prim wheedles one out of me Something happy Tell me about the happiest day you can remember says Peeta Something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves my mouth A happy story This will require a lot more effort than the soup I rack my brains for good memories Most of them involve Gale and me out hunting and somehow I dont think these will play well with either Peeta or the audience That leaves Prim Did I ever tell you about how I got Prims goat I ask Peeta shakes his head and looks at me expectantly So I begin But carefullyBecause my words are going out all over Panem And while people have no doubt put two and two together that I hunt illegally I dont want to hurt Galeor Greasy Sae or the butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who are my customers by publicly announcing theyd breaking the law too Heres the real story of how I got the money for Prims goat Lady It was a Friday evening the day before Prims tenth birthday in late May As soon as school ended Gale and I hit the woods because I wanted to get enough to trade for a present for Prim Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush Our snares had done well enough and the woods were flush with greens but this was really no more than our average Fridaynight haul I was disappointed as we headed back even though Gale said wed be sure to do better tomorrow We were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him A young buck probably a yearling by his size His antlers were just growing in still small and coated in velvet Poised to run but unsure of us unfamiliar with humans Beautiful Less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him one in the neck the other in the chest Gale and I had shot at the same time The buck tried to run but stumbled andGales knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened Momentarily Id felt a pang at killing something so fresh and innocent And then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that fresh and innocent meat A deer Gale and I have only brought down three in all The first one a doe that had injured her leg somehow almost didnt count But we knew from that experience not to go dragging the carcass into the Hob It had caused chaos with people bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces themselves Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us with our deer to the butcher but not before itd been badly damaged hunks of meat taken the hide riddled with holes Although everybody paid up fairly it had lowered the value of the kill This time we waited until dark fell and slipped under a hole in the fence close to the butcher Even though we were known hunters it wouldnt have been good to go carrying a pound deer through the streets of District  in daylight like we were rubbing it in the officials faces The butcher a short chunky woman named Rooba came to the back door when we knocked You dont haggle with Rooba She gives you one price which you can take or leave but its a fair price We took her offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison steaks we could pick up after thebutchering Even with the money divided in two neither Gale nor I had held so much at one time in our lives We decided to keep it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money at the end of the next day This is where I really got the money for the goat but I tell Peeta I sold an old silver locket of my mothers That cant hurt anyone Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prims birthday Gale and I went to the market on the square so that I could buy dress materials As I was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth something caught myeye Theres an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the Seam I dont know his real name everyone just calls him the Goat Man His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles and hes got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines But hes lucky Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death Hes filthy and impatient but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it One of the goats a white one with black patches was lying down in a cart It was easy to see why Something probably a dog had mauled hershoulder and infection had set in It was bad the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her But I thought I knew someone who could fix it Gale I whispered I want that goat for Prim Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District  The animals can live off almost anything the Meadows a perfect feeding place and they can give four quarts of milk a day To drink to make into cheese to sell Its not even against the law Shes hurt pretty bad said Gale We better take a closer look We went over and bought a cup of milk to share then stood over the goat as if idly curious Let her be said the man Just looking said Gale Well look fast She goes to the butcher soon Hardly anyone will buy her milk and then they only pay half price said the man Whats the butcher giving for her I asked The man shrugged Hang around and see I turned and saw Rooba coming across the square toward us Lucky thing you showed up said the Goat Man when she arrived Girls got her eye on your goat Not if shes spoken for I said carelessly Rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat Shes not Look at that shoulder Bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage What said the Goat Man We had a deal We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks Not that thing Sell her to the girl if shes stupid enough to takeher said Rooba As she marched off I caught her wink The Goat Man was mad but he still wanted that goal off his hands It took us half an hour to agree on the price Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions It was an excellent deal if the goat lived Id been robbed if she died People took sides in the argument but I took the goat Gale offered to carry her I think he wanted to see the look on Prims face as much as I did In a moment of complete giddiness I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck Then we hurried back to my house You should have seen Prims reaction when we walked in with that goat Remember this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat Buttercup She was so excited she started crying and laughing all at once My mother was less sure seeing the injury but the pair of them went to work on it grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animals throat They sound like you says Peeta I had almost forgotten hewas there Oh no Peeta They work magic That thing couldnt have died if it tried I say But then I bite my tongue realizing what that must sound like to Peeta who is dying in my incompetent hands Dont worry Im not trying he jokes Finishthe story Well thats it Only I remember that night Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire And just before they drifted off the goat licked her cheek like it was giving her a good night kiss or something I say It was already mad about her Was it still wearing the pink ribbon he asks I think so I say Why Im just trying to get a picture he says thoughtfully I can see why that day made you happy Well I knew that goat would be a little gold mine  say Yes of course I was referring to that not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping says Peeta drily The goat has paid for itself Several times over I say in a superior tone Well it wouldnt dare do anything else after you saved its life says Peeta I intend to do the same thing Really What did you cost me again I ask A lot of trouble Dont worry Youll get it all back he says Youre not making sense I say I test his forehead The levers going nowhere but up Youre a little cooler though The sound of the trumpets startles me Im on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash not wanting to miss a syllable Its my new best friend Claudius Templesmith and as I expected hes inviting us to a feast Well were not that hungry and I actually wave his offer away in indifference when he says Nowhold on Some of you may already be declining my invitation But this is no ordinary feast Each of you needs something desperately I do need something desperately Something to heal Peetas leg Each of you will find that something in a backpack marked with your district number at the Cornucopia at dawn Think hard about refusing to show up For some of you this will be your last chance says Claudius Theres nothing else just his words hanging in the air I jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind No he says Youre not risking your life for me Who said I was I say So youre not going he asks Of course Im not going Give me some credit Do you think Im running straight into some freeforall against Cato and Clove and Thresh Dont be stupid I say helping him back to bed Ill let them fight it out well see whos in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there Youre such a bad liar Katniss I dont know how youve survived this long He begins to mimic me I knew that goat would be a little gold mine Youre a little cooler though Of course Im not going He shakes his head Never gamble at cards Youll lose your last coin he says Anger flushes my face All right I am going and you cant stop me I can follow you At least partway I may not make it to the Cornucopia but if Im yelling yourname I bet someone can find me And thenIll be dead for sure he says You wont get a hundred yards from here on that leg I say Then Ill drag myself says Peeta You go and Im going too Hes just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to do it Come howling after me in the woods Even if a tribute doesnt find him something else might He cant defend himself Id probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go myself And who knows what the exertion will do to him What am I supposed to do Sit here and watch you die I say He must know thats not an option That the audience would hate me And frankly I would hate myself too if I didnt even try I wont die I promise If you promise not to go he says Were at something of a stalemate I know I cant argue him out of this one so I dont try I pretend reluctantly to go along Then you have to do what I say Drink your water wake me when I tell you and eat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it is I snap at him Agreed Is it ready he asks Wait here I say The airs gone cold even though the suns still up Im right about the Gamemakers messing with the temperature I wonder if the thingsomeone needs desperately is a good blanket The soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot And actually doesnt taste too bad Peeta eats without complaint even scraping out the pot to show his enthusiasm He rambles on about how delicious it is which should be encouraging if you dont know what fever does to people Hes like listening to Haymitch before the alcohol has soaked him into incoherence I give him another dose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely As I go down to the stream to wash up all I can think is that hes going to die if I dont get to that feast Ill keep him going for a day or two and then the infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs and hell be gone And Ill be here all alone Again Waiting for the others Im so lost in thought that I almost miss the parachute even though it floats right by me Then I spring after it yanking it from the water tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial Haymitch has done it Hes gotten the medicine I dont know how persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels and I can save Peeta Its such a tiny vial though It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta A ripple of doubt runs through me I uncork the vial and take a deep sniff My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent Just to be sure I place a drop on the tip of mytongue Theres no question its sleep syrup Its a common medicine in District  Cheap as medicine goes but very addictive Almost everyones had a dose at one time or another We have some in a bottle at home My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night It only takes a little A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full day but what good is that Imso furious Im about to throw Haymitchs last offering into the stream when it hits me A full day Thats more than I need I mash up a handful of berries so the taste wont be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure Then I head back up to the cave Ive brought you a treat I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation He swallows then frowns slightly Theyre very sweet Yes theyre sugar berries My mother makes jam from them Havent you ever had them before I say poking the next spoonful in his mouth No he says almost puzzled But they taste familiar Sugar berries Well you cant get them in the market much they only grow wild I say Another mouthfulgoes down Just one more to go Theyre sweet as syrup he says taking the last spoonful Syrup His eyes widen as he realizes the truth I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard forcing him to swallow instead of spit He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up but its too late hes already losing consciousness Even as he fades away I can see in his eyes what Ive done is unforgivable I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction A stray berry stains his chin and I wipe it away Who cant lie Peeta I say even though he cant hear me It doesnt matter The rest of Panem canIn the remaining hours before nightfall I gather rocks and do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave Its a slow and arduous process but after a lot of sweating and shifting things around Im pretty pleased with my work The cave now appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks like so many in the vicinity I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening but its undetectable from the out sideThats good because Ill need to share that sleeping bag again tonight Also if I dont make it back from the feast Peeta will be hidden but not entirely imprisoned Although I doubt he can hang on much longer without medicine If I die at the feast District  isnt likely to have a victor I make a meal out of the smaller bonier fish that inhabit the stream down here fill every water container and purify it and clean my weapons Ive nine arrows left in all I debate leaving the knife with Peeta so hell have some protection while Im gone but theres really no point He was right about camouflage being his final defense But I still might have use for the knife Who knows what Ill encounter Here are some things Im fairly certain of That at least Cato Clove and Thresh will be on hand when the feast starts Im not sure about Foxface since direct confrontation isnt her style or her forte Shes even smaller than I am and unarmed unless shes picked up some weapons recently Shell probably be hanging somewhere nearby seeing what she can scavenge But the other three    Im going to have my hands full My ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset but I know Ill have to goright into the thick of things to get that backpack the one with the number  on it that Claudius Templesmith mentioned I watch the sky hoping for one less opponent at dawn but nobody appears tonight Tomorrow there will be faces up there Feasts always result in fatalities I crawl into the cave secure my glasses and curl up next to Peeta Luckily I had that good long sleep today I have to stay awake I dont really think anyone will attack our cave tonight but I cant risk missing the dawn So cold so bitterly cold tonight As if the Gamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air across the arena which may be exactly what theyve done I lay next to Peeta in the bag trying to absorb every bit of his fever heat Its strange to be so physically close to someone whos so distant Peeta might as well be back in the Capitol or in District  or on the moon right now hed be no harder to reach Ive never felt lonelier since the Games began Just accept it will be a bad night I tell myself I try not to but I cant help thinking of my mother and Prim wondering if theyll sleep a wink tonight At this late stage in the Games with an important event like the feast school will probably be canceled My family can either watch on that staticfilled old clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the square towatch on the big clear screens Theyll have privacy at home but support in the square People will give them a kind word a bit of food if they can spare it I wonder if the baker has sought them out especially now that Peeta and I are a team and made good on his promise to keep my sisters belly full Spirits must be running high in District  We so rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the Games Surely people are excited about Peeta and me especially now that were together If I close my eyes I can imagine their shouts at the screens urging us on I see their faces Greasy Sac and Madge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for us And Gale I know him He wont be shouting and cheering But hell be watching every moment every twist and turn and willing me to come home I wonder if hes hoping that Peeta makes it as well Gales not my boyfriend but would he be if I opened that door He talked about us running away together Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district Or something more I wonder what he makes of all this kissing Through a crack in the rocks I watch the moon cross the sky At what I judge to be about three hours before dawn I begin final preparations Im careful to leave Peeta with water and the medical kit right beside him Nothingelse will be of much use if I dont return and even these would only prolong his life a short time After some debate I strip him of his jacket and zip it on over my own He doesnt need it Not now in the sleeping bag with his fever and during the day if Im not there to remove it hell be roasting init My hands are already stiff from cold so I take Rues spare pair of socks cut holes for my fingers and thumbs and pull them on It helps anyway I fill her small pack with some food a water bottle and bandages tuck the knife in my belt get my bow and arrows Im about to leave when I remember the importance of sustaining the starcrossed lover routine and I lean over and give Peeta a long lingering kiss I imagine the teary sighs emanating from the Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own Then I squeeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night My breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air Its as cold as a November night at home One where Ive slipped into the woods lantern in hand to join Gale at some prearranged place where well sit bundled together sipping herb tea from metal flasks wrapped in quilting hoping game will pass our way as the morning comes on OhGale I think If only you had my back now    I move as fast as I dare The glasses are quite remarkable but I still sorely miss having the use of my left ear I dont know what the explosion did but it damaged something deep and irreparable Never mind If I get home Ill be so stinking rich Ill be able to pay someone to do my hearing The woods always look different at night Even with the glasses everything has an unfamiliar slant to it As if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their places I dont try anything tricky like taking a new route I make my way back up the stream and follow the same path back to Rues hiding place near the lake Along the way I see no sign of another tribute not a puff of breath not a quiver of a branch Either Im the first to arrive or the others positioned themselves last night Theres still more than an hour maybe two when I wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to flow I chew a few mint leaves my stomach isnt up for much more Thank goodness I have Peetas jacket as well as my own If not Id be forced to move around to stay warm The sky turns a misty morning gray and still theres no sign of the other tributes Its not surprising really Everyone has distinguished themselves either bystrength or deadliness or cunning Do they suppose I wonder that I have Peeta with me I doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded All the better if they think hes covering me when I go in for the backpack But where is it The arena has lightened enough for me to remove my glasses I can hear the morning birds singing Isnt it time For a second Im panicked that Im at the wrong location But no Im certain I remember Claudius Templesmith specifying the Cornucopia And there it is And here I am So wheres my feast Just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold Cornucopia theres a disturbance on the plain The ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a snowy whitecloth rises into the arena On the table sit four backpacks two large black ones with the numbers  and  a mediumsize green one with the number  and a tiny orange one really I could carry it around my wrist that must be marked with a  The table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out of the Cornucopia snags the green backpack and speeds off Foxface Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and risky idea The rest of us are still poised around the plain sizing up thesituation and shes got hers Shes got us trapped too because no one wants to chase her down not while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table Foxface must have purposefully left the other packs alone knowing that to steal one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer That should have been my strategy By the lime Ive worked through the emotions of surprise admiration anger jealousy and frustration Im watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range Huh Im always dreading the others but maybe Foxface is the real opponent here Shes cost me time too because by now its clear that I must get to the table next Anyone who beats me to it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone Without hesitation I sprint for the table I can sense the emergence of danger before I see it Fortunately the first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so I can hear it and Im able to deflect it with my bow I turn drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow straight at Cloves heart She turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit but the point punctures her upper left arm Unfortunately she throws with her right but its enough to slow her down a few moments having to pull the arrow from her arm take in the severity of the wound I keep moving positioningthe next arrow automatically as only someone who has hunted for years can do Im at the table now my fingers closing over the tiny orange backpack My hand slips between the straps and I yank it up on my arm its really too small to fit on any other part of my anatomy and Im turning to fire again when the second knife catches me in the forehead It slices above my right eyebrow opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face blinding my eye filling my mouth with the sharp metallic taste of my own blood I stagger backward but still manage to send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assailant I know as it leaves my hands it will miss And then Clove slams into me knocking me flat on my back pinning my shoulders to the ground with her knees This is it I think and hope for Prims sake it will be fast But Clove means to savor the moment Even feels she has time No doubt Cato is somewhere nearby guarding her waiting for Thresh and possibly Peeta Wheres your boyfriend District Twelve Still hanging on she asks Well as long as were talking Im alive Hes out there now Hunting Cato I snarl at her Then I scream atthe top of my lungs Peeta Clove jams her fist into my windpipe veryeffectively cutting off my voice But her heads whipping from side to side and I know for a moment shes at least considering Im telling the truth Since no Peeta appears to save me she turns back to me Liar she says with a grin Hes nearly dead Cato knows where he cut him Youve probably got him strapped up in some tree while you try to keep his heart going Whats in the pretty little backpack That medicine for Lover Boy Too bad hell never get it Clove opens her jacket Its lined with an impressive array of knives She carefully selects an almost daintylooking number with a cruel curved blade I promised Cato if he let me have you Id give the audience a good show Im struggling now in an effort to unseat her but its no use Shes too heavy and her lock on me too tight Forget it District Twelve Were going to kill you Just like we did your pathetic little ally    What was her name The one who hopped around in the trees Rue Well first Rue then you and then I think well just let nature take care of Lover Boy How does that sound Clove asks Now where to start She carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with her jacket sleeve For a moment she surveys my face tilting it from side to side as if its a block of wood and shes deciding exactly what pattern to carve on it I attempt to bite her hand but shegrabs the hair on the top of my head forcing me back to the ground I think    She almost purrs I think well start with your mouth I clamp my teeth together as she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade I wont close my eyes The comment about Rue has filled me with fury enough fury I think to die with some dignity As my last act of defiance I will stare her down as long as I can see which will probably not be an extended period of time but I will stare her down I will not cry out I will die in my own small way undefeated Yes I dont think youll have much use for your lips anymore Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss she asks I work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face She flushes with rage All right then Lets get started I brace myself for the agony thats sure to follow But as I feel the tip open the first cut at my lip some great form yanks Clove from my body and then shes screaming Im too stunned at first too unable to process what has happened Has Peeta somehow come to my rescue Have the Gamemakers sent in some wild animal to add to the fun Has a hovercraft inexplicably plucked her into the air But when I push myself up on my numb arms I see its none of the above Clove is dangling a foot off the ground imprisoned in Threshs arms I let out a gaspseeing him like that towering over me holding Clove like a rag doll I remember him as big but he seems more massive more powerful than I even recall If anything he seems to have gained weight in the arena He flipsClove around and flings her onto the ground When he shouts I jump never having heard him speak above a mutter Whatd you do to that little girl You kill her Clove is scrambling backward on all fours like a frantic insect too shocked to even call for Cato No No it wasnt me You said her name I heard you You kill her Another thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features You cut her up like you were going to cut up this girl here No No I Clove sees the stone about the size of a small loaf of bread in Threshs hand and loses it Cato she screeches Cato Clove I hear Catos answer but hes too far away I can tell that much to do her any good What was he doing Trying to get Foxface or Peeta Or had he been lying in wait for Thresh and just badly misjudged his location Thresh brings the rock down hard against Cloves temple Its not bleeding but I can see the dent in her skull and I know that shes a goner Theres still life in her now though in the rapid rise and fall of herchest the low moan escaping her lips When Thresh whirls around on me the rock raised I know its no good to run And my bow is empty the last loaded arrow having gone in Cloves direction Im trapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes Whatd she mean About Rue being your ally I I we teamed up Blew up the supplies I tried to save her I did But he got there first District One I say Maybe if he knows I helped Rue he wont choose some slow sadistic end for me And you killed him he demands Yes I killed him And buried her in flowers I say And I sang her to sleep Tears spring in my eyes The tension the fight goes out of me at the memory And Im overwhelmed by Rue and the pain in my head and my fear of Thresh and the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away To sleep Thresh says gruffly To death I sang until she died I say Your district   They sent me bread My hand reaches up but not for an arrow that I know Ill never reach Just to wipe my nose Do it fast okay Thresh Conflicting emotions cross Threshs face He lowers the rock and points at me almost accusingly Just this one time I let you go For the little girl You and me were even then No more owed You understand I nod because I do understand About owing About hating it I understand that if Threshwins hell have to go back and face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank me and he is breaking the rules to thank me too And I understand that for the moment Thresh is not going to smash in my skull Clove Catos voice is much nearer now I can tell by the pain in it that he sees her on the ground You better run now Fire Girl says Thresh I dont need to be told twice I flip over and my feet dip into the hardpacked earth as I run away from Thresh and Clove and the sound of Catos voice Only when I reach the woods do I turn back for an instant Thresh and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge of the plain into thearea Ive never seen Cato kneels beside Clove spear in hand begging her to stay with him In a moment he will realize its futile she cant be saved I crash into the trees repeatedly swiping away the blood thats pouring into my eye fleeing like the wild wounded creature I am After a few minutes I hear the cannon and I know that Clove has died that Cato will be on one of our trails Either Threshs or mine Im seized with terror weak from my head wound shaking I load an arrow but Cato can throw that spear almost as far as I can shoot Only one thing calms me down Threshhas Catos backpack containing the thing he needs desperately If I had to bet Cato headed out after Thresh not me Still I dont slow down when I reach the water I plunge right in boots still on and flounder downstream I pull off Rues socks that Ive been using for gloves and press them into my forehead trying to staunch the flow of blood but theyre soaked in minutes Somehow I make it back to the cave I squeeze through the rocks In the dappled light I pull the little orange backpack from my arm cut open the clasp and dump the contents on the ground One slim box containing one hypodermic needle Without hesitating I jam the needle into Peetas arm and slowly press down on the plunger My hands go to my head and then drop to my lap slick with blood The last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful greenandsilver moth landing on the curve of my wristThe sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me toward consciousness I fight to return to sleep though wrapped in a warm cocoon ofblankets safe at home Im vaguely aware that my head aches Possibly I have the flu and this is why Im allowed to stay in bed even though I can tell Ive been asleep a long time My mothers hand strokes my cheek and I dont push it away as I would in wakefulness never wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch How much I miss her even though I still dont trust her Then theres a voice the wrong voice not my mothers and Im scared Katniss it says Katniss can you hear me My eyes open and the sense of security vanishes Im not home not with my mother Im in a dim chilly cave my bare feet freezing despite the cover the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood The haggard pale face of a boy slides into view and after an initial jolt of alarm I feel better Peeta Hey he says Good to see your eyes again How long have I been out I ask Not sure I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood he says I think its stopped finally but I wouldnt sit up or anything I gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and I drink thirstily Youre better I say Much better Whatever you shot into my arm did the trick he says By this morning almost all the swelling inmy leg was gone Hedoesnt seem angry about my tricking him drugging him and running off to the feast Maybe Im just too beatup and Ill hear about it later when Im stronger But for the moment hes all gentleness Did you eat I ask Im sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before I realized it might have to last a while Dont worry Im back on a strict diet he says No its good You need to eat Ill go hunting soon I say Not too soon all right he says You just let me take care of you for a while I dont really seem to have much choice Peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin Your boots and socks are still damp and the weathers not helping much he says Theres a clap of thunder and I see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rock above me I wonder what brought on this storm I mean whos the target says PeetaCato and Thresh I say without thinking Foxface will be in her den somewhere and Clove    She cut me an then    My voice trails off I know Cloves dead I saw it in the sky last night h says Did you kill her No Thresh broke her skull with a rock I say Lucky he didnt catch you too says Peeta The memory of the feast returns fullforce and I feel sick He did But he let me go Then of course I have to tell him About things Ive kept to myself because he was too sick to ask and I wasnt ready to relive anyway Like the explosion and my ear and Rues dying and the boy from District  and the bread All of which leads to what happened with Thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts He let you go because he didnt want to owe you anything asks Peeta in disbelief Yes I dont expect you to understand it Youve always had enough But if youd lived in the Seam I wouldnt have to explain I say And dont try Obviously Im too dim to get it Its like the bread How I never seem to get over owing you for that I say The bread What From when we were kids he says I think we can let that go I mean you just brought me back from the dead But you didnt know me We had never even spoken Besides its the first gift thats always the hardest to pay back I wouldnt even have been here to do it if you hadnt helpedme then I say Why did you anyway Why You know why Peeta says I give my head a slight painful shake Haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing Haymitch I ask Whats he got to do with it Nothing Peeta says So Cato and Thresh huh I guess its too much to hope that theyll simultaneously destroy each other But the thought only upsets me I think we would like Thresh I think hed be our friend back in District Twelve I say Then lets hope Cato killshim so we dont have to says Peeta grimly I dont want Cato to kill Thresh at all I dont want anyone else to die But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors go around saying in the arena Despite my best efforts I can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes Peeta looks at me in concern What is it Are you in a lot of pain I give him another answer because it is equally true but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a terminal one I want to go home Peeta I say plaintively like a small child You will I promise he says and bends over to give me a kiss I want to go home now I say Tell you what You go back to sleep and dream of home And youll be there for real before you know it lie says Okay Okay I whisperWake me if you need me to keep watch Im good and rested thanks to you and Haymitch Besides who knows how long this will last he says What does he mean The storm The brief respite ii brings us The Games themselves I dont know but Im ion sad and tired to ask Its evening when Peeta wakes me again The rain has turned to a downpour sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it from me I feel a bit better able to sit up without getting too dizzy and Im absolutely famished So is Peeta Its clear hes been waiting for me to wake up to eat and is eager to get started Theres not much left Two pieces of groosling a small mishmash of roots and a handful of dried fruit Should we try and ration it Peeta asks No lets just finish it The grooslings getting old anyway and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoiled food I say dividing the food into two equal piles We try and eat slowly but were both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes My stomach is in no way satisfied Tomorrows a hunting day I say I wont be much help with that Peeta says Ive never hunted before Ill kill and you cook I say And you can always gather I wish there was some sort of bread bush out theresays Peeta The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still warm I say with a sigh Here chew these I hand him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth Its hard to even see the projection in the sky but its clear enough to know there were no more deaths today So Cato and Thresh havent had it out yet Where did Thresh go I mean whats on the far side of the circle I ask Peeta A field As far as you can see its full of grasses as high as my shoulders I dont know maybe some of them are grain There are patches of different colors But there are no paths says Peeta I bet some of them are grain I bet Thresh knows which ones too I say Did you go in there No Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass It has a sinister feeling to it Every time I look at that field all I can think of are hidden things Snakes andrabid animals and quicksand Peeta says There could be anything in there I dont say so but Peetas words remind me of the warnings they give us about not going beyond the fence in District  I cant help for a moment comparing him with Gale who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat Threshcertainly did Its not that Peetas soft exactly and hes proved hes not a coward But there are things you dont question too much I guess when your home always smells like baking bread whereas Gale questions everything What would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day Would it shock him The things we say about Panem Gales tirades against the Capitol Maybe there is a bread bush in that field I say Maybe thats why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the Games Either that or hes got very generous sponsors says Peeta I wonder what wed have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread I raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesnt know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago One kiss equals one pot of broth Its not the sort of thing I can blurt out either To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all Somehow believably Ive got to get things back on track Something simple to start with I reach out and take his hand Well he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out I say mischievously Yeah about that says Peeta entwining his fingers in mine Dont try something likethat again Or what I ask Or    Or    He cant think of anything good Just give me a minute Whats the problem I say with a grin The problem is were both still alive Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing says Peeta I did do the right thing I say No Just dont Katniss His grip tightens hurting my hand and theres real anger in his voice Dont die for me You wont be doing me any favors All right Im startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity for getting food so I try to keep up Maybe I did it for myself Peeta did you ever think of that Maybe you arent the only one who    Who worries about    What it would be like if   I fumble Im not as smooth with words as Peeta And while I was talking the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and I realized how much I dont want him to die And its not about the sponsors And its not about what will happen back home And its not just that I dont want to be alone Its him I do not want to lose the boy with the bread If what Katniss he says softly I wish I could pull the shutters closed blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of Panem Even if it means losing food Whatever Im feeling its no ones business but mine Thats exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of Isay evasively although Haymitch never said anything of the kind In fact hes probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment But Peeta somehow catches it Then Ill just have to fill in the blanks myself he says and moves in to me This is the first kiss that were both fully aware of Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest Warm and curious This is the first kiss that makes me want another But I dont get it Well I do get a second kiss but its just a light one on the tip of my nose because Peetas been distracted I think your wound is bleeding again Come on lie down its bedtime anyway he says My socks are dry enough to wear now I make Peeta put his jacket back on The damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones so he must be half frozen I insist on taking the first watch too although neither of us think its likely anyone will come in this weather But he wont agree unless Im in the bag too and Im shivering so hard that its pointless to object In stark contrast to two nights ago when I felt Peeta was a million miles away Im struck by his immediacy now As we settle in he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow the other restsprotectively over me even when he goes to sleep No one has held me like this in such a long time Since my father died and I stopped trusting my mother no one elses arms have made me feel this safe With the aid of the glasses I lie watching the drips of water splatter on the cave floor Rhythmic and lulling Several times I drift off briefly and then snap awake guilty and angry with myself After three or four hours I cant help it I have to rouse Peeta because I cant keep my eyes open He doesnt seem to mind Tomorrow when its dry Ill find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace I promise as I drift off But tomorrow is no better in terms of weather The deluge continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all away The thunders so powerful it seems to shake the ground Peetas considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food but I tell him in this storm it would be pointless He wont be able to see three feet in front of his face and hell only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles He knows Im right but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful The day drags on turning into evening and theres no break in the weather Haymitch is our only hope but nothing is forthcoming either from lack of money everything will cost an exorbitant amount or because hesdissatisfied with our performance Probably the latter Id be the first to admit were not exactly riveting today Starving weak from injuries trying not to reopen wounds Were sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag yes but mostly to keep warm The most exciting thingeither of us does is nap Im not really sure how to ramp up the romance The kiss last night was nice but working up to another will take some forethought There are girls in the Seam some of the merchant girls too who navigate these waters so easily But Ive never had much time or use for it Anyway just a kiss isnt enough anymore clearly because if it was wed have gotten food last night My instincts tell me Haymitch isnt just looking for physical affection he wants something more personal The sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview Im rotten at it but Peetas not Maybe the best approach is to get him talking Peeta I say lightly You said at the interview youd had a crush on me forever When did forever start Oh lets see I guess the first day of school We were five You had on a red plaid dress and your hair    It was in two braids instead of one My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up Peeta says Your father Why I ask He said See that little girl I wanted to marry her mother but she ran off with a coal miner Peeta says What Youre making that up I exclaim No true story Peeta says And I said A coal miner Why did she want a coal miner if she couldve had you And he said Because when he sings    Even the birds stop to listen Thats true They do I mean they did I say Im stunned and surprisingly moved thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing my own dismissal of music might not really be that I think its a waste of time It might be because it reminds me too much of my father So that day in music assembly the teacher asked who knew the valley song Your hand shot right up in the air She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us And I swear every bird outside the windows fell silent Peeta says Oh please I say laughing No it happened And right when your song ended I knew just like your mother I was a goner Peeta says Then for the next eleven years I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you Without success I add Without success So in a way my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck says Peeta For a moment Im almost foolishlyhappy and then confusion sweeps over me Because were supposed to be making up this stuff playing at being in love not actually being in love But Peetas story has a ring of truth to it That part about my father and the birds And I did sing the first day of school although I dont remember the song And that red plaid dress    There was one a handmedown to Prim that got washed to rags after my fathers death It would explain another thing too Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day So if those details are true    Could it all be true You have a    Remarkable memory I say haltingly I remember everything about you says Peeta tucking a loose strand of hairbehind my ear Youre the one who wasnt paying attention I am now I say Well I dont have much competition here he says I want to draw away to close those shutters again but I know I cant Its as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my ear Say it Say it I swallow hard and get the words out You dont have much competition anywhere And this time its me who leans in Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump My bow comes up the arrow readyto fly but theres no other sound Peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop Before I can stop him lies out in the rain then handing something in to me A silver parachute attached to a basket I rip it open at once and inside theres a feast fresh rolls goat cheese apples and best of all a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice The very dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer Peeta wriggles back inside his face lit up like the sun I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve I guess so I answer But in my head I can hear Haymitchs smug if slightly exasperated words Yes thats what Im looking lot sweetheartEvery cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and cram it handful by handful into my mouth But Peetas voice stops me We better take it slow on that stew Remember the first night on the train The rich food made me sick and I wasnt even starving then Youre right And I could just inhale the whole thing I sayregretfully But I dont We are quite sensible We each have a roll half an apple and an eggsize serving of stew and rice I make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls they even sent us silverware and plates savoring each bite When we finish I stare longingly at the dish I want more Me too Tell you what We wait an hour if it stays down then we get another serving Peeta says Agreed I say Its going to be a long hour Maybe not that long says Peeta What was that you were saying just before the food arrived Something about me    No competition    Best thing that ever happened to you    I dont remember that last part I say hoping its too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush Oh thats right Thats what I was thinking he says Scoot over Im freezing I make room for him in the sleeping bag We lean back against the cave wall my head on his shoulder his arms wrapped around me I can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep up the act So since we were five you never even noticed any other girls I ask him No I noticed just about every girl but none of them made a lasting impression but you he says Im sure that would thrill your parents you liking a girl from the Seam I say Hardly But I couldnt care less Anyway if we make it back you wont be a girl from the Seam youll be a girl from theVictors Village he says Thats right If we win well each get a house in the part of town reserved for Hunger Games victors Long agowhen the Games began the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each district Of course in ours only one is occupied Most of the others have never been lived in at all A disturbing thought hits me But then our only
