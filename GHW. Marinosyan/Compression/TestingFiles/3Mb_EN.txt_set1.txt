     I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed A yellow dressinggownungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air Heheld the bowl aloft and intonedINTROIBO AD ALTARE DEIHalted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarselyCome up Kinch Come up you fearful jesuitSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and theawaking mountains Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat andshaking his head Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hairgrained and hued like pale oakBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartlyBack to barracks he said sternlyHe added in a preachers toneFor this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul andblood and ouns Slow music please Shut your eyes gents One moment Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles Silence allHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call thenpaused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points Chrysostomos Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calmThanks old chap he cried briskly That will do nicely Switch off thecurrent will youHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watchergathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middleages A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lipsThe mockery of it he said gaily Your absurd name an ancient GreekHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapetlaughing to himself Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neckBuck Mulligans gay voice went

going to stay in this towerBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulderGod isnt he dreadful he said frankly A ponderous Saxon He thinksyoure not a gentleman God these bloody English Bursting with moneyand indigestion Because he comes from Oxford You know Dedalus youhave the real Oxford manner He cant make you out O my name for youis the best Kinch the knifebladeHe shaved warily over his chinHe was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said Where ishis guncaseA woful lunatic Mulligan said Were you in a funkI was Stephen said with energy and growing fear Out here in

lather on his razorblade He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastilyScutter he cried thicklyHe came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket saidLend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razorStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatlyThen gazing over the handkerchief he saidThe bards noserag A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreenYou can almost taste it cant youHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay hisfair

Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with youSomeone killed her Stephen said gloomilyYou could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying motherasked you Buck Mulligan said Im hyperborean as much as you But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her And you refused There is something sinister in you He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek A tolerantsmile curled his lipsBut a lovely mummer he murmured to himself Kinch the loveliestmummer of them allHe shaved evenly and with care in silence seriouslyStephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoatsleeve Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heartSilently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faintodour of wetted ashes Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomitingBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorbladeAh poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice I must give you a shirt anda few noserags How are the secondhand breeksThey fit well enough Stephen answeredBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlipThe mockery of it he said

his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skinStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyesThat fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan saysyou have gpi Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman Generalparalysis of the insaneHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunkLook at yourself he said you dreadful bardStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleftby a crooked crack Hair on end As he and others see me Who chose thisface for me This dogsbody to rid of vermin It asks me tooI pinched it out of the skivvys room Buck Mulligan said It does herall right The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi Leadhim not into temptation And her name is UrsulaLaughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyesThe rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said IfWilde were only alive to see youDrawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitternessIt is a symbol of Irish art The cracked lookingglass of a servantBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust themIts not fair to tease you like that Kinch is it he said kindly Godknows you have more spirit than any of themParried again He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his Thecold

the snout of a sleeping whale Stephen freed his armquietlyDo you wish me to tell you he askedYes what is it Buck Mulligan answered I dont remember anythingHe looked in Stephens face as he spoke A light wind passed hisbrow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyesStephen depressed by his own voice saidDo you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeathBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and saidWhat Where I cant remember anything I remember only ideas andsensations Why What happened in the name of GodYou were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to getmore hot water Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom She asked you who was in your roomYes Buck Mulligan said What did I say I forgetYou said

lifting hisbrowsCan you recall brother is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the UpanishadsI doubt it said Stephen gravelyDo you now Buck Mulligan said in the same tone Your reasons prayI fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of MaryAnnBuck Mulligans face smiled with delightCharming he

and asked blandlyIs this the day for your monthly wash KinchThen he said to HainesThe unclean bard makes a point of washing once a monthAll Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let

will let meSpeaking to me They wash and tub and scrub Agenbite of inwitConscience Yet heres a spotThat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced goodBuck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of toneWait till you hear him on Hamlet HainesWell I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came inWould I make any money by it Stephen askedHaines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock saidI dont know Im sureHe strolled out to the doorway Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigourYou put your hoof in it now What did you say that forWell Stephen said The problem is to get money From whom From themilkwoman or from him Its a toss up I thinkI blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibesI see little hope Stephen said from her or from himBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens armFrom me Kinch he saidIn a suddenly changed tone he addedTo tell you the Gods truth I think youre right Damn all else theyare good for Why dont you play them as I do To hell with them all Letus get out of the kipHe stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gownsaying resignedlyMulligan is stripped of his garmentsHe emptied his pockets on to the tableTheres your snotrag he saidAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to themchiding them and to his dangling watchchain His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief God wellsimply have to dress the character I want puce gloves and green bootsContradiction Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradictmyself Mercurial Malachi A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghandsAnd theres your Latin quarter hat he saidStephen picked it up and put it on Haines called to them from thedoorwayAre you coming you fellowsIm ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door Come outKinch You have eaten all we left I suppose Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrowAnd going forth he met ButterlyStephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them outand as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit He put the huge key in his inner pocketAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan askedDid you bring the keyI have it Stephen said preceding themHe walked on Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grassesDown sir How dare you sirHaines askedDo you pay rent for this towerTwelve quid Buck Mulligan saidTo the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulderThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at lastRather bleak in wintertime I should say Martello you call itBilly Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were onthe sea But ours is the omphalosWhat is your idea of Hamlet Haines asked StephenNo no Buck Mulligan shouted in pain Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up Wait tillI have a few pints in me firstHe turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoatYou couldnt manage it under three pints Kinch could youIt has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longerYou pique my curiosity Haines said amiably Is it some paradoxPooh Buck Mulligan said We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxesIts quite simple He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfatherWhat Haines said beginning to point at Stephen He himselfBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bendingin loose laughter said to Stephens earO shade of Kinch the elder Japhet in search of a fatherWere always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines And it israther long to tellBuck Mulligan walking forward again raised his handsThe sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he saidI mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA ISNT ITBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attiresIts a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt againEyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudentThe seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the MuglinsI read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemusedThe Father and the Son idea The Son striving to be atoned with theFatherBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face Helooked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety Hemoved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD    MY MOTHERS A JEW MY FATHERS A BIRD    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARYHe held up a forefinger of warning  IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAINHe tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and runningforward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYEHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole flutteringhis winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet criesHaines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephenand saidWe oughtnt to laugh I suppose Hes rather blasphemous Im not abeliever myself that is to say Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow doesnt it What did he call it Joseph the JoinerThe ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answeredO Haines said you have heard it beforeThree times a day after meals Stephen said drilyYoure not a believer are you Haines asked I mean a believer in thenarrow sense of the word Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal GodTheres only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen saidHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone He sprang it open with his thumb and offered itThank you Stephen said taking a cigaretteHaines helped himself and snapped the case to He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang itopen too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his handsYes of course he said as they went on again Either you believe oryou dont isnt it Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod You dont stand for that I supposeYou behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horribleexample of

wavering line along thepath They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark He wants thatkey It is mine I paid the rent Now I eat his salt bread Give him thekey too All He will ask for it That

seems to meI am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an ItalianItalian Haines saidA crazy queen old and jealous Kneel down before meAnd a third Stephen said there is who wants me for

hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleadingOn his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshapedrecent and damp as a snails

Mychildhood bends beside me Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly Mine is far and his secret as our eyes Secrets silent stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of

cried continually without listeningCochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen saidWill you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restoreorder hereAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternlyWhat is the matter What is it nowTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many formsclosed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the

ignorance They actedaccording to their lightsFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the NorthCircular road It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such animportant thoroughfare

Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of adreadful catastrophe in New York In America those things werecontinually happening Unfortunate people to die like that unpreparedStill an act of perfect contritionFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergins publichouse against thewindow of which two unlabouring men lounged They saluted him andwere salutedFather Conmee passed H J ONeills funeral

bargeman with a hat of dirtystraw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar abovehim It was idyllic and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of theCreator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out andbring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor peopleOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee SJ of saintFrancis Xaviers church upper Gardiner street stepped on to an outwardbound tramOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas DudleyC C of saint Agathas church north William street on to NewcomenbridgeAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward boundtram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud IslandFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tuckedwith care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings asixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into hispurse Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspectorusually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticketThe solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmeeexcessive for a journey so short and cheap Father Conmee liked cheerfuldecorumIt was a peaceful day The gentleman with the glasses opposite FatherConmee had finished explaining and looked down His wife FatherConmee supposed A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentlemanwith the glasses She raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gentlytiptapping  her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinilysweetlyFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car He perceived alsothat the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge ofthe seatFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in themouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky headAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go anold woman rose suddenly from her place to alight The conductor pulledthe bellstrap to stay the car for her She passed out with her basket anda marketnet and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net andbasket down and Father Conmee thought that as she had nearly passedthe end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had alwaysto be told twice BLESS YOU MY CHILD that they have been absolved PRAYFOR ME But they had so many worries in life so many cares poorcreaturesFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips atFather ConmeeFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellowmen and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver SJ and the African missionand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brownand yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their lasthour came like a thief in the night That book by the Belgian jesuit LENOMBRE DES ELUS seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea Those weremillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom thefaith had not DV been brought But they were Gods souls created byGod It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost awaste if one might sayAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted was saluted by theconductor and

the seas adjoiningThen came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one dayThose were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old timesin the baronyFather Conmee walking thought

ample underleaves The sky showed him a flock ofsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind MOUTONNER the Frenchsaid A just and homely wordFather Conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoningclouds over Rathcoffey His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubbleof Clongowes field He walked there reading in the evening and heard thecries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet eveningHe was their rector his reign was mildFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary outAn ivory bookmark told him the pageNones He should have read that

to murmur to himself in a faltering undertoneGod blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart Blimey itmakes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when I sees her cause Ithinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down Limehouse waySo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and thecorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speaktheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone fora quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump thathe cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and theantitreating league and drink the curse of Ireland Antitreatingis about the size of it Gob hed let you pour all manner of drinkdown his throat till the Lord would call him before youd eversee the froth of his pint And

badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lotof colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medalsand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolaghentertainment dont be talking Ireland sober is Ireland free And thenan old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougersshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of And one or two skypilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the femaleshitting below the beltSo howandever as I was saying the old dog seeing the tin was emptystarts mousing around by Joe and me Id train him by

andgrousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and thehydrophobia dropping out of his jawsAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture amongthe lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of notmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by thefamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the SOBRIQUET ofGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends andacquaintances Owen Garry The exhibition which is the result of years oftraining by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprisesamong other achievements the recitation of verse Our greatest livingphonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stoneunturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and hasfound it bears a STRIKING resemblance the italics are ours to the rannsof ancient Celtic bards We are not speaking so much of those delightfullovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under thegraceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised thebookloving world but rather as a contributor D O C points out in aninteresting communication published by an evening contemporary of theharsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusionsof the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a moremodern lyrist at present very much in the public eye We subjoin aspecimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholarwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose thoughwe believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rathermore than an indication The metrical system of the canine originalwhich recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules ofthe Welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe ourreaders will agree that the spirit has been well caught Perhapsit should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owensverse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestiveof suppressed rancour    THE CURSE OF MY CURSES    SEVEN DAYS EVERY DAY    AND SEVEN DRY THURSDAYS    ON YOU BARNEY KIERNAN    HAS NO SUP OF WATER    TO

like a shot off a shovel          The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysteriousembrace Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of alltoo fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proudpromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay onthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and last but not least on thequiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness thevoice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to thestormtossed heart of man Mary star of the seaThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the eveningscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly Many a time and oftwere they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chatbeside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine Cissy Caffrey andEdy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and JackyCaffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps tomatch and the name HMS Belleisle printed on both For Tommy andJacky Caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiledtwins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merryfaces and endearing ways about them They were dabbling in the sand withtheir spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing withtheir big coloured ball happy as the day was long And Edy Boardman wasrocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that younggentleman fairly chuckled with delight He was but eleven months and ninedays old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp hisfirst babyish words Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fatlittle plucks and the dainty dimple in his chinNow baby Cissy Caffrey said Say out big big I want a drink ofwaterAnd baby prattled after herA jink a jink a jawboCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of childrenso patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got totake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose andpromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrupon What a persuasive power that girl had But to be sure baby Boardmanwas as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib None ofyour spoilt beauties Flora MacFlimsy sort was Cissy CaffreyA truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh inher gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips agirl lovable in the extreme And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaintlanguage of little brotherBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommyand Master Jacky Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exceptionto this golden rule The apple of discord was a certain castle of sandwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrongthat it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like theMartello tower had But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky wasselfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little Irishmans houseis his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that thewouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castletoo Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew theattention of the girl friendsCome here Tommy his sister called imperatively At once And youJacky for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand Wait till I catchyou for thatHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call fortheir big sisters word was law with the twins And in a sad plight he wastoo after his misadventure His little manowar top and unmentionableswere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothingover lifes tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand wasto be seen on his smart little suit Still the blue eyes were glisteningwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness andshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was nearhim she wouldnt be far from him her eyes dancing in admonitionNasty bold Jacky she criedShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winninglyWhats your name Butter and creamTell us who is your sweetheart spoke Edy Boardman Is Cissy yoursweetheartNao tearful Tommy saidIs Edy Boardman your sweetheart Cissy queriedNao Tommy saidI know Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance fromher shortsighted eyes I know who is Tommys sweetheart Gerty isTommys sweetheartNao Tommy said on the verge of tearsCissys quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whisperedto Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where thegentleman couldnt see and to mind he didnt wet his new tan shoesBut who was GertyGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions lost inthought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair aspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see She waspronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said shewas more a Giltrap than a MacDowell Her figure was slight and gracefulinclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking oflate had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welchsfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to getand that tired feeling The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritualin its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupidsbow Greekly perfect Her hands were of finely veined alabasterwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointmentscould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid glovesin bed or take a milk footbath either Bertha Supple told that onceto Edy Boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggersdrawn with Gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffsfrom time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not tolet on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed neverspeak to her again No Honour where honour is due There was aninnate refinement a languid queenly HAUTEUR about Gerty whichwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instepHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree inher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good educationGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in theland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow andpatrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirsto her Mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent toher softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaningthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charmfew could resist Why have women such eyes of witchery Gertys were ofthe bluest Irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressivebrows Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive It wasMadame Vera Verity directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the PrincessNovelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave thathaunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion andshe had never regretted it Then there was blushing scientifically curedand how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face butyour nose That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one ButGertys crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair It was dark brownwith a natural wave in it She had cut it that very morning on accountof the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion ofluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too Thursday for wealth And justnow at Edys words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintestrosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlishshyness that of a surety Gods fair land of Ireland did not holdher equalFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes She wasabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue Inclinationprompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent The pretty lipspouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous littlelaugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning She knewright well noone better what made squinty Edy say that because of himcooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel As perusual somebodys nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycleoff the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of herwindow Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studyinghard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he wasgoing to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he leftthe high school like his brother W E Wylie who was racing in thebicycle races in Trinity college university Little recked he perhapsfor what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimespiercing to the core Yet he was young and perchance he mightlearn to love her in time They were protestants in his familyand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the BlessedVirgin and then Saint Joseph But he was undeniably handsome with anexquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman theshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would knowanywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle atthe lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of thosegood cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she andthat was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever becausehe didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a gardenGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary ofDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might beout A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because itwas expected in the LADYS PICTORIAL that electric blue would be wornwith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocketin which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with herfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and anavy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim gracefulfigure to perfection She wore a coquettish little love of a hat ofwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggbluechenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone All Tuesdayweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at lastshe found what she wanted at Clerys summer sales the very it slightlyshopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny Shedid it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on thensmiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to herAnd when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that thatwould take the shine out of some people she knew Her shoes were thenewest thing in footwear Edy Boardman prided herself that she was veryPETITE but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell a five and neverwould ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle overher higharched instep Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfectproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more ofher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and widegarter tops As for undies they were Gertys chief care and who that knowsthe fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though Gerty wouldnever see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her She hadfour dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments andnighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbonsrosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herselfand blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed themand she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trustthose washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the thingsShe was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her owncolour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhereon her because the green she wore that day week brought grief becausehis father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibitionand because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she wasdressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside outand that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things oninside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so longas it wasnt of a FridayAnd yet and yet That strained look on her face A gnawing sorrow isthere all the time Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worldsto be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way totears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough nottoo much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror You arelovely Gerty it said The paly light of evening falls upon a faceinfinitely sad and wistful Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain Yes she hadknown from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has beenarranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T C Dbecause the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie and inthe fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuousconfection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be He wastoo young to understand He would not believe in love a womansbirthright The night of the party long ago in Stoers he was still inshort trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waistshe went white to the very lips He called her little one in a strangelyhusky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the endof her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark aboutrefreshments Impetuous fellow Strength of character had never been ReggyWylies strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must bea man among men But waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leapyear too and would soon be over No prince charming is her beau ideal tolay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with astrong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightlyflecked with grey and who would understand take her in his shelteringarms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate natureand comfort her with a long long kiss It would be like heaven For sucha one she yearns this balmy summer eve With all the heart of her shelongs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sicknessin health till death us two part from this to this day forwardAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she wasjust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself hislittle wife to be Then they could talk about her till they went blue inthe face Bertha Supple too and Edy little spitfire because she wouldbe twentytwo in November She would care for him with creature comfortstoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked thatfeeling of hominess Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue andqueen Anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions fromall because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in thefine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then creamthe milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt likethe eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often shewondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses andthey would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures andengravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltraps lovely dogGarryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for thechairs and that silver toastrack in Clerys summer jumble sales like theyhave in rich houses He would be tall with broad shoulders she had alwaysadmired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under hiscarefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continentfor their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settleddown in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning theywould both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own twoselves and before he went out to business he would give his dear littlewifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyesEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes sothen she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to runoff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight But Tommysaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with theball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but Tommy said it washis ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if youplease The temper of him O he was a man already was little TommyCaffrey since he was out of pinnies Edy told him no no and to be off nowwith him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to himYoure not my sister naughty Tommy said Its my ballBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up look up high at herfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand andTommy after it in full career having won the dayAnything for a quiet life laughed CissAnd she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heresthe lord mayor heres his two horses heres his gingerbread carriageand here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin But Edygot as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that fromeveryone always petting himId like to give him something she said so I would where I wont sayOn the beeoteetom laughed Cissy merrilyGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissysaying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of herlife to say flushing a deep rosy red and Edy Boardman said she was surethe gentleman opposite heard what she said But not a pin cared CissLet him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of hernose Give it to him too on the same place as quick as Id look at himMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls You had to laugh at hersometimes For instance when she asked you would you have some moreChinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mensfaces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when shewanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit tothe Miss White That was just like Cissycums O and will you ever forgether the evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the burnedcork moustache and walked down Tritonville road smoking a cigaretteThere was none to come up to her for fun But she was sincerity itselfone of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of yourtwofaced things too sweet to be wholesomeAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and thepealing anthem of the organ It was the mens temperance retreat conductedby the missioner the reverend John Hughes S J rosary sermon andbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament They were there gatheredtogether without distinction of social class and a most edifyingspectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the wavesafter the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet ofthe immaculate reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loretobeseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar wordsholy Mary holy virgin of virgins How sad to poor Gertys earsHad her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink bytaking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in PearsonsWeekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none Over andover had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brownstudy without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazingout of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rustybucket thinking But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearthsand homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days Nay she had evenwitnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance andhad seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forgethimself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gertyknew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way ofkindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the lowAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerfulVirgin most merciful And Gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard hercompanions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman offSandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so likehimself passing along the strand taking a short walk You never saw himany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for afather because he was too old or something or on account of his face itwas a palpable case of Doctor Fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimpleson it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose Poor fatherWith all his faults she loved him still when he sang TELL ME MARY HOW TOWOO THEE or MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE and they had stewed cocklesand lettuce with Lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang THEMOON HATH RAISED with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried Godhave mercy on him from a stroke Her mothers birthday that was andCharley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs andPatsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group takenNoone would have thought the end was so near Now he was laid to restAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest ofhis days and he couldnt even go to the funeral on account of the gout andshe had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from hisoffice about Catesbys cork lino artistic standard designs fit for apalace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the homeA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the housea ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in goldAnd when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was itrubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didnt likeher mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thingthey ever had words about taking snuff Everyone thought the world of herfor her gentle ways It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main everynight and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where shenever forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocerschristmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman inthe costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering abunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her latticewindow You could see there was a story behind it The colours were donesomething lovely She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitudeand the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocratShe often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certainpurpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers withthe sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found outin Walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrapabout the halcyon days what they meantThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till atlast Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no gettingbehind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could downtowards the seaweedy rocks Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow tovoice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting thereby himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball Our twochampions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid troubleCissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please Thegentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strandtowards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right underGertys skirt near the little pool by the rock The twins clamoured againfor it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it soGerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt comerolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and CissylaughedIf you fail try again Edy Boardman saidGerty smiled assent and bit her lip A delicate pink crept into herpretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted herskirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jollygood kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towardsthe shingle Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attentionon account of the gentleman opposite looking She felt the warm flush adanger signal always with Gerty MacDowell surging and flaming into hercheeks Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual butnow under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the facethat met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemedto her the saddest she had ever seenThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted andwith it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain oforiginal sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray forus vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose And carewornhearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erredand wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright withhope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the greatsaint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary the most pious Virginsintercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those whoimplored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by herThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles ofchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers Cissy Caffrey played withbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air Peepshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissygone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my worddidnt the little chap enjoy that And then she told him to say papaSay papa baby Say pa pa pa pa pa pa paAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent foreleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of healtha perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to besomething great they saidHaja ja ja hajaCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to situp properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried outholy saint Denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanketthe other way under him Of course his infant majesty was mostobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know itHabaa baaaahabaaa baaaaAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks It was all nouse soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about thegeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss always readywitted gave himin his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen wasquickly appeasedGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out ofthat and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little bratsof twins She gazed out towards the distant sea It was like the paintingsthat man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and sucha pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and theclouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music likethat and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like akind of waft And while she gazed her heart went pitapat Yes it was herhe was looking at and there was meaning in his look His eyes burned intoher as though they would search her through and through read her verysoul Wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trustthem People were so queer She could see at once by his dark eyes and hispale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo shehad of Martin Harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which shepreferred because she wasnt stagestruck like Winny Rippingham thatwanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but shecould not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly RETROUSSE fromwhere he was sitting He was in deep mourning she could see that and thestory of a haunting sorrow was written on his face She would have givenworlds to know what it was He was looking up so intently so still andhe saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel bucklesof her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes downShe was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockingsthinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away Here was that ofwhich she had so often dreamed It was he who mattered and there was joyon her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that hewas like noone else The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him herdreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him If he hadsuffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had beenhimself a sinner a wicked man she cared not Even if he was a protestantor methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her Therewere wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm She was a womanly womannot like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclistsshowing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all toforgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forgetthe memory of the past Then mayhap he would embrace her gently like areal man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girliefor herself aloneRefuge of sinners Comfortress of the afflicted ORA PRO NOBIS Wellhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy cannever be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for theafflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heartGerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glasswindows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of theblessed Virgins sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon OHanlon atthe altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down He lookedalmost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark andhis hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nunin their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novenaof Saint Dominic He told her that time when she told him about that inconfession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could seenot to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we wereall subject to natures laws he said in this life and that that was nosin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God he saidand that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it doneunto me according to Thy Word He was so kind and holy and often and oftenshe thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroideredfloral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock shenoticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came outof a little house to tell the time the day she went there about theflowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know whatsort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views ofDublin or some placeThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jackythrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it Littlemonkeys common as ditchwater Someone ought to take them and give thema good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both ofthem And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because theywere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drownedJacky TommyNot they What a great notion they had So Cissy said it was the verylast time shed ever bring them out She jumped up and called them and sheran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a goodenough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerryshe was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because itwasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it She ranwith long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt atthe side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboyabout Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thoughtshe had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runnershe ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoatrunning and her skinny shanks up as far as possible It would haveserved her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentallyon purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her looktall and got a fine tumble TABLEAU That would have been a very charmingexpose for a gentleman like that to witnessQueen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saintsthey prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handedthe thurible to Canon OHanlon and he put in the incense and censed theBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she wasitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnt becauseshe thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake inall her life because Gerty could see without looking that he nevertook his eyes off of her and then Canon OHanlon handed the thuribleback to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacramentand the choir began to sing the TANTUM ERGO and she just swung her footin and out in time as the music rose and fell to the TANTUMER GOSACRAMEN TUM Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrowsof Georges street on the Tuesday no the Monday before Easter and therewasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparentand not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor formthe cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the differencefor himselfCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball withher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streeltugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only afortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanginglike a caricature Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle herhair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen ona girls shouldersa radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening inits sweetness You would have to travel many a long mile before you founda head of hair the like of that She could almost see the swift answeringflash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerveShe put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim andswung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught theexpression in his eyes He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey Herwomans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at thethought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colourof her face became a glorious roseEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gertyhalf smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse thebaby Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was whynoone could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern ofhers And she said to GertyA penny for your thoughtsWhat replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teethI was only wondering was it lateBecause she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and theirbabby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave agentle hint about its being late And when Cissy came up Edy asked her thetime and Miss Cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissingtime time to kiss again But Edy wanted to know because they were told tobe in earlyWait said Cissy Ill run ask my uncle Peter over there whats the timeby his conundrumSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take hishand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with hiswatchchain looking up at the church Passionate nature though he wasGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself One moment hehad been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and thenext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressedin every line of his distinguishedlooking figureCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was theright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to itand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry hiswatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sunwas set His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke inmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tonesCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle saidhis waterworks were out of orderThen they sang the second verse of the TANTUM ERGO and CanonOHanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down andhe told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fireto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and shecould see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works andshe swung her leg more in and out in time It was getting darker but hecould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch orwhatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands backinto his pockets She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her andshe knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her staysthat that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when sheclipped her hair on account of the moon His dark eyes fixed themselveson her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at hershrine If ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionategaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face It is for youGertrude MacDowell and you know itEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gertynoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect becauseit was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push upthe pushcar and Cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair tomake herself attractive of course and Canon OHanlon stood up with hiscope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to readoff and he read out PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS and Edy and Cissy weretalking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could paythem back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politenesswhen Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing herover Gerty winced sharply A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes thatspoke volumes of scorn immeasurable It hurtO yes it cut deep becauseEdy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would woundlike the confounded little cat she was Gertys lips parted swiftly toframe the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throatso slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artistmight have dreamed of She had loved him better than he knewLighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would neverunderstand what he had meant to her and for an instant there wasin the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears Their eyes wereprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back insympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to seeO responded Gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud headflashed up I can throw my cap at who I like because its leap yearHer words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of theringdove but they cut the silence icily There was that in her youngvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled withAs for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could justchuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would shecast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcardinto a dozen pieces And if ever after he dared to presume shecould give him one look of measured scorn that would make himshrivel up on the spot Miss puny little Edys countenance fell tono slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black asthunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it thelittle kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousyand they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another spherethat she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody elsetoo that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipeand smoke itEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissytucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time toobecause the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior AndCissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to godeedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleefuleyes and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy andbaby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to alland sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bibO my Puddeny pie protested Ciss He has his bib destroyedThe slight CONTRETEMPS claimed her attention but in two twos she setthat little matter to rightsGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough andEdy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it wasflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed itoff with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction becausejust then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashorebecause Canon OHanlon was up on the altar with the veil that FatherConroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the BlessedSacrament in his handsHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse ofErin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a batflew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with atiny lost cry And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses sopicturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it waseasier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going hisrounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shadyTritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near herwindow where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in thatbook THE LAMPLIGHTER by Miss Cummins author of MABEL VAUGHAN andother tales For Gerty had her dreams that noone knew of She loved toread poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovelyconfession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in shelaid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not erron the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean It was thereshe kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs herchild of Mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine heralabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things camehome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts writtenin it in violet ink that she bought in Helys of Dame Street forshe felt that she too could write poetry if she could only expressherself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she hadcopied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs ARTTHOU REAL MY IDEAL it was called by Louis J Walsh Magherafelt andafter there was something about TWILIGHT WILT THOU EVER and ofttimesthe beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had mistedher eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slippingby for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew sheneed fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkeyhill and she always tried to conceal it But it must end she feltIf she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holdingback for her Love laughs at locksmiths She would make the greatsacrifice Her every effort would be to share his thoughts Dearer thanthe whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happinessThere was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he amarried man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like thenobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her putinto a madhouse cruel only to be kind But even ifwhat then Would itmake a very great difference From everything in the least indelicate herfinebred nature instinctively recoiled She loathed that sort of personthe fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that wentwith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girls honourdegrading the sex and being taken up to the police station No no notthat They would be just good friends like a big brother and sisterwithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a bigess Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the daysbeyond recall She thought she understood She would try to understandhim because men were so different The old love was waiting waitingwith little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes Heartof mine She would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heartthat told her he was her all in all the only man in all the worldfor her for love was the master guide Nothing else mattered Come whatmight she would be wild untrammelled freeCanon OHanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacleand genuflected and the choir sang LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES andthen he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over andFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasntshe coming but Jacky Caffrey called outO look CissyAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too overthe trees beside the church blue and then green and purpleIts fireworks Cissy Caffrey saidAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and thechurch helterskelter Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it andCissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldnt fall runningCome on Gerty Cissy called Its the bazaar fireworksBut Gerty was adamant She had no intention of being at their beck andcall If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she couldsee from where she was The eyes that were fastened upon her sether pulses tingling She looked at him a moment meeting his glanceand a light broke in upon her Whitehot passion was in that face passionsilent as the grave and it had made her his At last they were leftalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew hecould be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man ofinflexible honour to his fingertips His hands and face were workingand a tremour went over her She leaned back far to look up wherethe fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as notto fall back looking up and there was noone to see only him andher when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like thatsupply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the pantingof his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passionof men like that hotblooded because Bertha Supple told her once in deadsecret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that wasstaying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had picturescut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said heused to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes inthe bed But this was altogether different from a thing like thatbecause there was all the difference because she could almost feelhim draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of hishandsome lips Besides there was absolution so long as you didntdo the other thing before being married and there ought to bewomen priests that would understand without your telling out andCissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy lookin her eyes so that she too my dear and Winny Rippingham so madabout actors photographs and besides it was on account of that otherthing coming on the way it didAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned backand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and theyall saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leanedback ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flyingthrough the air a soft thing to and fro dark And she saw a long Romancandle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hushthey were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higherand she had to lean back more and more to look up after it highhigh almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divinean entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her otherthings too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skinbetter than those other pettiwidth the green four and elevenon account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and thenit went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling inevery limb from being bent so far back that he had a full viewhigh up above her knee where noone ever not even on the swing or wadingand she wasnt ashamed and he wasnt either to look in that immodest waylike that because he couldnt resist the sight of the wondrous revealmenthalf offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemenlooking and he kept on looking looking She would fain have cried to himchokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel hislips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girls love a littlestrangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the agesAnd then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O then the Romancandle burst and it was like a sigh of O and everyone cried O O inraptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads andthey shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with goldenO so lovely O soft sweet softThen all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent Ah Sheglanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance ofpiteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girlHe was leaning back against the rock behind Leopold Bloom for it is hestands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes What abrute he had been At it again A fair unsullied soul had called to himand wretch that he was how had he answered An utter cad he had beenHe of all men But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyesfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned andwandered Should a girl tell No a thousand times no That was theirsecret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none toknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the eveningto and fro and little bats dont tellCissy Caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to showwhat a great person she was and then she criedGerty Gerty Were going Come on We can see from farther upGerty had an idea one of loves little ruses She slipped a hand intoher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of coursewithout letting him and then slipped it back Wonder if hes too far toShe rose Was it goodbye No She had to go but they would meet againthere and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream ofyester eve She drew herself up to her full height Their souls met in alast lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of astrange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face She halfsmiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged ontears and then they partedSlowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand toCissy to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey to little baby Boardman It wasdarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippyseaweed She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her butwith care and very slowly becausebecause Gerty MacDowell was Tight boots No Shes lame OMr

woman that lay therein childbed The nursingwoman answered him and said that that womanwas in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unnethto bear but that now in a little it would be She said thereto that shehad seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was thatwomans birth Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew theman that time was had lived nigh that house The man hearkened to herwords for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have ofmotherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face forany man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid Ninetwelve bloodflows chiding her childlessAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and therenighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat And therecame against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept DixonAnd the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that theyhad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where thislearningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healedfor he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible anddreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve ofvolatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice And he said now thathe should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that werethere And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither forhe was a man of cautels and a subtile Also the lady was of his avis andrepreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller hadsaid thing that was false for his subtility But the learningknight wouldnot hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious tohis list and he said how it was a marvellous castle And the travellerLeopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore oflimb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime veneryAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood ofFinlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but theydurst not move more for enchantment And on this board were frightfulswords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons outof white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags thatthere abound marvellously And there were vessels that are wrought bymagic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breaththat he blases in to them like to bubbles And full fair cheer and richwas on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer And therewas a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which laystrange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that thisbe possible thing without they see it natheless they are so And thesefishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land becauseof the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepressAnd also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they makea compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid ofcertain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously liketo a vast mountain And they teach the serpents there to entwinethemselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales ofthese serpents they brew out a brewage like to meadAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halpthereto the while all they that were there drank every each And childeLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat inamity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by andanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and hisneighbour nist not of this wile And he sat down in that castle with themfor to rest him there awhile Thanked be Almighty GodThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them atthe reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing forthere was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fastSir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry thatit was whether of child or woman and I marvel said he that it be notcome or now Meseems it dureth overlong And he was ware and saw afranklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than anyof the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the oneemprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gentlyBut said he or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty andhave joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long And thefranklin that had drunken said Expecting each moment to be her nextAlso he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never noneasking nor desiring of him to drink and Now drink said he fullydelectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths healthfor he was a passing good man of his lustiness And sir Leopoldthat was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall andthat was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandlyhand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the worldone that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly inthe cup Womans woe with wonder ponderingNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to bedrunken an they might There was a sort of scholars along either side theboard that is to wit Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciables withother his fellows Lynch and Madden scholars of medicine and the franklinthat hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa one Crotthers and youngStephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board andCostello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of himerewhile gested and of all them reserved young Stephen he was the mostdrunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sirLeopold But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised tohave come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had brokehis avow And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendshipto sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languorbecalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feastedhim for that time in the honourablest manner Ruth red him love ledon with will to wander loth to leaveFor they were right witty scholars And he heard their aresouns eachgen other as touching birth and righteousness young Madden maintainingthat put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen outa matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Hornes house thatnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before herdeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case And theysaid farther she should live because in the beginning they said thewoman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of thisimagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscienceto let her die And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubtthat the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeitthe mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges didprovide no remedy A redress God grant This was scant said but all criedwith one acclaim nay by our Virgin Mother the wife should live and thebabe to die In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what withargument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompteach when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lackThen young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she wasdead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and fora vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband wouldnot let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved To whom youngStephen had these words following Murmur sirs is eke oft among layfolk Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker the one in limbogloom the other in purgefire But gramercy what of those Godpossibledsouls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the HolyGhost Very God Lord and Giver of Life For sirs he said our lustis brief We are means to those small creatures within us and naturehas other ends than we Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wisthe what ends But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he couldhave of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she wereor wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of hisspleen of lustihead Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang youngMalachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millenniumhe cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward withtheir jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and severalby saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any mannerof thing that lay in man to do Thereat laughed they all rightjocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laughtoo open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray andalso for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoeverThen spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast himout of her bosom of law of canons of Lilith patron of abortions of bignesswrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth tomouth or as Virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reekof moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain withEFFECTU SECUTO or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions ofAverroes and Moses Maimonides He said also how at the end of the secondmonth a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldethever souls for Gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which wasbut a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeththe fishermans seal even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy churchfor all ages founded All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would hein like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life A wariness ofmind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he saiddissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had everloved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with hisexperience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Churchbelike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly hescaped their questions That is truth pardy said Dixon and or I erra pregnant word Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man andhe averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for hewas of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in thattaking it appeared eftsoonsBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he stillhad pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labourand as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an onlymanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of artcould save so dark is destiny And she was wondrous stricken of heart forthat evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambswool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lieakeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now SirLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him hisfriends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness andas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for allaccounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure foryoung Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels andmurdered his goods with whoresAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood emptyso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed theirapproach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for theintentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicarof Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray Now drink we quod heof this mazer and quaff ye this mead

hospitality that wassending over Doctor Rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in allMuscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull bythe horns Come come says Mr Vincent plain dealing Hell find himselfon the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats Irish says heIrish by name and irish by nature says Mr Stephen and he sent the alepurling about an Irish bull in an English chinashop I conceive you saysMr Dixon It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmerNicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emeraldring in his nose True for you says Mr Vincent cross the tableand a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlierbull says he never shit on shamrock He had horns galore a coat ofcloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils sothat the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpinsfollowed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychainsWhat for that says Mr Dixon but before he came over farmerNicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctorswho were no better off than himself So be off now says he and do all mycousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmers blessing andwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly But the slap and theblessing stood him friend says Mr Vincent for to make up he taught him atrick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to thisday affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his earin the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holytongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the fourfields of all Ireland Another then put in his word And they dressed himsays he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle andruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all overwith spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of theroad with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the marketso that he could doss and dung to his hearts content By this timethe father of the faithful for so they called him was grown soheavy that he could scarce walk to pasture To remedy which ourcozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlapsand as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uartersto show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bullslanguage and they all after him Ay says another and so pampered was hethat he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass forhimself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a boardput up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed noticesaying By the Lord Harry Green is the grass that grows on the groundAnd says Mr Dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommonor the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowingas much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed runamok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whateverwas planted and all by lord Harrys orders There was bad blood betweenthem at first says Mr Vincent and the lord Harry called farmerNicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster thatkept seven trulls in his house and Ill meddle in his matterssays he Ill make that animal smell hell says he with the helpof that good pizzle my father left me But one evening says MrDixon when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinnerafter winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first ruleof the course was that the others were to row with pitchforkshe discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on pickingup a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sureenough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bullof the Romans BOS BOVUM which is good bog Latin for boss of theshow After that says Mr Vincent the lord Harry put his head intoa cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers andpulling it out again told them all his new name Then with the waterrunning off him he got into an old smock and skirt that hadbelonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bullslanguage to study but he could never learn a word of it except the firstpersonal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if everhe went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it uponwhat took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale ofcotton or a corkfloat In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon asfast friends as an arse and a shirt They were says Mr Stephen and theend was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as theungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselvesand their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect mannedthe yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the windput her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ranup the jolly Roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushedoff in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of AmericaWhich was the occasion says Mr Vincent of the composing by a boatswainof that

with a friendwhom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name Alec Bannonwho had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or acornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars Mr Mulligan was civilenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with aproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched onWhereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which hehad had printed that day at Mr Quinnells bearing a legend printed in fairitalics MR MALACHI MULLIGAN FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR LAMBAY ISLAND Hisproject as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idlepleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sirMilksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task forwhich our bodily organism has been framed Well let us hear of it goodmy friend said Mr Dixon I make no doubt it smacks of wenching Come beseated both Tis as cheap sitting as standing Mr Mulligan accepted ofthe invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that hehad been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes ofsterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibitionin its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of thebalance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defectscongenital or from proclivities acquired It grieved him plaguily hesaid to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and toreflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to thevilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenialcloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountablemuskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing theinestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows wereat hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weepTo curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppressionof latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worthand inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in feesimple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holderlord Talbot de Malahide a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with ourascendancy party He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farmto be named OMPHALOS with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion ofEgypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of anyfemale of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him withthe desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural Money was noobject he said nor would he take a penny for his pains The poorestkitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be theirconstructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitionswould find in him their man For his nutriment he shewed how he wouldfeed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish andconeys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highlyrecommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade ofmace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies After this homily which hedelivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put offfrom his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it They both itseems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pacehad taken water as might be observed by Mr Mulligans smallclothes of ahodden grey which was now somewhat piebald His project meanwhile wasvery favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies fromall though Mr Dixon of Marys excepted to it asking with a finicking airdid he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle Mr Mulligan however madecourt to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which asit dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support ofhis contention TALIS AC TANTA DEPRAVATIO HUJUS SECULI O QUIRITES UTMATRESFAMILIARUM NOSTRAE LASCIVAS CUJUSLIBET SEMIVIRI LIBICI

overjoyed as he was at apassage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell ithis nearest neighbour Mr Mulligan now perceiving the table asked forwhom were those loaves and fishes and seeing

replied that he was comethere about a lady now an inmate of Hornes house that was in aninteresting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetcheda deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet

create themselves wits at the cost of femininedelicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he wouldconcede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a properbreeding

while the above was goingon were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation wasas astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjecturedthe contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrongshop During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hardat a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co atBurtononTrent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of othersright opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated toattract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance He wassimply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best knownto himself which put quite an altogether different complexion onthe proceedings after the moment befores observations about boyhooddays and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions ofhis own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babeunborn Eventually however both their eyes met and as soon asit began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to helphimself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himselfand so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glassrecipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacioushole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same timehowever a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upsetany of the beer that was in it about the placeThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome ofthe course of life Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity Thedebaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on theloftiest and most vital The high hall of Hornes house had never beheld anassembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of

young poet who found a refuge from his labours ofpedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere ofSocratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated theflippant

no lureor peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of thatvoluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned forages yet to comeIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the pervertedtranscendentalism to which Mr S Dedalus Div Scep contentions wouldappear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to acceptedscientific methods Science it cannot be too often repeated deals withtangible phenomena The man of science like the man in the street has toface hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best hecan There may be it is true some questions which science cannotanswerat presentsuch as the first problem submitted by Mr L Bloom PubbCanv regarding the future determination of sex Must we accept the viewof Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual periodassert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too longneglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it asmost embryologists incline to opine such as Culpepper SpallanzaniBlumenbach Lusk Hertwig Leopold and Valenti a mixture of both Thiswould be tantamount to a cooperation one of natures favourite devicesbetween the NISUS FORMATIVUS of the nemasperm on the one hand and on theother a happily chosen position SUCCUBITUS FELIX of the passive element Theother

isundoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting tocount the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to benormative In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder isthat so

IVORY CANE WITH A VIOLETBOWKNOT A WHITE LAMBKIN PEEPS OUT OF HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET     III Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulkof the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked himup generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly neededHis Stephens mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but abit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink MrBloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry wateravailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon anexpedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabmansshelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridgewhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk andsoda or a mineral But how to get there was the rub For the nonce he wasrather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him totake some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means duringwhich Stephen repeatedly yawned So far as he could see he was rather palein the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyanceof some description which would answer in their then condition both ofthem being eded particularly Stephen always assuming that there wassuch a thing to be found Accordingly after a few such preliminaries asbrushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddyhandkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they bothwalked together along Beaver street or more properly lane as far as thefarriers and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at thecorner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thencedebouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergins But ashe confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hireanywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by somefellows inside on the spree outside the North Star hotel and there was nosymptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom who wasanything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting akind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twiceThis was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on itevidently there was nothing for it butput a good face on the matter and footit which they accordingly did So bevelling around by Mulletts and theSignal House which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in thedirection of Amiens street railway terminus Mr Bloom being handicappedby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to varythe timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though enteringthoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of themischance So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as ithappened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recentvisitation of Jupiter Pluvius they dandered along past by where the emptyvehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey As it so happened a DublinUnited Tramways Companys sandstrewer happened to be returning andthe elder man recounted to his companion A PROPOS of the incident his owntruly miraculous escape of some little while back They passed the mainentrance of the Great Northern railway station the starting point forBelfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour andpassing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to saygruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the DockTavern and in due course turned into Store street famous for itsC division police station Between this point and the high at present unlitwarehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsenassociated with Bairds the stonecutters in his mind somehow in Talbotplace first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidusAchates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourkes citybakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odourindeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary andmost indispensable Bread the staff of life earn your bread O tell me whereis fancy bread at Rourkes the bakers it is saidEn route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yetperfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in completepossession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spokea word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swellmobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as ahabitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for youngfellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits underthe influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for everycontingencyas even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick ifyou didnt look out Highly providential was the appearance on the scene ofCorny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that manin the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that hemight have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that thebridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or hebeing the solicitor rather old Wall he meant to say or Mahony whichsimply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about The reason hementioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordiallydisliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and asMr Bloom put it recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassilstreet prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot Never on the spotwhen wanted but in quiet parts of the city Pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being theywere paid to protect the upper classes Another thing he commented on wasequipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to gooff at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civiliansshould by any chance they fall out over anything You frittered away yourtime he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besideswhich the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ranaway with a lot of l s d into the bargain and the greatest danger of all waswho you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question ofstimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably agood burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond acertain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to troubleall round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of otherspractically Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephenby all his pubhunting confreres but one a most glaring piece of ratting onthe part of his brother medicos under all the circsAnd that one was Judas Stephen said who up to then had said nothingwhatsoever of any kindDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across theback of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where abrazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like oneattracted their rather lagging footsteps Stephen of his own accord stoppedfor no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by thelight emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure ofthe corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox He began toremember that this had happened or had been mentioned as havinghappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered thathe recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his fathers Gumley Toavoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridgeSomeone saluted you Mr Bloom saidA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the archessaluted again callingNightStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return thecompliment Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuchas he always believed in minding his own business moved off butnevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety thoughnot funkyish in the least Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew thatit was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothingto live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceablepedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outsidethe city proper famished loiterers of the Thames embankment categorythey might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decampwith whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments noticeyour money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged andgarrottedStephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quartersthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corleys breathredolent of rotten cornjuice Lord John Corley some called him and hisgenealogy came about in this wise He was the eldest son of inspectorCorley of the G division lately deceased who had married a certainKatherine Brophy the daughter of a Louth farmer His grandfatherPatrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publicanthere whose maiden name had been Katherine also Talbot Rumour had itthough not proved that she descended from the house of the lords Talbotde Malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence ofits kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative awoman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction ofbeing in service in the washkitchen This therefore was the reason why thestill comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressedStephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord JohnCorleyTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tellNot as much as a farthing to purchase a nights lodgings His friends hadall deserted him Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him toStephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of otheruncalledfor expressions He was out of a job and implored of Stephen totell him where on Gods earth he could get something anything at all to doNo it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that wasfostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through themother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if thewhole thing wasnt a complete fabrication from start to finish Anyhow hewas all inI wouldnt ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and God knowsIm on the rocksTherell be a job tomorrow or next day Stephen told him in a boysschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher Mr Garrett Deasy Try it You maymention my nameAh God Corley replied sure I couldnt teach in a school man I wasnever one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh I got stuck twicein the junior at the christian brothersI have no place to sleep myself Stephen informed himCorley at the first gooff was inclined to suspect it was something todo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart offthe street There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street Mrs Maloneysbut it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but MConachie toldhim you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavernstreet which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friarBacon for a bob He was starving too though he hadnt said a word about itThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near itstill Stephens feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew thatCorleys brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deservingof much credence However haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere discoetcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he gotpaid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which wasthe date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of thewherewithal was demolished But the cream of the joke was nothing wouldget it out of Corleys head that he was living in affluence and hadnt a thingto do but hand out the needful Whereas He put his hand in a pocketanyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he mightlend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at allevents and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for tohis chagrin he found his cash missing A few broken biscuits were all theresult of his investigation He tried his hardest to recollect for the momentwhether he had lost as well he might have or left because in thatcontingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact Hewas altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he triedto recollect About biscuits he dimly remembered Who now exactly gavethem he wondered or where was or did he buy However in another pockethe came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneouslyhowever as it turned outThose are halfcrowns man Corley corrected himAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be Stephen anyhow lenthim one of themThanks Corley answered youre a gentleman Ill pay you back onetime Whos that with you I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse inCamden street with Boylan the billsticker You might put in a good wordfor us to get me taken on there Id carry a sandwichboard only the girl inthe office told me theyre full up for the next three weeks man God youveto book ahead man youd think it was for the Carl Rosa I dont give ashite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeperSubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two andsix he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of BagsComisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullams theshipchandlers bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Naglesback with OMara and a little chap with a stutter the name of TigheAnyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunkand disorderly and refusing to go with the constableMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of thecobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporationwatchmans sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him washaving a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own privateaccount while Dublin slept He threw an odd eye at the same time now andthen at Stephens anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if hehad seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in aposition to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when Being alevelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewdobservation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchywearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity Palpably hewas one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a questionof one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to putit a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chancedto be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a finewould be a very rara avis altogether In any case he had a consummateamount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night ormorning Pretty thick that was certainlyThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who withhis practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to theblandiloquence of the other parasite Alluding to the encounter he saidlaughingly Stephen that isHe is down on his luck He asked me to ask you to ask somebody namedBoylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichmanAt this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest MrBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in thedirection of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblanamoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repairwhereupon he observed evasivelyEverybody gets their own ration of luck they say Now you mention ithis face was familiar to me But leaving that for the moment how much didyou part with he queried if I am not too inquisitiveHalf a crown Stephen responded I daresay he needs it to sleepsomewhereNeeds Mr Bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at theintelligence I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariablydoes Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deedsBut talking about things in general where added he with a smile will yousleep yourself Walking to Sandycove is out of the question And evensupposing you did you wont get in after what occurred at Westland Rowstation Simply fag out there for nothing I dont mean to presume to dictateto you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your fathers houseTo seek misfortune was Stephens answerI met your respected father on a recent occasion Mr Bloomdiplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate onyesterday Where does he live at present I gathered in the course ofconversation that he had movedI believe he is in Dublin somewhere Stephen answered unconcernedlyWhyA gifted man Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior in more respects thanone and a born raconteur if ever there was one He takes great pride quitelegitimate out of you You could go back perhaps he hasarded stillthinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when itwas perfectly evident that the other two Mulligan that is and that Englishtourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion werepatently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to giveStephen the slip in the confusion which they didThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however suchas it was Stephens minds eye being too busily engaged in repicturing hisfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by theingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa thatwas in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink itwith the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten attwo a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy Boody and Katey the catmeanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fishheads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the thirdprecept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it beingquarter tense or if not ember days or something like thatNo Mr Bloom repeated again I wouldnt personally repose much trust inthat boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element DrMulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes Heknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he neverrealised what it is to be without regular meals Of course you didnt noticeas much as I did But it wouldnt occasion me the least surprise to learn thata pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulteriorobjectHe understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was aversatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who wasrapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified badefair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tonymedical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition towhich professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning byartificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries or Malahidewas it was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which hecould not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss tofathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it downto sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simpleExcept it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call pickingyour brains he ventured to throw outThe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented byfriendliness which he gave at Stephens at present morose expression offeatures did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem asto whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or threelowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through theaffair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed mattersto more or less Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more thanconjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed heexperienced no little difficulty in making both ends meetAdjacent to the mens public urinal they perceived an icecream carround which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation weregetting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in aparticularly animated way there being some little differences between thepartiesPuttana madonna che ci dia i quattrini Ho ragione Culo rottoIntendiamoci Mezzo sovrano piu Dice lui peroMezzoFarabutto Mortacci suiMa ascolta Cinque la testa piu Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabmans shelter anunpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if everbeen before the former having previously whispered to the latter a fewhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous SkintheGoatFitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual factswhich quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in A few momentslater saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to begreeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs andstrays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already thereengaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom theyseemingly formed an object of marked curiosityNow touching a cup of coffee Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest tobreak the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape ofsolid food say a roll of some

it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds itThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this teteatete put a boilingswimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and arather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed After which he beata retreat to his counter Mr Bloom determining to have a good square lookat him later on so as not to appear to For which reason he encouragedStephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiouslypushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffeegradually nearer himSounds are impostures Stephen said after a pause of some little time likenames Cicero Podmore Napoleon Mr Goodbody Jesus Mr DoyleShakespeares were as common as Murphies Whats in a nameYes to be sure Mr Bloom unaffectedly

turned to the other occupants of the shelter withthe remarkI seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over hisshoulder The lefthand dead shotThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and hisgestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explainBottles out there say Fifty yards measured Eggs on the bottles Cockshis gun over his shoulder AimsHe

husband D B MurphyThe sailor who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident turned toone of the jarvies with the requestYou dont happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about youThe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a dieof plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object waspassed from hand to handThank you the sailor saidHe deposited the quid in his

that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extentbut he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he hadconsistently remained a landlubber except you call going to

on account of them usingknivesAt this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance isbliss Mr B and Stephen each in his own particular way both instinctivelyexchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nousvariety however towards where SkintheGoat alias the keeper notturning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair Hisinscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itselfbeggaring description conveyed the impression that he didnt understandone jot of what was going on Funny veryThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause One man was reading in fitsand starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with thenatives choza de another the seamans discharge Mr Bloom so far as hewas personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood He vividlyrecollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterdayroughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubleswhen it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in theeighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteenAy boss the sailor broke in Give us back them papersThe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrapeHave you seen the rock of Gibraltar Mr Bloom inquiredThe sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ayor noAh youve touched there too Mr Bloom said Europa point thinking hehad in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but hefailed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust andshook his head with a sort of lazy scornWhat year would that be about Mr B interrogated Can you recall theboatsOur soidisant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily beforeansweringIm tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships Saltjunk all the timeTired seemingly he ceased His questioner perceiving that he was notlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell towoolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globesuffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it coveredfully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant torule the waves On more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near theNorth Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidentlyderelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on thewall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woodsand pastures new as someone somewhere sings And it left him wondering whyPossibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up anddown the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well notexactly under tempting the fates And the odds were twenty to nil there wasreally no secret about it at all Nevertheless without going into theminutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there inall its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had tosail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show howpeople usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow likethe hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically thesame lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was ahighly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter whereliving inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to themlike that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters andcoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid theelements whatever the season when duty called Ireland expects that every manand so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime notforgetting the Irish lights Kish and others liable to capsize at any momentrounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkablychoppy not to say stormy weatherThere was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover the old seadog himselfa rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentlemansvalet at six quid a month Them are his trousers Ive on me and he gave mean oilskin and that jackknife Im game for that job shaving and brushupI hate roaming about Theres my son now Danny run off to sea and hismother got him took in a drapers in Cork where he could be drawing easymoneyWhat age is he queried one hearer who by the way seen from the sidebore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell the townclerk away fromthe carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and astrong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendageWhy the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son DannyHed be about eighteen now way I figure itThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or uncleananyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on whichwas to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to representan anchorThere was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts Imust get a wash tomorrow or next day Its them black lads I objects to Ihate those buggers Suck your blood dry they doesSeeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly draggedhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of themariners hope and rest they had a full view of the figure  and a youngmans sideface looking frowningly ratherTattoo the exhibitor explained That was done when we were Iyingbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow thename of Antonio done that There he is himself a GreekDid it hurt much doing it one asked the sailorThat worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round theSomeway in his Squeezing orSee here he said showing Antonio There he is cursing the mate Andthere he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with hisfingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarnAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonios livid face didactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited theunreserved admiration of everybody including SkintheGoat who thistime stretched overAy ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest Hes gonetoo Ate by sharks after Ay ayHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expressionof beforeNeat bit of work one longshoreman saidAnd whats the number for loafer number two queriedEaten alive a third asked the sailorAy ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time withsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction ofthe questioner about the number Ate A Greek he wasAnd then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering hisalleged endAs bad as old AntonioFor he left me on my ownioThe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black strawhat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring onher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill Mr Bloomscarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the momentflusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheetof the Abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid asidehe picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink Hisreason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door thesame face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormondquay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady inthe brown costume does be with you Mrs B and begged the chance of hiswashing Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not yourwashing Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wifesundergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did tooa mans similar garments initialled with Bewley and Drapers marking inkhers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me lovemy dirty shirt Still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the femalesroom more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keepermade her a rude sign to take herself off Round the side of the EveningTelegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of thedoor with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactlyall there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers roundskipper Murphys nautical chest and then there was no more of herThe gunboat the keeper saidIt beats me Mr Bloom confided to Stephen medically I am speaking howa wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with diseasecan be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if hevalues his health in the least Unfortunate creature Of course I supposesome man is ultimately responsible for her condition Still no matter whatthe cause is from Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merelyremarkingIn this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaringtrade Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soulShe is a bad merchant She buys dear and sells cheapThe elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or aprude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put astop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from anyoldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil w ere notlicensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he couldtruthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from thevery first start Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said andventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybodyconcernedYou as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe inthe soul Or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such asdistinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup I believein that myself because it has been explained by competent men as theconvolutions of the grey matter Otherwise we would never have suchinventions as X rays for instance Do youThus cornered Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memoryto try and concentrate and remember before he could sayThey tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and thereforeincorruptible It would be immortal I understand but for the possibility ofits annihilation by its First Cause Who from all I can hear is quite capableof adding that to the number of His other practical jokes corruptio per seand corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquetteMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though themystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he feltbound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoiningSimple I shouldnt think that is the proper word Of course I grant youto concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moonBut what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to inventthose rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison though I believe it wasbefore his time Galileo was the man I mean and the same applies to thelaws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricitybut its a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existenceof a supernatural GodO that Stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several ofthe bestknown passages in Holy Writ apart from circumstantial evidenceOn this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as theywere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference intheir respective ages clashedHas been the more experienced of the two objected sticking to hisoriginal point with a smile of unbelief Im not so sure about that Thats amatter for everymans opinion and without dragging in the sectarian sideof the business I beg to differ with you in toto there My belief is to tellyou the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them putin by monks most probably or its the big question of our national poet overagain who precisely wrote them like Hamlet and Bacon as you who knowyour Shakespeare infinitely better than I of course I neednt tell you Cantyou drink that coffee by the way Let me stir it And take a piece of thatbun Its like one of our skippers bricks disguised Still noone can givewhat he hasnt got Try a bitCouldnt Stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the momentrefusing to dictate furtherFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well tostir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with somethingapproaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance andlucrative work To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or naydid a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run onteetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and usefullectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders On theother hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wifeMadam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it atone time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying Theidea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profitthere being no competition to speak of Sulphate of copper poison SO orsomething in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheapeatinghouse somewhere but he couldnt remember when it was or whereAnyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him morethan ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr TibblesViCocoa on account of the medical analysis involvedHave a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mugfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle andtook a sip of the offending beverageStill its solid food his good genius urged Im a stickler for solid foodhis one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regularmeals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manualYou ought to eat more solid food You would feel a different manLiquids I can eat Stephen said But O oblige me by taking away thatknife I cant look at the point of it It reminds me of Roman historyMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminatedarticle a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularlyRoman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was theleast conspicuous point about itOur mutual friends stories are like himself Mr Bloom apropos of knivesremarked to his confidante sotto voce Do you think they are genuine Hecould spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old bootsLook at himYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was fullof a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quitewithin the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication thoughat first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he gotoff his chest being strictly accurate gospelHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of himand Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him Thougha wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness therewas something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail deliveryand it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such aweirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity He mighteven have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as peopleoften did about others namely that he killed him himself and had servedhis four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of theAntonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical namewho sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes inthe melodramatic manner above described On the other hand he might beonly bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugsDublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would temptany ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow aboutthe schooner Hesperus and etcetera And when all was said and done thelies a fellow told about himself couldnt probably hold a proverbial candleto the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about himMind you Im not saying that its all a pure invention he resumedAnalogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with Giants thoughthat is rather a far cry you see once in a way Marcella the midget queen Inthose waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs as they arecalled sitting bowlegged they couldnt straighten their legs if you paidthem because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on hiscompanion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call thembehind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so longcramped up being adored as gods Theres an example again of simplesoulsHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventureswho reminded him a bit of Ludwig alias Ledwidge when he occupied theboards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with themanagement in the Flying Dutchman a stupendous success and his host ofadmirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear himthough ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell abit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatibleabout it he conceded On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quitein keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free toadmit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chippotato variety and so forth over in little

Spanish half that is Point of fact she could actually claimSpanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically Spainie Gibraltar She has the Spanish type Quite dark regular brunette blackI for one certainly believe climate accounts for character Thats why Iasked you if you wrote your poetry in ItalianThe temperaments at the door Stephen interposed with were verypassionate about ten shillings Roberto ruba roba suaQuite so Mr Bloom dittoedThen Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknownlistener somewhere we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isoscelestriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san TommasoMastinoIts in the blood Mr Bloom acceded at once All are washed in the bloodof the sun Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it and I was justlooking at those antique statues there The splendid proportions of hipsbosom You simply dont knock against those kind of women here An exceptionhere and there Handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what Imtalking about is the female form Besides they have so little taste in dressmost of them which greatly enhances a womans natural beauty no matterwhat you say Rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine butstill its a thing I simply hate to seeInterest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and thenthe others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog goocollisions with icebergs all that sort of thing Shipahoy of course had hisown say to say He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered amonsoon a kind of wind in the China seas and through all those perils ofthe deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to thateffect a pious medal he had that saved himSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunts rock wreckof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for themoment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbellremembered it Palme on Booterstown strand That was the talk of the townthat year Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times breakers running overher and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified withhorror Then someone said something about the case of the s s LadyCairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack inrather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck No aid was givenHer master the Monas said he was afraid his collision bulkhead wouldgive way She had no water it appears in her holdAt this stage an incident happened It having become necessary forhim to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seatLet me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was justgently dropping off into a peaceful dozeHe made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to thedoor stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter andbore due left While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom whonoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ships rumsticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burninginterior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applyingits nozze to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with agurgling noise The irrepressible Bloom who also had a shrewd suspicionthat the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction inthe shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents andpurposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by hisrum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop linerather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since hislast visit and greatly improved Some person or persons invisible directed himto the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place forthe purpose but

Japs were going to have their little lookin heaffirmed The Boers were the beginning of the end Brummagem Englandwas toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland her Achilles heelwhich he

noIrishman worthy of his salt that served it Then they began to have a fewirascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to thelisteners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as theydidnt indulge in recriminations and come to blowsFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloomwas rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdashfor pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for hewas fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channelunless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealedtheir strength than the opposite It was quite on a par with the quixotic ideain certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of thesister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out tobe how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as ahost of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then itwas highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countrieseven though poles apart Another little interesting point the amours ofwhores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him Irishsoldiers had as often fought for England as against her more so in factAnd now why So the scene between the pair of them the licensee of theplace rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris the famous invincible andthe other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours withthe confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookerona student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the gameAnd as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasnt the other person at allhe B couldnt help feeling and most properly it was better to give peoplelike that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse tohave anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and theirfelonsetting there always being the offchance of a Dannyman comingforward and turning queens evidence or kings now like Denis or PeterCarey an idea he utterly repudiated Quite apart from that he dislikedthose careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle Yet though suchcriminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shapeor form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remainingwhat he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actuallybrandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictionsthough personally he would never be a party to any such thing off thesame bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for herwhen the husband frequently after some words passed between the twoconcerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had thepair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of analternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it juststruck him that Fitz nicknamed Skinthe merely drove the car for the      actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliablyinformed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the pleasome legal luminary saved his skin on In any case that was very ancienthistory by now and as for our friend the pseudo Skintheetcetera he hadtransparently outlived his welcome He ought to have either died naturallyor on the scaffold high Like actresses always farewell positively lastperformance then come up smiling again Generous to a fault of coursetemperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping atthe bone for the shadow So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion thatMr Johnny Lever got rid of some l s d in the course of his perambulations                              round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland taverncome back to Erin and so on Then as for the other he had heard not solong before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply buteffectually silenced the offenderHe took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on thewhole eventempered person declared I let slip He called me a jew and in aheated fashion offensively So I without deviating from plain facts in theleast told him his God I mean Christ was a jew too and all his family likeme though in reality Im not That was one for him A soft answer turnsaway wrath He hadnt a word to say for himself as everyone saw Am I notright He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous darkpride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemedto glean in a kind of a way that it wasnt all exactly Ex quibus Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or foureyes conversing Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any othersecundum carnemOf course Mr B proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides ofthe question It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right andwrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though everycountry they say our own distressful included has the government itdeserves But with a little goodwill all round Its all very fine to boast ofmutual superiority but what about mutual equality I resent violence andintolerance in any shape or form It never reaches anything or stopsanything A revolution must come on the due instalments plan Its a patentabsurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the cornerand speak another vernacular in the next house so to speakMemorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war Stephenassented between Skinners alley and Ormond marketYes Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed entirely endorsing the remark thatwas overwhelmingly right And the whole world was full of that sort ofthingYou just took the words out of my mouth he said A hocuspocus ofconflicting evidence that candidly you couldnt remotely All those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up badblood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kinderroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag werevery largely a question of the money question which was at the back ofeverything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stopThey accuse remarked he audiblyHe turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer toso as the others in case theyJews he softly imparted in an aside in Stephens ear are accused ofruining Not a vestige of truth in it I can safely say History would you besurprised to learn proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisitionhounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell anuncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer forimported them Why Because they are imbued with the proper spirit Theyare practical and are proved to be so I dont want to

compared with goahead America TurksIts in the dogma Because if they didnt believe theyd go straight to heavenwhen they die theyd try to live better at least so I think Thats thejuggle on which the pps raise the wind on false pretences Im he resumedwith dramatic force as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you aboutat the outset and I want to see everyone concluded he all creeds and classespro rata having a comfortable tidysized income in no niggard fashioneither something in the neighbourhood of  pounds per annum Thats thevital issue at stake and its feasible and would be provocative of friendlierintercourse between man and man At least thats my idea for what itsworth I call that patriotism Ubi patria as we learned a smattering of inour classical days in Alma Mater vita bene Where you can live well thesense is if you workOver his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to thissynopsis of things in general Stephen stared at nothing in particular Hecould hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabsabout Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours ofdifferent sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneathor seemed to Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didnt say thewords the voice he heard said if you workCount me out he managed to remark meaning workThe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the personwho owned them pro tem observed or rather his voice speaking did allmust work have to togetherI mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widestpossible sense Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thingWriting for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays Thatswork too Important work After all from the little I know of you after allthe money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourselfand command your price You have every bit as much right to live by yourpen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has What You bothbelong to Ireland the brain and the brawn Each is equally importantYou suspect Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Irelandfor shortI would go a step farther Mr Bloom insinuatedBut I suspect Stephen interrupted that Ireland must be importantbecause it belongs to meWhat belongs queried Mr Bloom bending fancying he was perhapsunder some misapprehension Excuse me Unfortunately I didnt catch thelatter portion What was it you Stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mugof coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding  We cant change the country Let us change the subjectAt this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom to change the subject lookeddown but in a quandary as he couldnt tell exactly what construction to puton belongs to which sounded rather a far cry The rebuke of some kind wasclearer than the other part Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgyspoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his soberstate Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importancehad not been all that was needful or he hadnt been familiarised with theright sort of people With a touch of fear for the young man beside himwhom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris the eyes more especiallyreminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light onthe subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows thatpromised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody toblame but themselves For instance there was the case of OCallaghan forone the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequatemeans with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rottoand making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habitof ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact And thenthe usual denouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after astrong hint to a

forth and so onAll the same Bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at theirmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and notsingly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it wastwenty odd years Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow oftruth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highlyinadvisable all things considered Something evidently riled them in hisdeath Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when hisvarious different political arrangements were nearing completion orwhether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to changehis boots and clothesafter a wetting when a cold resulted and failing toconsult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died ofit

direction ofthe  door and reflected upon the historic story which had arousedextraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse weremade public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them fullof sweet nothings First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened andan attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climaxand the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came asa welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who wereresolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was publicproperty

necessity toproclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that hehad shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when athrill went through the packed court

repeating itself with adifference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alonein his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to thegraveOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatantjokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and thewherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case forthe two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husbandhappened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usualboy Jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in aloving position locked in one anothers arms drawing attention to theirillicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fairone begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees andpromising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if onlythe aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones bebygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her faircheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others Hepersonally being of a sceptical bias believed and didnt make the smallestbones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were alwayshanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was thebest wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake ofargument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded lifeand was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentionson her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred onanother the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married womengetting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famouscases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hiltIt was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance ofbrains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time withprofligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him hislifetime In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take untohimself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladiessociety was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possibledoubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about MissFerguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought himdown to Irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would findmuch satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and thecompany of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweeklywith the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walkingout leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs To think of himhouse and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmotherwas really too bad at his age The queer suddenly things he popped out withattracted the elder man who was several years the others senior or like hisfather but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it onlyan eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that thehomely Humpty Dumpty boiledAt what oclock did you dine he questioned of the slim form and tiredthough unwrinkled faceSome time yesterday Stephen saidYesterday exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrowFriday Ah you mean its after twelveThe day before yesterday Stephen said improving on himselfLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflectedThough they didnt see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy theresomehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the onetrain of thought At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score ofyears previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentaryhonours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect whichwas a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard forthose same ultra ideas For instance when the evicted tenants question thenat its first inception bulked largely in peoples mind though it goeswithout saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely toits dictums some of which wouldnt exactly hold water he at the outset inprinciple at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession asvoicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realisinghis mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twittedwith going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at onetime inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he stronglyresented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friendat the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernans so that he though oftenconsiderably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be itrepeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphoricallyone in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned hewas only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting frompropaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and sufferingit entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chieflydestruction of the fittest in a wordAnyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as itwas it was high time to be retiring for the night The crux was it was a bitrisky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebodyhaving a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as onthe night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lamepaw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he hadhurt his hand too to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly rememberedhaving been there so to speak On the other hand it was altogether far andaway too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he wasin some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives Everything pointed tothe fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunityall things considered His initial impression was he was a shade standoffishor not over effusive but it grew on him someway For one thing he mightntwhat you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried himwas he didnt know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he didentertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure ifhe would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe iffound suitable At all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for thenonce hidebound precedent a cup of Eppss cocoa and a shakedown forthe night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow atleast he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failedto perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso norumpus of any sort was kicked up A move had to be made because thatmerry old soul the grasswidower in question who

seanceSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left theshelter or shanty together and the elite society of oilskin and companywhom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce farniente Stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged outpaused at the for a moment the doorOne thing I never understood he said to be original on the spur of themoment Why they put tables upside down at night I mean chairs upsidedown on the tables in cafesTo which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without amoments hesitation saying straight offTo sweep the floor in the morningSo saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the sametime apologetic to get on his companions right a habit of his by the byehis right side being in classical idiom his tender Achilles The night airwas certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak onhis pinsIt will the air do you good Bloom said meaning also the walk in amoment The only thing is to walk then youll feel a different man ComeIts not far Lean on meAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephens right and led him onaccordinglyYes Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a

all intents and purposeswrapped in the arms of Murphy as the adage has it dreaming of freshfields and pastures new And apropos of coffin of stones the analogy wasnot at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwoout of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split andchiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants hehad put in their holdingsSo they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for whichBloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracksarm in arm across Beresford place Wagnerian music though confessedlygrand in its way was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at thefirst gooff but the music of Mercadantes Huguenots Meyerbeers SevenLast Words on the Cross and Mozarts Twelfth Mass he simply revelled inthe Gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as suchliterally knocking everything else into a cocked hat He infinitely preferredthe sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop couldoffer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to liveand I will live thy protestant to be He also yielded to none in hisadmiration of Rossinis Stabat Mater a work simply abounding inimmortal numbers in which his wife Madam Marion Tweedy made a hit averitable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laureisand putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church inupper Gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hearher with virtuosos or virtuosi rather There was the unanimous opinionthat there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place ofworship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desirefor an encore On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of theDon Giovanni description and Martha a gem in its line he had a penchantthough with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school suchas Mendelssohn And talking of that taking it for granted he knew all aboutthe old favourites he mentioned par excellence Lionels air in MarthaMappari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be moreaccurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips ofStephens respected father sung to perfection a study of the number infact which made all the others take a back seat Stephen in reply to apolitely put query said he didnt sing it but launched out into praises ofShakespeares songs at least of in or about that period the lutenistDowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist who annosludendo hausi Doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasingfrom Mr Arnold Dolmetsch whom B did not quite recall though the namecertainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son withtheir dux and comes conceits and Byrd William who played the virginalshe said in the Queens chapel or anywhere else he found them and oneTomkins who made toys or airs and John BullOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speakingbeyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the pavenground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloomwas not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion tosixtyfive guineas and John Bull He inquired if it was John Bull the politicalcelebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as astriking coincidenceBy the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceivingBloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the otherssleeve gently jocosely remarkingOur lives are in peril tonight Beware of the steamrollerThey thereupon stopped Bloom looked at the head of a horse notworth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quitenear so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even fleshbecause palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker ataildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lordof his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts But such a goodpoor brute he was sorry he hadnt a lump of sugar but as he wiselyreflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that mightcrop up He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse withouta second care in the world But even a dog he reflected take that mongrelin Barney Kiernans of the same size would be a holy horror to face But itwas no animals fault in particular if he was built that way like the camelship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump Nine tenths ofthem all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barringthe bees Whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of hisback and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eyeThese timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mindsomewhat distracted from Stephens words while the ship of the street wasmanoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting oldWhats this I was saying Ah yes My wife he intimated plunging inmedias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making youracquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kindHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephenimage of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsomeblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after ashe was perhaps not that way builtStill supposing he had his fathers gift as he more than suspected itopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingalls Irish industriesconcert on the preceding Monday and aristocracy in generalExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here hasEnd by Jans Pieter Sweelinck a Dutchman of

ListigkeitTun die Poeten dichtenThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore Bloomnodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by allmeans which he didA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boonswhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily ifproperly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such asBarraclough

bestresidential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business andtitled people where with his university degree of B A a huge ad in its wayand gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence

to the better worm his way into their goodgraces as he a youthful tyro insocietys sartorial niceties hardlyunderstood how a little thing like that could militate against you It was infact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participatingin their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of theChristmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of thefair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of whichas he happened to know were on recordin fact without giving the showaway he himself once upon a time if he

lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyricplatform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time But a step in therequired direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily andmentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and itoften turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneededmoment when every little helped Besides though taste latterly haddeteriorated to a degree original music like that different from theconventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decidednovelty for Dublins musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchytenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and HiltonSt Just and their genus omne Yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he couldwith all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a namefor himself and win a high place in the citys esteem where he couldcommand a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for thepatrons of the King street house given a backerup if one were forthcomingto kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some impetus of thegoahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often trippedup a too much feted prince of good fellows And it need not detract fromthe other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of timeto practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doingwithout its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatorywhatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone In fact he had the ball athis feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of aremarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at allThe horse was just then And later on at a propitious opportunity hepurposed Bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on thefools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connectionwith a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparageand even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not presentdeprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in Blooms humbleopinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a persons character no punintendedThe horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak haltedand rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall onthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smokingglobes of turds Slowly three times one after another from a full crupper hemired And humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient inhis scythed carSide by side Bloom

problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutuallyselfexcluding propositionsThe irreparability of the past once at a performance of Albert Henglerscircus in the Rotunda Rutland square Dublin an intuitive particolouredclown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in theauditorium where Bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared toan exhilarated audience that he Bloom was his the clowns papa Theimprevidibility of the future once in the summer of  he Bloom hadmarked a florin  with three notches on the milled edge and tendered itm payment of an account due to

returnedNeverWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress himBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amendmany social conditions the product of inequality and avarice andinternational animosityHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating theseconditionsThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct fromhuman

epicentres of which are located in denselypopulated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions ofmetamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decayWhy did he desist from speculationBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other moreacceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to beremovedDid Stephen participate in his dejectionHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceedingsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rationalreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon

againdivisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends anddivisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progresswere carried far enough nought nowhere was never reachedWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise resultBecause some years previously in  when occupied with the problem ofthe quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a numbercomputed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of somany places eg the th power of the th power of  that the resulthaving been obtained  closely printed

whenelevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere sufferedwith arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line ofdemarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximatedfrom nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposingthis problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesiswhich could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differentlyanatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise underMartian Mercurial Veneral Jovian Saturnian Neptunian or Uraniansufficient and equivalent conditions though

not a heavenbeast not aheavenman That it was a Utopia there being no known method from theknown to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by thesuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and ofdifferent magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in spaceremobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a presentbefore its probable spectators had entered actual present existenceWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacleIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in thedelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejectioninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satelliteof their planetDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of

City Arms hotel when heused to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness tomake himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought hehad a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herselfand her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out d for hermethylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat inher about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bitof fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down onbathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them Isuppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Illnever be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she wasa welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan hereand Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dogsmelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especiallythen still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters andbeggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he gotanything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to gointo a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring itinto him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing onthe carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybelike the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes becausetheyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get wellif his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one offthe south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at thesugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing himflowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basketanything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice tryingto imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face againthough he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bedfather was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut histoe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if itwas a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course thewoman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhereIm sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking ofher so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he wasreally and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning itHynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton andwho else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not longmarried flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my backon him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he hadthe impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almightyand his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called asolicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not thatits some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on thesly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterdayhe was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to showhim Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered itup with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so veryprobably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him becauseall men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he isnow so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool andthen the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two strawsnow who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find outso long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like thatslut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom toexcite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him onceor twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found thelong hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchenpretending he was drinking water  woman is not enough for them it wasall his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat atour table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my housestealing my potatoes and the oysters  per doz going out to see her aunt ifyou please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something onwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have noproof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I toldher what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her Iwouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room theFriday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her faceswelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw tothat better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker onlyfor the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhoweither she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought hewas with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to myface and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she wastoo well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so hemust do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was itthe night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka inmy hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with mythumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming lovebecause he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Imdining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him thesatisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be alwaysand ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to doit since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a littlealone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and makehim turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with thatdown on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hourquestion and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalmanyes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishopwas sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting thatwoollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about themonuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making himworse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking ofwho is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yesimagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of mewhat he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simplyruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it tillhe comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips paleanyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about itpeople make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it andthink no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going andmarrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way sonice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other wouldtake me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothinglike a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hatethat confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me fatherand what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool butwhereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yesrather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottomright out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did youwhatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the realfather what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God hehad a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neitherwould he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know mein the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turnor let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a womanof course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to beembraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like thepope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too carefulabout himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonderwas he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind goingaway so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass amI I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking ofme or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought hesmelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kindof paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip thoserichlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnniesdrink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of thatAmerican that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all hecould do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we tookthe port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovelyand tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I poppedstraight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thoughtthe heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myselfand said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if theworld was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no Godwhat could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only makean act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars streetchapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if heheard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul youhave no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is tohave one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come  or  timeswith that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein orwhatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is notso big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hoursdressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thickcrowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a fewdozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone hadone the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a wholesheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middleof us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they wantout of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut myeyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I madehim pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better incase any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it inme nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but ifsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I wentthrough with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and MinaPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with achild or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell ofchildren off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger witha shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was therea squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear yourears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out likeelephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not offhim though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but Idont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly Isuppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about meand Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do himany good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he wasdancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsonshousewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was onaccount of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had thestandup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lordbeing a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitiveabout everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for Iknew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyedme so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedupthings especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study upthat myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could alwayshear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after thatI pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be abit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I saidover to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and thethree pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him tomake it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her againand was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat theonions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouseor touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I kiss then would sendthem all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she ofcourse would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with himthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love himand look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine hewas and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner likehe did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though Iliked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for theasking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I wasrolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I puthim off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pastyflour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so Ididnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to bealways embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of courseglauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possibleasking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on tothat putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking abit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kindhe is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was veryhandsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked thoughhe was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engagedafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughingwith the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one afteranother with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she saidyes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used totell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough tomake her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the doormuch after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after livingwith that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawnand run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a rowwith him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down aconversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down whatwas it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with hismuddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get intobed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a manwell its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he doesalways wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and alwaysblacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes upin the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for pounds for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like thatsimply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his bootsoff now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die  times overthan marry another of their sex of course hed never find another womanlike me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yesand he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrickthat poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other manyes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do athing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive youmad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marrythem for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get onwithout us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonderwhy they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us aswise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the otherfellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was hernature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang awoman surely are theytheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot henoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B Cwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we bothordered  teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his twoold maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was whatdo I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he mademe buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself alwayswith some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot mysuede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of awoman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladieslavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I sawhis eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was lookingwhen I looked back and I went there for tea  days after in the hope but hewasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when wewere in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk inmy hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month anice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my footso much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwinsbotchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in thehouse to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off mystockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time itwas my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could findbut of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did hesay I could give  points in  to Katty Lanner and beat her what does thatmean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition justpassed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite Ithink I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting thebutter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of whenhe commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods AveMaria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow andpart which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too mylow notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the wayhe used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in aplace like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him aboutthat some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show himthe very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinksnothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about mymother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as hedid he was lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bitcut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth squarehe kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking mequestions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let himkeep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into hispocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seenalways skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirtsblowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at theopen air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun sohe could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind followingin the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner ofthe Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in theZingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat lookingslyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they cango and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it andwere not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you whereare you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes onmy neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting toowarm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes tillI took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves weretoo cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear medrawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pairoff my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he didlook a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made mehungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat Ihad on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneeldown in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his newraincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre sosavage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched histrousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keephim from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out washe circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everythingtoo quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all thetime for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and hadto go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all thosewords in it how could he have the face to any woman after his companymanners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have Ioffended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a fewbrains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking ortearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knewwhat it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand youI said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up witha picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt findanywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morninga letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knewthe way to take a woman when he sent me the  big poppies because minewas the th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn Icouldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but henever knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Mondayas he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answerthe door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you allundressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day oldfrostyface Goodwin called

about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife hewent no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince ofWales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some ofthose books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebodysupposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because herbumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her ae as if anyfool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things withthat old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and thatRuby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I cameto page  o the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cordflagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made upabout he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was overlike the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins armssure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought firstit came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when shewanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was inGibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where heplanted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have plantedme too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought tochuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and gointo an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where theycould put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course heprefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whatsyour programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisementswhen he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did thensending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to bethe manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff asthe mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with theold rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in itbut theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knewit was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd andBums as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale alot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills mealtogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress andcooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I wentby his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take thatthats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he saidsuited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins andneedles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had themisfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be withher smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shesthere for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonderbut he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like thesoup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up toopen the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Imextremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked thefirst time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife Ijust half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he saidIm extremely sorry and Im sure you wereyes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long hemade me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiffthe nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill takethose eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are allthose veins and things curious the way its made  the same in case of twinstheyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in themuseum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they sobeautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bagsfull and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you likea hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgustingCameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with thered head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I waspassing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with hisbabyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well theSurreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every timenearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt streetstation just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was Iof the  wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places thenight coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges andlemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into r of them it was sobiting cold I couldnt keep it when was that  the canal was frozen yes itwas a few months after a

job in Helys and I was sellingthe clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath ofthe nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like thatdirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about likethat I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in itand he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never canexplain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes andburns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so muchtheres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had toscream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milkwith Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could havegot a pound a week as a wet

Ulyssesby James JoyceThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy for Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst and all other Arlingtoniansfor tea sympathy and a sofaFar out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable  end  ofthe  western  spiral  arm  of  the Galaxy lies a small unregardedyellow sunOrbiting this at a distance of roughly ninetytwo  million  milesis  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose apedescended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  stillthink digital watches are a pretty neat ideaThis planet has  or rather had  a problem which was this mostof  the  people  on  it were unhappy for pretty much of the timeMany solutions were suggested for this problem but most of thesewere  largely  concerned with the movements of small green piecesof paper which is odd because on the whole it wasnt  the  smallgreen pieces of paper that were unhappyAnd so the problem remained lots of the people  were  mean  andmost of them were miserable even the ones with digital watchesMany were increasingly of the opinion that theyd all made a  bigmistake  in  coming  down  from the trees in the first place Andsome said that even the trees had been a bad move  and  that  noone should ever have left the oceansAnd then one Thursday nearly two thousand years after  one  manhad  been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to benice to people for a change one girl sitting on  her  own  in  asmall  cafe  in  Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was thathad been going wrong all this time and she finally knew how  theworld  could  be  made  a  good and happy place This time it wasright it would work and no one would  have  to  get  nailed  toanythingSadly however before she could get to a phone  to  tell  anyoneabout  it  a  terribly stupid catastrophe occurred and the ideawas lost foreverThis is not her storyBut it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and  someof its consequencesIt is also the story of a book a book called The  Hitch  HikersGuide  to  the  Galaxy    not  an Earth book never published onEarth and until the terrible catastrophe occurred never seen orheard of by any EarthmanNevertheless a wholly remarkable bookin fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come outof  the  great  publishing  houses  of  Ursa  Minor  of which noEarthman had ever heard eitherNot only is it a wholly remarkable book  it  is  also  a  highlysuccessful  one    more  popular  than  the  Celestial Home CareOmnibus better selling than Fifty More  Things  to  do  in  ZeroGravity and more controversial than Oolon Colluphids trilogy ofphilosophical blockbusters Where God Went  Wrong  Some  More  ofGods Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person AnywayIn many of the more relaxed civilizations on  the  Outer  EasternRim of the Galaxy the Hitch Hikers Guide has already supplantedthe great Encyclopedia Galactica as the  standard  repository  ofall  knowledge  and  wisdom for though it has many omissions andcontains much that is apocryphal or at least wildly  inaccurateit  scores  over the older more pedestrian work in two importantrespectsFirst it is slightly cheaper and  secondly  it  has  the  wordsDont Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its coverBut the story of this terrible stupid Thursday the story of itsextraordinary   consequences   and   the  story   of  how  theseconsequences are inextricably intertwined  with  this  remarkablebook begins very simplyIt begins with a houseThe house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the villageIt  stood  on  its  own  and  looked  over a broad spread of WestCountry farmland Not a remarkable house by any means    it  wasabout  thirty  years old squattish squarish made of brick andhad four windows set in the front of a size and proportion  whichmore or less exactly failed to please the eyeThe only person for whom the house was in  any  way  special  wasArthur  Dent and that was only because it happened to be the onehe lived in He had lived in it for about three years ever sincehe  had  moved  out  of  London  because  it made him nervous andirritable He was about thirty as well  dark  haired  and  neverquite at ease with himself The thing that used to worry him mostwas the fact that people always used  to  ask  him  what  he  waslooking  so  worried  about  He  worked  in local radio which healways used to tell his friends was a lot more  interesting  thanthey  probably  thought It was too  most of his friends workedin advertisingIt hadnt properly registered with Arthur that the council wantedto knock down his house and build an bypass insteadAt eight oclock on Thursday  morning  Arthur  didnt  feel  verygood  He  woke  up blearily got up wandered blearily round hisroom opened a window saw a bulldozer found his  slippers  andstomped off to the bathroom to washToothpaste on the brush  so ScrubShaving mirror  pointing at the ceiling He adjusted it  For  amoment  it  reflected  a  second  bulldozer  through the bathroomwindow Properly adjusted it reflected Arthur  Dents  bristlesHe shaved them off washed dried and stomped off to the kitchento find something pleasant to put in his mouthKettle plug fridge milk coffee YawnThe word bulldozer wandered through his  mind  for  a  moment  insearch of something to connect withThe bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big oneHe stared at itYellow he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom  to  getdressedPassing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of  waterand  another  He began to suspect that he was hung over Why washe hung over Had he been drinking the night before He  supposedthat  he must have been He caught a glint in the shaving mirrorYellow he thought and stomped on to the bedroomHe stood and thought The pub he thought Oh dear the  pub  Hevaguely remembered being angry angry about something that seemedimportant Hed been telling  people  about  it  telling  peopleabout  it  at  great  length  he  rather suspected his clearestvisual recollection was of glazed looks on other peoples  facesSomething  about a new bypass he had just found out about It hadbeen in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have  knownabout  it  Ridiculous  He  took  a swig of water It would sortitself out hed decided no one wanted  a  bypass  the  councildidnt have a leg to stand on It would sort itself outGod what a terrible hangover it had earned him though He  lookedat  himself  in  the  wardrobe  mirror  He stuck out his tongueYellow he thought The word yellow wandered through  his  mindin search of something to connect withFifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in  frontof a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden pathMr L Prosser was as they say only human In other words he  wasa carbonbased life form descended from an ape More specificallyhe was forty fat and shabby and worked for  the  local  councilCuriously  enough though he didnt know it he was also a directmaleline  descendant  of  Genghis   Khan   though   interveninggenerations  and  racial  mixing had so juggled his genes that hehad  no  discernible  Mongoloid  characteristics  and  the  onlyvestiges  left  in  Mr  L  Prosser  of his mighty ancestry were apronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for  littlefur hatsHe was by no means a great warrior in  fact  he  was  a  nervousworried  man  Today  he  was  particularly  nervous  and worriedbecause something had gone seriously wrong with his job    whichwas  to  see  that Arthur Dents house got cleared out of the waybefore the day was outCome off it Mr Dent he said you cant win  you  know  Youcant  lie  in  front of the bulldozer indefinitely He tried tomake his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldnt do itArthur lay in the mud and squelched at himIm game he said well see who rusts firstIm afraid youre going to have to accept it said  Mr  Prossergripping  his  fur  hat and rolling it round the top of his headthis bypass has got to be built and its going to be builtFirst Ive heard of it said Arthur  whys  it  going  to  bebuiltMr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit  then  stopped  andput it away againWhat do you mean whys it got to be built he  said  Its  abypass Youve got to build bypassesBypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from  pointA  to  point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B topoint A very fast People  living  at  point  C  being  a  pointdirectly  in  between  are often given to wonder whats so greatabout point A that so many people of point B are so keen  to  getthere  and  whats so great about point B that so many people ofpoint A are so keen to get there They  often  wish  that  peoplewould  just  once and for all work out where the hell they wantedto beMr Prosser wanted to be at point D Point D  wasnt  anywhere  inparticular it was just any convenient point a very long way frompoints A B and C He would have a nice little cottage  at  pointD  with  axes over the door and spend a pleasant amount of timeat point E which would be the nearest pub to point D  His  wifeof  course  wanted  climbing roses but he wanted axes He didntknow why  he  just  liked  axes  He  flushed  hotly  under  thederisive grins of the bulldozer driversHe shifted his weight from foot  to  foot  but  it  was  equallyuncomfortable  on  each  Obviously somebody had been appallinglyincompetent and he hoped to God it wasnt himMr Prosser said You were quite entitled to make any suggestionsor protests at the appropriate time you knowAppropriate time hooted Arthur Appropriate time The first Iknew  about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday Iasked him if hed come to clean the windows and he said  no  hedcome  to  demolish  the house He didnt tell me straight away ofcourse Oh no First he wiped a couple of windows and charged  mea fiver Then he told meBut Mr Dent the plans have been available in the local planningoffice for the last nine monthOh yes well as soon as I heard I went  straight  round  to  seethem  yesterday  afternoon  You hadnt exactly gone out of yourway to call attention to them  had  you  I  mean  like  actuallytelling anybody or anythingBut the plans were on display On display I eventually had to go down to the  cellar  to  findthemThats the display departmentWith a torchAh well the lights had probably goneSo had the stairsBut look you found the notice didnt youYes said Arthur yes I did It was on display in  the  bottomof  a  locked  filing  cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with asign on the door saying Beware of the LeopardA cloud passed overhead It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as  helay  propped  up  on  his elbow in the cold mud It cast a shadowover Arthur Dents house Mr Prosser frowned at itIts not as if its a particularly nice house he saidIm sorry but I happen to like itYoull like the bypassOh shut up said Arthur Dent Shut up and go  away  and  takeyour  bloody  bypass  with you You havent got a leg to stand onand you know itMr Prossers mouth opened and closed a couple of times while  hismind  was  for  a  moment  filled  with inexplicable but terriblyattractive visions of Arthur Dents  house  being  consumed  withfire  and  Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruinwith at least three hefty spears protruding  from  his  back  MrProsser  was often bothered with visions like these and they madehim feel very nervous He stuttered for a moment and then  pulledhimself togetherMr Dent he saidHello Yes said ArthurSome factual information for you Have you  any  idea  how  muchdamage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straightover youHow much said ArthurNone at  all  said  Mr  Prosser  and  stormed  nervously  offwondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemenall shouting at himBy a curious  coincidence  None  at  all  is  exactly  how  muchsuspicion  the  apedescendant  Arthur  Dent  had that one of hisclosest friends was not descended from an ape but  was  in  factfrom  a  small  planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not fromGuildford as he usually claimedArthur Dent had never ever suspected thisThis friend of his had first arrived on the planet  some  fifteenEarth  years  previously and he had worked hard to blend himselfinto Earth society  with it must be  said  some  success  Forinstance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an outof work actor which was plausible enoughHe had made one careless blunder though because he had skimped abit  on his preparatory research The information he had gatheredhad led him to choose the name Ford  Prefect  as  being  nicelyinconspicuousHe was not conspicuously tall his features were striking but notconspicuously  handsome  His  hair  was  wiry  and gingerish andbrushed backwards from the temples His skin seemed to be  pulledbackwards  from  the  nose There was something very slightly oddabout him but it was difficult to say what it  was  Perhaps  itwas  that  his eyes didnt blink often enough and when you talkedto him for any length of time your eyes  began  involuntarily  towater  on  his behalf Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly toobroadly and gave people the  unnerving  impression  that  he  wasabout to go for their neckHe struck most of  the  friends  he  had  made  on  Earth  as  aneccentric  but  a  harmless  one    an unruly boozer with someoddish habits For instance he would often  gatecrash  universityparties   get   badly   drunk   and  start  making  fun  of  anyastrophysicist he could find till he got thrown outSometimes he would get seized with  oddly  distracted  moods  andstare  into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him whathe was doing Then he would start guiltily for  a  moment  relaxand grinOh just looking for flying saucers he would joke and everyonewould  laugh  and  ask  him  what  sort  of flying saucers he waslooking forGreen ones he would reply with a wicked grin laugh wildly fora  moment  and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy anenormous round of drinksEvenings like this usually ended badly Ford would get out of hisskull  on whisky huddle into a corner with some girl and explainto her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the  flyingsaucers didnt matter that much reallyThereafter staggering semiparalytic down the night  streets  hewould  often  ask  passing  policemen  if  they  knew  the way toBetelgeuse The  policemen  would  usually  say  something  likeDont you think its about time you went off home sirIm trying to baby Im trying  to  is  what  Ford  invariablyreplied on these occasionsIn fact what he  was  really  looking  out  for  when  he  stareddistractedly  into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer atall The reason he said green was that green was the  traditionalspace livery of the Betelgeuse trading scoutsFord Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer  at  all  wouldarrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get strandedanywhere particularly somewhere as  mindboggingly  dull  as  theEarthFord wished that a flying saucer would  arrive  soon  because  heknew  how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them Heknew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than  thirtyAltairan dollars a dayIn fact Ford Prefect was a roving  researcher  for  that  whollyremarkable book The Hitch Hikers Guide to the GalaxyHuman beings are great adaptors and by  lunchtime  life  in  theenvirons  of Arthurs house had settled into a steady routine Itwas Arthurs accepted role to lie squelching in  the  mud  makingoccasional  demands to see his lawyer his mother or a good bookit was Mr Prossers accepted  role  to  tackle  Arthur  with  theoccasional  new  ploy  such  as the For the Public Good talk theMarch of Progress talk the They Knocked My House Down  Once  YouKnow  Never  Looked  Back  talk and various other cajoleries andthreats and it was the bulldozer drivers accepted role  to  sitaround  drinking  coffee and experimenting with union regulationsto see how they could  turn  the  situation  to  their  financialadvantageThe Earth moved slowly in its diurnal courseThe sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay inA shadow moved across him againHello Arthur said the shadowArthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled  to  seeFord Prefect standing above himFord Hello how are youFine said Ford look are you busyAm I busy exclaimed Arthur Well Ive  just  got  all  thesebulldozers and things to lie in front of because theyll knock myhouse down if I dont but other  than  that    well  no  notespecially whyThey dont have sarcasm on Betelgeuse  and  Ford  Prefect  oftenfailed  to notice it unless he was concentrating He said Goodis there anywhere we can talkWhat said Arthur DentFor a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him and  stared  fixedlyinto  the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car Thensuddenly he squatted down beside ArthurWeve got to talk he said urgentlyFine said Arthur talkAnd drink said Ford Its vitally important that we talk  anddrink Now Well go to the pub in the villageHe looked into the sky again nervous expectantLook dont you  understand  shouted  Arthur  He  pointed  atProsser That man wants to knock my house downFord glanced at him puzzledWell he can do it while youre away cant he he askedBut I dont want him toAhLook whats the matter with you Ford said ArthurNothing Nothings the matter Listen to me  Ive got  to  tellyou  the most important thing youve ever heard Ive got to tellyou now and Ive got to tell you in the saloon bar of the  Horseand GroomBut whyBecause you are going to need a very stiff drinkFord stared at Arthur and Arthur was astonished to find that hiswill  was  beginning  to  weaken He didnt realize that this wasbecause of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in  thehyperspace  ports  that  served the madranite mining belts in thestar system of Orion BetaThe game was not unlike the Earth game called  Indian  Wrestlingand was played like thisTwo contestants would sit either side of a table with a glass infront of each of themBetween them  would  be  placed  a  bottle  of  Janx  Spirit  asimmortalized  in that ancient Orion mining song Oh dont give menone more of that Old Janx Spirit No dont  you  give  me  nonemore  of  that  Old  Janx Spirit For my head will fly my tonguewill lie my eyes will fry and I may die Wont you pour  me  onemore of that sinful Old Janx SpiritEach of the two contestants would then concentrate their will  onthe  bottle  and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glassof his opponent  who would then have to drink itThe bottle would then be  refilled  The  game  would  be  playedagain And againOnce you started to lose you would probably keep losing  becauseone  of  the  effects  of  Janx  spirit is to depress telepsychicpowerAs soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed the  finalloser  would  have  to  perform  a  forfeit  which  was  usuallyobscenely biologicalFord Prefect usually played to loseFord stared at Arthur who began to think  that  perhaps  he  didwant to go to the Horse and Groom after allBut what about my house  he asked plaintivelyFord looked across to Mr Prosser and suddenly a  wicked  thoughtstruck himHe wants to knock your house downYes he wants to build And he cant because youre lying in front of the bulldozersYes and Im sure we can come to some arrangement  said  Ford  Excuseme he shoutedMr Prosser who was arguing with a spokesman  for  the  bulldozerdrivers  about  whether  or  not Arthur Dent constituted a mentalhealth hazard and how much they  should  get  paid  if  he  didlooked around He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find thatArthur had companyYes Hello he called Has Mr Dent come to his senses yetCan we for the moment called Ford assume that he hasntWell sighed Mr ProsserAnd can we also assume said  Ford  that  hes  going  to  bestaying here all daySoSo all your men are going to be standing around  all  day  doingnothingCould be could be Well if  youre  resigned  to  doing  that  anyway  you  dontactually need him to lie here all the time do youWhatYou dont said Ford patiently actually need him hereMr Prosser thought about thisWell no not as  such  he  said  not  exactly  need  Prosser  was worried He thought that one of them wasnt making alot of senseFord said So if you would just like to take  it  as  read  thathes  actually here then he and I could slip off down to the pubfor half an hour How does that soundMr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly pottyThat sounds perfectly reasonable he said in a reassuring  toneof voice wondering who he was trying to reassureAnd if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself  later  onsaid Ford we can always cover up for you in returnThank you very much said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how  toplay  this  at  all  thank you very much yes thats very kind He frowned then smiled then tried  to  do  both  at  oncefailed  grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully roundthe top of his head He could only assume that he had just wonSo continued Ford Prefect if you would  just  like  to  comeover here and lie down What said Mr ProsserAh Im sorry said Ford perhaps I hadnt made  myself  fullyclear  Somebodys  got to lie in front of the bulldozers haventthey Or there wont be anything to stop  them  driving  into  MrDents house will thereWhat said Mr Prosser againIts very simple said Ford my client Mr Dent says that  hewill  stop  lying  here in the mud on the sole condition that youcome and take over from himWhat are you talking about said Arthur but  Ford  nudged  himwith his shoe to be quietYou want me said Mr Prosser spelling out this new thought  tohimself to come and lie there YesIn front of the bulldozerYesInstead of Mr DentYesIn the mudIn as you say it the mudAs soon as Mr Prosser realized  that  he  was  substantially  theloser  after  all  it  was  as if a weight lifted itself off hisshoulders this was more like the world as he knew it He sighedIn return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down  to  thepubThats it said Ford Thats it exactlyMr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stoppedPromisePromise said Ford He turned to ArthurCome on he said to him get up and let the man lie downArthur stood up feeling as if he was in a dreamFord beckoned to Prosser who sadly awkwardly sat  down  in  themud  He  felt  that his whole life was some kind of dream and hesometimes wondered whose it was and whether  they  were  enjoyingit The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozedinto his shoesFord looked at him severelyAnd no sneaky knocking down Mr Dents house  whilst  hes  awayalright he saidThe mere thought growled Mr Prosser  hadnt  even  begun  tospeculate  he  continued  settling  himself  back  about themerest possibility of crossing my mindHe saw the bulldozer drivers  union  representative  approachingand  let his head sink back and closed his eyes He was trying tomarshal his arguments for proving that he did not now  constitutea  mental  health  hazard  himself He was far from certain aboutthis  his mind seemed to be full of noise  horses  smoke  andthe  stench of blood This always happened when he felt miserableand put upon and he  had  never  been  able  to  explain  it  tohimself  In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mightyKhan bellowed with rage but Mr Prosser  only  trembled  slightlyand whimpered He began to fell little pricks of water behind theeyelids Bureaucratic cockups  angry  men  lying  in  the  mudindecipherable  strangers  handing  out inexplicable humiliationsand an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his  head what a dayWhat a day Ford Prefect knew that it didnt  matter  a  pair  ofdingos  kidneys  whether  Arthurs house got knocked down or notnowArthur remained very worriedBut can we trust him he saidMyself Id trust him to the end of the Earth said FordOh yes said Arthur and how fars thatAbout twelve minutes away  said  Ford  come  on  I  need  adrinkHeres what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about  alcoholIt  says  that  alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed bythe fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effecton certain carbonbased life formsThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy also mentions  alcohol  Itsays  that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic GargleBlasterIt says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is  likehaving  your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped rounda large gold brickThe Guide also tells you on which planets the best  Pan

Groom And quickly please the worlds about to endThe barman of the Horse and Groom didnt  deserve  this  sort  oftreatment  he  was a dignified old man He pushed his glasses uphis nose and blinked at Ford Prefect Ford ignored him and staredout  of  the  window  so the barman looked instead at Arthur whoshrugged helplessly and said nothingSo the barman said Oh  yes  sir  Nice  weather  for  it  andstarted pulling pintsHe tried againGoing to watch the match this afternoon thenFord glanced round at himNo no point he said and looked back out of the windowWhats that foregone conclusion then you reckon sir said  thebarman Arsenal without a chanceNo no said Ford its just that the worlds about to endOh yes sir so you said said  the  barman  looking  over  hisglasses  this  time  at  Arthur  Lucky escape for Arsenal if itdidFord looked back at him genuinely surprisedNo not really he said He frownedThe barman breathed in heavily There you are sir  six  pintshe saidArthur smiled at him wanly and  shrugged  again  He  turned  andsmiled  wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them hadheard what was going onNone of them had and none of them could understand what  he  wassmiling at them forA man sitting next to Ford at the bar  looked  at  the  two  menlooked  at the six pints did a swift burst of mental arithmeticarrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid  hopeful  grinat themGet off said Ford Theyre ours  giving  him  a  look  thatwould have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doingFord slapped a fivepound note on the bar  He  said  Keep  thechangeWhat from a fiver Thank you sirYouve got ten minutes left to spend itThe barman simply decided to walk away for a bitFord said Arthur would you please tell me what the  hell  isgoing onDrink up said Ford youve got three pints to get throughThree pints said Arthur At lunchtimeThe man next to ford grinned and  nodded  happily  Ford  ignoredhim He said Time is an illusion Lunchtime doubly soVery deep said  Arthur  you  should  send  that  in  to  theReaders Digest Theyve got a page for people like youDrink upWhy three pints all of a suddenMuscle relaxant youll need itMuscle relaxantMuscle relaxantArthur stared into his beerDid I do anything wrong today  he  said  or  has  the  worldalways  been  like this and Ive been too wrapped up in myself tonoticeAlright said Ford Ill try to  explain  How  long  have  weknown each otherHow long Arthur thought Er about five years maybe six hesaid Most of it seemed to make some sense at the timeAlright said Ford How would you react if I said that Im notfrom  Guildford  after  all but from a small planet somewhere inthe vicinity of BetelgeuseArthur shrugged in a soso sort of wayI dont know he said taking a pull of beer  Why    do  youthink its the sort of thing youre likely to sayFord gave up It really wasnt worth  bothering  at  the  momentwhat with the world being about to end He just saidDrink upHe added perfectly factuallyThe worlds about to endArthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile  The  rest  ofthe  pub  frowned  at  him A man waved at him to stop smiling atthem and mind his own businessThis must be Thursday said Arthur musing to  himself  sinkinglow over his beer I never could get the hang of ThursdaysOn this particular Thursday something was moving quietly throughthe  ionosphere  many  miles  above  the  surface  of the planetseveral somethings in fact  several  dozen  huge  yellow  chunkyslablike  somethings  huge as office buildings silent as birdsThey soared with ease basking in electromagnetic rays  from  thestar Sol biding their time grouping preparingThe planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious  of  theirpresence  which  was just how they wanted it for the moment Thehuge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly  they  passedover  Cape  Canaveral  without  a  blip Woomera and Jodrell Banklooked straight through them  which was a pity  because  it  wasexactly  the  sort  of  thing  theyd  been looking for all theseyearsThe only place they registered at all was on a small black devicecalled  a  SubEtha  SensOMatic  which  winked  away quietly toitself It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel whichFord Prefect wore habitually round his neck The contents of FordPrefects satchel were quite interesting in fact and  would  havemade any Earth physicists eyes pop out of his head which is whyhe always concealed them by keeping a couple of dogeared scriptsfor plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the topBesides the SubEtha SensOMatic  and  the  scripts  he  had  anElectronic  Thumb  a short squat black rod smooth and matt witha couple of flat switches and dials at one end  he  also  had  adevice  which looked rather like a largish electronic calculatorThis had about a hundred tiny flat press  buttons  and  a  screenabout  four  inches  square on which any one of a million pagescould be summoned  at  a  moments  notice  It  looked  insanelycomplicated and this was one of the reasons why the snug plasticcover it fitted into had the words Dont Panic printed on  it  inlarge friendly letters The other reason was that this device wasin fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of thegreat  publishing  corporations of Ursa Minor  The Hitch HikersGuide to the Galaxy The reason why it was published in the  formof  a  micro  sub  meson  electronic component is that if it wereprinted in normal book form an interstellar  hitch  hiker  wouldrequire several inconveniently large buildings to carry it aroundinBeneath that in Ford  Prefects  satchel  were  a  few  biros  anotepad and a largish bath towel from Marks and SpencerThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say  onthe subject of towelsA towel it says is about the most  massively  useful  thing  aninterstellar  hitch hiker can have Partly it has great practicalvalue  you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound acrossthe cold moons of Jaglan Beta you can lie on it on the brilliantmarblesanded beaches of Santraginus V inhaling  the  heady  seavapours  you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine soredly on the desert world of Kakrafoon use it  to  sail  a  miniraft  down  the slow heavy river Moth wet it for use in handtohandcombat wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes orto  avoid  the  gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal amindboggingly stupid animal it assumes that if you cant see itit  cant  see  you  daft as a bush but very ravenous you canwave your towel in emergencies  as  a  distress  signal  and  ofcourse  dry  yourself  off  with it if it still seems to be cleanenoughMore importantly a towel has immense  psychological  value  Forsome reason if a strag strag nonhitch hiker discovers that ahitch hiker has his towel with him he will automatically  assumethat  he  is  also  in  possession of a toothbrush face flannelsoap tin of biscuits flask compass map ball of string  gnatspray  wet  weather gear space suit etc etc Furthermore thestrag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of  these  or  adozen  other  items  that the hitch hiker might accidentally havelost What the strag will think is that any man who  can  hitchthe length and breadth of the galaxy rough it slum it struggleagainst terrible odds win through and  still  knows  where  histowel is is clearly a man to be reckoned withHence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking  slang  as  inHey  you  sass  that  hoopy  Ford  Prefect Theres a frood whoreally knows where his towel is Sass know be aware of meethave   sex  with  hoopy  really  together  guy  frood  reallyamazingly together guyNestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford  Prefects  satchelthe SubEtha SensOMatic began to wink more quickly Miles abovethe surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fanout  At  Jodrell  Bank  someone  decided it was time for a nicerelaxing cup of teaYou got a towel with you said Ford Prefect suddenly to ArthurArthur struggling through his third pint looked round at himWhy What no    should  I  have  He  had  given  up  beingsurprised there didnt seem to be any point any longerFord clicked his tongue in irritationDrink up he urgedAt that moment the dull sound of a rumbling  crash  from  outsidefiltered  through the low murmur of the pub through the sound ofthe jukebox through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccuppingover the whisky Ford had eventually bought himArthur choked on his beer leapt to his feetWhats that he yelpedDont worry said Ford they havent started yetThank God for that said Arthur and relaxedIts probably just your house being knocked  down  said  Forddrowning his last pintWhat shouted Arthur Suddenly Fords spell was broken  Arthurlooked wildly around him and ran to the windowMy God they are Theyre knocking my house down What  the  hellam I doing in the pub FordIt hardly makes any difference at this stage said  Ford  letthem have their funFun yelped Arthur Fun He quickly checked out of the windowagain that they were talking about the same thingDamn their fun he hooted and ran  out  of  the  pub  furiouslywaving  a  nearly  empty beer glass He made no friends at all inthe pub that lunchtimeStop you vandals You home wreckers bawled Arthur You  halfcrazed Visigoths stop will youFord would have to go after him Turning quickly to the barman heasked for four packets of peanutsThere you are sir said the barman slapping the packets on thebar twentyeight pence if youd be so kindFord was very kind  he gave the barman another  fivepound  noteand told him to keep the change The barman looked at it and thenlooked at Ford He suddenly shivered he experienced a  momentarysensation  that  he didnt understand because no one on Earth hadever experienced it before In moments  of  great  stress  everylife  form  that  exists  gives  out a tiny sublimal signal Thissignal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense  ofhow far that being is from the place of his birth On Earth it isnever possible to be further than  sixteen  thousand  miles  fromyour birthplace which really isnt very far so such signals aretoo minute to be noticed Ford Prefect was at this  moment  undergreat  stress  and  he was born  light years away in the nearvicinity of BetelgeuseThe  barman  reeled  for   a   moment   hit   by   a   shockingincomprehensible sense of distance He didnt know what it meantbut he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect almostaweAre you serious sir he said in a small whisper which had  theeffect  of  silencing  the  pub  You think the worlds going toendYes said FordBut this afternoonFord had recovered himself He was at his flippestYes  he  said  gaily  in  less  than  two  minutes  I  wouldestimateThe barman couldnt believe the conversation he was  having  buthe couldnt believe the sensation he had just had eitherIsnt there anything we can do about it then he saidNo nothing said Ford stuffing the peanuts into his pocketsSomeone in the hushed  bar  suddenly  laughed  raucously  at  howstupid everyone had becomeThe man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now  His  eyeswaved their way up to FordI thought he said that if the world was going to end we weremeant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or somethingIf you like yes said FordThats what they told us in the army said  the  man  and  hiseyes began the long trek back down to his whiskyWill that help asked the barmanNo said Ford and gave him a friendly smile  Excuse  me  hesaid Ive got to go With a wave he leftThe pub was silent for a moment longer and then  embarrassinglyenough  the man with the raucous laugh did it again The girl hehad dragged along to the pub with him had  grown  to  loathe  himdearly  over the last hour or so and it would probably have beena great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and  a  halfor so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen ozoneand carbon monoxide However when the moment came she  would  betoo busy evaporating herself to notice itThe barman cleared his throat He heard himself sayLast orders pleaseThe huge yellow machines began  to  sink  downward  and  to  movefasterFord knew they were there This wasnt the way he had wanted itRunning up the lane Arthur had  nearly  reached  his  house  Hedidnt  notice  how cold it had suddenly become he didnt noticethe wind he didnt notice the sudden irrational squall of  rainHe didnt notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawlingover the rubble that had been his homeYou barbarians he yelled Ill  sue  the  council  for  everypenny  its  got  Ill  have  you hung drawn and quartered Andwhipped And boiled  until   until    until  youve  hadenoughFord was running after him very fast Very very fastAnd then Ill do  it  again  yelled  Arthur  And  when  Ivefinished  I  will  take  all  the little bits and I will jump onthemArthur  didnt  notice  that  the  men  were  running  from   thebulldozers   he  didnt  notice  that  Mr  Prosser  was  staringhectically into the sky What Mr Prosser  had  noticed  was  thathuge   yellow  somethings  were  screaming  through  the  cloudsImpossibly huge yellow somethingsAnd I will carry on  jumping  on  them  yelled  Arthur  stillrunning  until  I get blisters or I can think of anything evenmore unpleasant to do and then Arthur tripped and fell headlong rolled and landed flat on  hisback  At last he noticed that something was going on His fingershot upwardsWhat the hells that he shriekedWhatever it was raced across the  sky  in  monstrous  yellownesstore  the  sky apart with mindbuggering noise and leapt off intothe distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bangthat drove your ears six feet into your skullAnother one followed and did the same thing only louderIts difficult to say exactly what the people on the  surface  ofthe  planet  were doing now because they didnt really know whatthey were doing themselves None of it made  a  lot  of  sense  running  into  houses running out of houses howling noiselesslyat the noise All around the world  city  streets  exploded  withpeople cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them andthen rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys desertsand oceans seeming to flatten everything it hitOnly one man stood and  watched  the  sky  stood  with  terriblesadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears He knew exactlywhat was happening and had known ever since his SubEtha  SensOMatic  had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillarand woken him with a start It was what he  had  waited  for  allthese  years  but  when  he  had  deciphered  the signal patternsitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had  gripped  himand squeezed his heart Of all the races in all of the Galaxy whocould have come and said a big hello to planet Earth he thoughtdidnt it just have to be the VogonsStill he knew what he had to do  As  the  Vogon  craft  screamedthrough  the  air  high above him he opened his satchel He threwaway a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor  Dreamcoat  hethrew away a copy of Godspell He wouldnt need them where he wasgoing Everything was ready everything was preparedHe knew where his towel wasA sudden silence hit the Earth If anything it was worse than thenoise For a while nothing happenedThe great ships hung motionless in the air over every nation  onEarth  Motionless  they  hung huge heavy steady in the sky ablasphemy against nature Many people went straight into shock astheir  minds  tried  to  encompass what they were looking at Theships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks dontAnd still nothing happenedThen there was a slight whisper a  sudden  spacious  whisper  ofopen  ambient  sound  Every hi fi set in the world every radioevery television every cassette recorder  every  woofer  everytweeter  every  midrange  driver  in  the  world quietly turneditself onEvery tin can every dust bin every  window  every  car  everywine  glass  every  sheet  of rusty metal became activated as anacoustically perfect sounding boardBefore the Earth passed away it was going to be  treated  to  thevery  ultimate in sound reproduction the greatest public addresssystem ever built  But  there  was  no  concert  no  music  nofanfare just a simple messagePeople of Earth your attention please a voice  said  and  itwas   wonderful   Wonderful   perfect  quadrophonic  sound  withdistortion levels so low as to make a brave man weepThis is  Prostetnic  Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic  HyperspacePlanning  Council the voice continued As you will no doubt beaware the plans for development of the outlying regions  of  theGalaxy  require  the  building  of  a  hyperspatial express routethrough your star system and regrettably your planet is  one  ofthose  scheduled  for  demolition The process will take slightlyless that two of your Earth minutes Thank youThe PA died awayUncomprehending terror settled on the watching people  of  EarthThe  terror  moved  slowly through the gathered crowds as if theywere iron fillings on a sheet of board and a  magnet  was  movingbeneath  them Panic sprouted again desperate fleeing panic butthere was nowhere to flee toObserving this the Vogons turned on their PA again It saidTheres no point in acting  all  surprised  about  it  All  theplanning  charts  and  demolition  orders have been on display inyour local planning department on Alpha  Centauri  for  fifty  ofyour  Earth  years  so  youve  had  plenty of time to lodge anyformal complaint and its far too late to  start  making  a  fussabout it nowThe PA fell silent again and its  echo  drifted  off  across  theland The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power Onthe underside of each a hatchway opened an empty black spaceBy  this  time  somebody  somewhere  must  have  manned  a  radiotransmitter  located a wavelength and broadcasted a message backto the Vogon ships to plead on behalf of the planet Nobody everheard  what  they said they only heard the reply The PA slammedback into life again The voice was annoyed It saidWhat do you mean  youve  never  been  to  Alpha  Centauri  Forheavens  sake mankind its only four light years away you knowIm sorry but if you cant be bothered to take  an  interest  inlocal affairs thats your own lookoutEnergize the demolition beamsLight poured out into the hatchwaysI dont know said the  voice  on  the  PA  apathetic  bloodyplanet Ive no sympathy at all It cut offThere was a terrible ghastly silenceThere was a terrible ghastly noiseThere was a terrible ghastly silenceThe Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away  into  the  inky  starryvoidFar away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy  five  hundredthousand  light  years  from  the  star  Sol  Zaphod BeeblebroxPresident of the Imperial Galactic Government  sped  across  theseas  of  Damogran his ion drive delta boat winking and flashingin the Damogran sunDamogran the  hot  Damogran  the  remote  Damogran  the  almosttotally unheard ofDamogran secret home of the Heart of GoldThe boat sped on across the water It would be some  time  beforeit   reached   its   destination  because  Damogran  is  such  aninconveniently  arranged  planet  It  consists  of  nothing  butmiddling  to  large  desert  islands separated by very pretty butannoyingly wide stretches of oceanThe boat sped onBecause of  this  topological  awkwardness  Damogran  has  alwaysremained  a  deserted  planet  This is why the Imperial GalacticGovernment chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project  becauseit was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secretThe boat zipped and skipped across the  sea  the  sea  that  laybetween  the  main  islands of the only archipelago of any usefulsize on the whole planet Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his  way  fromthe  tiny  spaceport  on  Easter Island the name was an entirelymeaningless coincidence  in Galacticspeke  easter  means  smallflat  and  light  brown  to  the  Heart of Gold island which byanother meaningless coincidence was called FranceOne of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a  wholestring of pretty meaningless coincidencesBut it was not in any way a coincidence that today  the  day  ofculmination  of  the project the great day of unveiling the daythat the Heart  of  Gold  was  finally  to  be  introduced  to  amarvelling Galaxy was also a great day of culmination for ZaphodBeeblebrox It was for the sake of this day  that  he  had  firstdecided  to  run  for  the  Presidency a decision which had sentwaves of astonishment throughout the  Imperial  Galaxy    ZaphodBeeblebrox   President  Not  the  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  Not  thePresident Many had seen it as a clinching proof that  the  wholeof known creation had finally gone bananasZaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speedZaphod Beeblebrox  adventurer  exhippy  good  timer  crookquite  possibly  manic selfpublicist terribly bad at personalrelationships often thought to be completely out to lunchPresidentNo one had gone bananas not in that way at leastOnly six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle  onwhich  the  Galaxy  was  governed and they knew that once ZaphodBeeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it wasmore  or  less  a  fait  accompli  he  was  the ideal PresidencyfodderWhat they completely failed to  understand  was  why  Zaphod  wasdoing itHe banked sharply shooting a wild wall of water at the sunToday was the day today was the day when they would realize whatZaphod  had  been  up  to  Today  was  what  Zaphod BeeblebroxsPresidency was all  about  Today  was  also  his  two  hundredthbirthday but that was just another meaningless coincidenceAs he skipped his boat across the  seas  of  Damogran  he  smiledquietly  to  himself  about  what a wonderful exciting day it wasgoing to be He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across theseat back He steered with an extra arm hed recently fitted justbeneath his right one to help improve his skiboxingHey he cooed to himself youre a real cool boy you But hisnerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistleThe island of France was about  twenty  miles  long  five  milesacross  the  middle sandy and crescent shaped In fact it seemedto exist not so much as an island in its own right  as  simply  ameans  of  defining  the  sweep  and  curve  of  a huge bay Thisimpression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline ofthe  crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs From thetop of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five  miles  to  theopposite shoreOn top of the cliffs stood a reception committeeIt consisted in large part of the engineers and  researchers  whohad built the Heart of Gold  mostly humanoid but here and therewere a few reptiloid atomineers two or  three  green  slyphlikemaximegalacticans  an  octopoid  physucturalist  or  two  and  aHooloovoo a Hooloovoo is a superintelligent shade of the  colorblue  All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multicolored ceremonial lab coats the Hooloovoo had been  temporarilyrefracted into a free standing prism for the occasionThere was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through  all  ofthem  Together  and between them they had gone to and beyond thefurthest limits of physical laws  restructured  the  fundamentalfabric  of  matter  strained  twisted  and  broken  the laws ofpossibility and impossibility but still the greatest  excitementof  all  seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round hisneck An orange sash  was  what  the  President  of  the  Galaxytraditionally  wore It might not even have made much differenceto them if theyd known exactly how much power the  President  ofthe  Galaxy actually wielded none at all Only six people in theGalaxy knew that the job of the Galactic  President  was  not  towield power but to attract attention away from itZaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his jobThe  crowd  gasped  dazzled  by  sun  and  seemanship  as   thePresidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay Itflashed and shone as  it  came  skating  over  the  sea  in  wideskidding turnsIn fact it didnt need to touch the water at all because it  wassupported  on  a  hazy  cushion  of  ionized atoms  but just foreffect it was fitted with thin finblades which could  be  loweredinto  the  water  They  slashed sheets of water hissing into theair carved deep gashes into the sea  which  swayed  crazily  andsank  back foaming into the boats wake as it careered across thebayZaphod loved effect it was what he was best atHe twisted the wheel sharply the boat slewed  round  in  a  wildscything  skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightlyon the rocking wavesWithin seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned  atover  three  billion  people  The  three  billion people werentactually there but they watched his every  gesture  through  theeyes  of a small robot triD camera which hovered obsequiously inthe air nearby The antics of the President always made amazinglypopular triD thats what they were forHe grinned again Three billion and six people  didnt  know  itbut today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained forThe robot camera homed in for a close up on the more  popular  ofhis  two  heads  and  he  waved again He was roughly humanoid inappearance except for the extra head  and  third  arm  His  fairtousled  hair  stuck  out  in  random  directions  his blue eyesglinted with something completely unidentifiable and  his  chinswere almost always unshavenA twentyfoothigh transparent globe floated next  to  his  boatrolling  and  bobbing glistening in the brilliant sun Inside itfloated a wide semicircular sofa  upholstered  in  glorious  redleather  the more the globe bobbed and rolled the more the sofastayed perfectly still steady as an upholstered rock Again alldone for effect as much as anythingZaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed  on  thesofa  He  spread his two arms lazily along the back and with thethird brushed some dust off his knee  His  heads  looked  aboutsmiling  he put his feet up At any moment he thought he mightscreamWater boiled up beneath the bubble it seethed and  spouted  Thebubble  surged  into  the  air  bobbing and rolling on the waterspout Up up it climbed throwing stilts of light at the  cliffUp  it  surged  on  the  jet  the water falling from beneath itcrashing back into the sea hundreds of feet belowZaphod smiled picturing himselfA thoroughly ridiculous  form  of  transport  but  a  thoroughlybeautiful oneAt the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment tipped onto  a railed ramp rolled down it to a small concave platform andriddled to a haltTo tremendous applause  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  stepped  out  of  thebubble his orange sash blazing in the lightThe President of the Galaxy had arrivedHe waited for the applause to die down then raised his hands  ingreetingHi he saidA government spider sidled up to him and  attempted  to  press  acopy  of his prepared speech into his hands Pages three to sevenof the original version were at the moment  floating  soggily  onthe  Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay Pages one andtwo had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle  and  hadalready  become  incorporated  into  an extraordinary new form ofnest which the eagle had invented It was constructed largely  ofpapier  mch and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatchedbaby eagle to break out of it The Damogran Frond  Crested  Eaglehad  heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted notruck with itZaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing  his  set  speech  and  hegently deflected the one being offered him by the spiderHi he said againEveryone beamed at him or at least nearly everyone He singledout  Trillian from the crowd Trillian was a gird that Zaphod hadpicked up recently  whilst  visiting  a  planet  just  for  funincognito  She  was  slim darkish humanoid with long waves ofblack hair a full mouth  an  odd  little  nob  of  a  nose  andridiculously  brown eyes With her red head scarf knotted in thatparticular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she  lookedvaguely  Arabic  Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arabof course The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist and  evenwhen they had existed they were five hundred thousand light yearsfrom Damogran Trillian  wasnt  anybody  in  particular  or  soZaphod  claimed  She  just went around with him rather a lot andtold him what she thought of himHi honey he said to herShe flashed him a quick tight smile and  looked  away  Then  shelooked  back  for  a  moment and smiled more warmly  but by thistime he was looking at something elseHi he said to a small knot of creatures  from  the  press  whowere standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and geton with the quotes He grinned at them  particularly  because  heknew  that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of aquoteThe next thing he said though was not a lot of use to  them  Oneof  the  officials  of  the  party had irritably decided that thePresident was clearly not in  a  mood  to  read  the  deliciouslyturned  speech that had been written for him and had flipped theswitch on the remote control device in his pocket Away in  frontof  them  a  huge  white dome that bulged against the sky crackeddown in the middle split and slowly folded itself down into theground Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well itwas going to do that because they had built it that wayBeneath it lay uncovered a huge starship one hundred  and  fiftymetres  long  shaped  like a sleek running shoe perfectly whiteand mindboggingly beautiful At the heart of it  unseen  lay  asmall  gold  box which carried within it the most brainwretchingdevice ever conceived a device which made this  starship  uniquein  the  history of the galaxy a device after which the ship hadbeen named  The Heart of GoldWow said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold There  wasntmuch else he could sayHe said it again because he knew it would annoy the pressWowThe crowd turned their faces back  towards  him  expectantly  Hewinked  at  Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyesat him She knew what he was about  to  say  and  thought  him  aterrible showoffThat is really amazing he said That really is truly amazingThat is so amazingly amazing I think Id like to steal itA marvellous Presidential quote absolutely  true  to  form  Thecrowd  laughed  appreciatively  the  newsmen  gleefully  punchedbuttons on their SubEtha NewsMatics and the President grinnedAs he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he  fingered  thesmall ParalysoMatic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocketFinally he could bear it no more He lifted his heads up  to  thesky  let out a wild whoop in major thirds threw the bomb to theground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smilesProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight even  for  otherVogons  His  highly  domed  nose  rose  high above a small piggyforehead His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him toplay  the game of Vogon Civil Service politics and play it welland waterproof enough for him  to  survive  indefinitely  at  seadepths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effectsNot that he ever went swimming of course His busy schedule wouldnot allow it He was the way he was because billions of years agowhen the Vogons had first crawled out of  the  sluggish  primevalseas  of  Vogsphere  and  had  lain  panting  and heaving on theplanets virgin shores when the first rays of the bright youngVogsol  sun  had shone across them that morning it was as if theforces of evolution ad simply given up on them  there  and  thenhad  turned  aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly andunfortunate mistake They never evolved again they should  neverhave survivedThe fact that they did is some kind  of  tribute  to  the  thickwilled  slugbrained  stubbornness of these creatures Evolutionthey said to themselves Who needs it and what  nature  refusedto  do  for  them they simply did without until such time as theywere able to rectify the grosser anatomical  inconveniences  withsurgeryMeanwhile the natural forces on the planet  Vogsphere  had  beenworking  overtime  to  make  up  for  their earlier blunder Theybrought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs  which  theVogons  ate  smashing  their  shells  with  iron  mallets  tallaspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which theVogons  cut  down and burned the crab meat with elegant gazellelike creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which  the  Vogonswould  catch  and  sit  on They were no use as transport becausetheir backs would snap instantly but  the  Vogons  sat  on  themanywayThus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia untilthe  Vogons  suddenly  discovered  the principles of interstellartravel Within a  few  short  Vog  years  every  last  Vogon  hadmigrated  to  the  Megabrantis  cluster the political hub of theGalaxy and now formed the  immensely  powerful  backbone  of  theGalactic  Civil Service They have attempted to acquire learningthey have attempted to acquire style and  social  grace  but  inmost  respects  the  modern  Vogon  is  little different from hisprimitive forebears Every year they import twentyseven thousandscintillating  jewelled  scuttling crabs from their native planetand while away a happy drunken night smashing them to  bits  withiron malletsProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he  wasthoroughly vile Also he did not like hitch hikersSomewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines  ofProstetnic   Vogon   Jeltzs   flagship  a  small  match  flarednervously The owner of the match was not a Vogon  but  he  knewall  about  them  and  was right to be nervous His name was FordPrefectHe looked about the cabin but  could  see  very  little  strangemonstrous  shadows  loomed  and  leaped  with the tiny flickeringflame but all was quiet He breathed a silent thank you  to  theDentrassis  The  Dentrassis  are an unruly tribe of gourmands awild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons  had  recently  taken  toemploying  as  catering  staff  on their long haul fleets on thestrict understanding that  they  keep  themselves  very  much  tothemselvesThis suited the Dentrassis fine because they loved Vogon  moneywhich  is one of the hardest currencies in space but loathed theVogons themselves The only sort of Vogon a  Dentrassi  liked  tosee was an annoyed VogonIt was because of  this  tiny  piece  of  information  that  FordPrefect  was  not  now  a  whiff  of  hydrogen  ozone and carbonmonoxideHe heard a slight groan By the light of the match he saw a heavyshape  moving  slightly  on the floor Quickly he shook the matchout reached in his pocket found what he  was  looking  for  andtook it out He crouched on the floor The shape moved againFord Prefect said I bought some peanutsArthur Dent moved and groaned again muttering incoherentlyHere have some urged Ford  shaking  the  packet  again  ifyouve  never  been  through  a  matter  transference beam beforeyouve probably lost some salt and  protein  The  beer  you  hadshould have cushioned your system a bitWhhhrrrr said Arthur Dent He opened his eyesIts dark he saidYes said Ford Prefect its darkNo light said Arthur Dent Dark no lightOne of the things  Ford  Prefect  had  always  found  hardest  tounderstand  about  human  beings  was  their habit of continuallystating and repeating the obvious as in  Its  a  nice  day  orYoure  very  tall  or  Oh  dear  you seem to have fallen down athirtyfoot well are you alright At first  Ford  had  formed  atheory  to  account  for  this strange behaviour If human beingsdont keep  exercising  their  lips  he  thought  their  mouthsprobably   seize  up  After  a  few  months  consideration  andobservation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new  one  Ifthey  dont  keep  on  exercising  their  lips he thought theirbrains start working After a while he abandoned this one as wellas  being  obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked humanbeings after all but  he  always  remained  desperately  worriedabout the terrible number of things they didnt know aboutYes he agreed with Arthur no light  He  helped  Arthur  tosome peanuts How do you feel he askedLike a military academy said  Arthur  bits  of  me  keep  onpassing outFord stared at him blankly in the darknessIf I asked you where the hell  we  were  said  Arthur  weaklywould I regret itFord stood up Were safe he saidOh good said ArthurWere in a small galley  cabin  said  Ford  in  one  of  thespaceships of the Vogon Constructor FleetAh said Arthur this is obviously some strange usage  of  theword safe that I wasnt previously aware ofFord struck another match to help him search for a light  switchMonstrous  shadows  leaped  and loomed again Arthur struggled tohis feet and hugged himself apprehensively Hideous alien  shapesseemed  to  throng about him the air was thick with musty smellswhich sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves and alow irritating hum kept his brain from focusingHow did we get here he asked shivering slightlyWe hitched a lift said FordExcuse me said Arthur Are you trying to tell me that we juststuck  out  our  thumbs and some green bugeyed monster stuck hishead out and said Hi fellas hop right in I can take you as faras the Basingstoke roundaboutWell said Ford the Thumbs an electronic subetha signallingdevice  the roundabouts at Barnards Star six light years awaybut otherwise thats more or less rightAnd the bugeyed monsterIs green yesFine said Arthur when can I get homeYou cant said Ford Prefect and found the light switchShade your eyes  he said and turned it onEven Ford was surprisedGood grief said Arthur is this  really  the  interior  of  aflying saucerProstetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round thecontrol   bridge   He   always   felt  vaguely  irritable  afterdemolishing populated planets He wished that someone would  comeand tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at themand feel better He flopped as heavily as  he  could  on  to  hiscontrol  seat  in  the  hope  that  it  would  break and give himsomething to be  genuinely  angry  about  but  it  only  gave  acomplaining sort of creakGo away he shouted at a young  Vogon  guard  who  entered  thebridge  at  that  moment The guard vanished immediately feelingrather relieved He was glad it wouldnt now be him who deliveredthe  report  theyd  just  received  The  report was an officialrelease which said that a wonderful new form of  spaceship  drivewas  at  this moment being unveiled at a government research baseon Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial  expressroutes unnecessaryAnother door slid open but this time the  Vogon  captain  didntshout  because it was the door from the galley quarters where theDentrassis prepared his meals A meal would be most welcomeA huge furry creature bounded through the  door  with  his  lunchtray It was grinning like a maniacProstetnic Vogon  Jeltz  was  delighted  He  knew  that  when  aDentrassi  looked  that  pleased  with itself there was somethinggoing on somewhere on the ship  that  he  could  get  very  angryindeed aboutFord and Arthur stared about themWell what do you think said FordIts a bit squalid isnt itFord  frowned  at  the  grubby  mattress   unwashed   cups   andunidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around thecramped cabinWell this is a working ship you see said  Ford  These  arethe Dentrassi sleeping quartersI thought you said they were called Vogons or somethingYes said Ford the Vogons run the ship  the  Dentrassis  arethe cooks they let us on boardIm confused said ArthurHere have a look at this said Ford He sat down on one of themattresses  and rummaged about in his satchel Arthur prodded themattress nervously and then sat on it himself  in  fact  he  hadvery  little to be nervous about because all mattresses grown inthe swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed  anddried  before  being  put  to service Very few have ever come tolife againFord handed the book to ArthurWhat is it asked ArthurThe Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Its a sort of  electronicbook  It  tells  you everything you need to know about anythingThats its jobArthur turned it over nervously in his handsI like the cover he said Dont Panic Its the first helpfulor intelligible thing anybodys said to me all dayIll show you how it works said  Ford  He  snatched  it  fromArthur who was still holding it as if it was a twoweekdead larkand pulled it out of its coverYou press this button here you see  and  the  screen  lights  upgiving you the indexA screen about three inches by four lit up and characters beganto flicker across the surfaceYou want to know about Vogons so I enter  that  name  so  Hisfingers tapped some more keys And there we areThe words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared  in  green  across  thescreenFord pressed a large red button at the bottom of the  screen  andwords  began  to  undulate  across it At the same time the bookbegan to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voiceThis is what the book saidVogon Constructor Fleets Here is what to do if you want to  geta  lift  from  a  Vogon  forget  it  They  are  one of the mostunpleasant races in the Galaxy   not  actually  evil  but  badtempered bureaucratic officious and callous They wouldnt evenlift a finger to save their own grandmothers  from  the  RavenousBugblatter  Beast  of  Traal without orders signed in triplicatesent in sent back queried lost  found  subjected  to  publicinquiry lost again and finally buried in soft peat and recycledas firelightersThe best way to get a drink out of a  Vogon  is  to  stick  yourfinger  down  his  throat and the best way to irritate him is tofeed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of TraalOn no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at youArthur blinked at itWhat a strange book How did we get a lift thenThats the point its out of date now said Ford sliding  thebook  back  into its cover Im doing the field research for theNew Revised Edition and one of the things Ill have  to  includeis  a  bit  about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks whichgives us a rather useful little loopholeA pained expression crossed  Arthurs  face  But  who  are  theDentrassi he saidGreat guys said Ford Theyre the best  cooks  and  the  bestdrink  mixers and they dont give a wet slap about anything elseAnd theyll always help hitch hikers aboard partly because  theylike  the company but mostly because it annoys the Vogons Whichis exactly the sort of thing  you  need  to  know  if  youre  animpoverished  hitch  hiker  trying  to  see  the  marvels  of theUniverse for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day And  thatsmy job Fun isnt itArthur looked lostIts  amazing  he  said  and  frowned  at  one  of  the  othermattressesUnfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than  Iintended  said  Ford  I  came  for  a  week and got stuck forfifteen yearsBut how did you get there in the first place thenEasy I got a lift with a teaserA teaserYeahEr what is A teaser Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do Theycruise around looking for planets which havent made interstellarcontact yet and buzz themBuzz them Arthur began to feel that Ford was  enjoying  makinglife difficult for himYeah said Ford they buzz them They find some isolated  spotwith  very  few  people around then land right by some poor soulwhom no ones ever going to believe and then strut up and down infront  of  him  wearing  silly antennae on their heads and makingbeep beep noises Rather childish really Ford leant back on themattress  with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatinglypleased with himselfFord insisted Arthur I dont know  if  this  sounds  like  asilly question but what am I doing hereWell you know that said Ford I rescued you from the EarthAnd whats happened to the EarthAh Its been demolishedHas it said Arthur levellyYes It just boiled away into spaceLook said Arthur Im a bit upset about thatFord frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around hismindYes I can understand that he said at lastUnderstand that shouted Arthur Understand thatFord sprang upKeep looking at the book he hissed urgentlyWhatDont PanicIm not panickingYes you areAlright so Im panicking what else is there to doYou just come along with me and have a good time The Galaxys afun place Youll need to have this fish in your earI beg your pardon asked Arthur rather politely he thoughtFord was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly  had  asmall  yellow fish wriggling around in it Arthur blinked at himHe wished there was something simple and  recognizable  he  couldgrasp hold of He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassiunderwear the piles of Squornshellous  mattresses  and  the  manfrom  Betelgeuse  holding  up a small yellow fish and offering toput it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet  ofcorn flakes He couldnt and he didnt feel safeSuddenly a violent noise leapt at them from  no  source  that  hecould  identify  He  gasped in terror at what sounded like a mantrying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolvesShush said Ford Listen it might be importantIm  importantIts the Vogon captain making an announcement on the TannoyYou mean thats how the Vogons talkListenBut I cant speak VogonYou dont need to Just put that fish in your earFord with a lightning movement clapped  his  hand  to  Arthursear  and  he  had  the  sudden  sickening  sensation of the fishslithering deep into his aural  tract  Gasping  with  horror  hescrabbled  at  his ear for a second or so but then slowly turnedgoggleeyed with wonder He was experiencing the aural equivalentof  looking  at  a  picture  of  two  black silhouetted faces andsuddenly seeing it as a picture of a  white  candlestick  Or  oflooking  at  a  lot  of  coloured  dots on a piece of paper whichsuddenly resolve themselves into the figure  six  and  mean  thatyour  optician  is  going  to charge you a lot of money for a newpair of glassesHe was still listening to the howling gargles he knew that onlynow  it  had  taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforwardEnglishThis is what he heard Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle  howl  garglehowl  howl  gargle  gargle  howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrpuuuurgh should have a good time Message repeats  This  is  yourcaptain   speaking   so  stop  whatever  youre  doing  and  payattention First of all I see from our instruments that we have acouple of hitchhikers aboard Hello wherever you are I just wantto make it totally clear that you  are  not  at  all  welcome  Iworked  hard to get where I am today and I didnt become captainof a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxiservice  for  a load of degenerate freeloaders I have sent out asearch party and as soon that they find you I will put  you  offthe ship If youre very lucky I might read you some of my poetryfirstSecondly we are about to jump into hyperspace for  the  journeyto  Barnards  Star  On  arrival  we  will  stay  in  dock for aseventytwo hour refit and no ones to  leave  the  ship  duringthat time I repeat all planet leave is cancelled Ive just hadan unhappy love affair so I dont see why  anybody  else  shouldhave a good time Message endsThe noise stoppedArthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was  lying  curledup  in  a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round hishead He smiled weaklyCharming man he said I wish I had  a  daughter  so  I  couldforbid her to marry one You wouldnt need to said  Ford  Theyve  got  as  much  sexappeal  as  a  road accident No dont move he added as Arthurbegan to uncurl himself youd better be prepared for  the  jumpinto hyperspace Its unpleasantly like being drunkWhats so unpleasant about being drunkYou ask a glass of waterArthur thought about thisFord he saidYeahWhats this fish doing in my earIts translating for you Its a Babel fish Look it up  in  thebook if you likeHe tossed over The Hitch Hikers Guide to  the  Galaxy  and  thencurled  himself  up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for thejumpAt that moment the bottom fell out of Arthurs mindHis eyes turned inside out His feet began to leak out of the topof his headThe room folded flat about  him  spun  around  shifted  out  ofexistence and left him sliding into his own navelThey were passing through hyperspaceThe Babel fish said The Hitch  Hikers  Guide  to  the  Galaxyquietly  is  small  yellow  and  leechlike  and probably theoddest thing in the Universe It feeds on  brainwave  energy  notfrom  its  carrier  but  from  those  around  it  It absorbs allunconscious mental frequencies  from  this  brainwave  energy  tonourish  itself  with  It  then  excretes  into  the mind of itscarrier a telepathic matrix formed  by  combining  the  consciousthought  frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speechcentres of the brain  which  has  supplied  them  The  practicalupshot  of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your earyou can instantly understand anything said to you in any form  oflanguage  The  speech  patterns  you  actually  hear  decode thebrainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your  BabelfishNow it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that  anythingso  mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance thatsome thinkers have chosen to see it as the  final  and  clinchingproof of the nonexistence of GodThe argument goes something like this I refuse to prove that Iexist says God for proof denies faith and without faith I amnothingBut says Man The Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isnt  itIt  could not have evolved by chance It proves you exist and sotherefore by your own arguments you dont QEDOh dear says God I hadnt thought of  that  and  promptlyvanished in a puff of logicOh that was easy says Man and for  an  encore  goes  on  toprove  that  black  is  white and gets himself killed on the nextzebra crossingMost leading theologians claim that this argument is a  load  ofdingos  kidneys  but  that didnt stop Oolon Colluphid making asmall fortune when he used it as the central theme of  his  bestselling book Well That About Wraps It Up For GodMeanwhile the poor Babel  fish  by  effectively  removing  allbarriers  to  communication between different races and cultureshas caused more and bloddier  wars  than  anything  else  in  thehistory of creationArthur let out a low groan He was horrified to discover that thekick  through  hyperspace hadnt killed him He was now six lightyears from the place that the Earth would have been if  it  stillexistedThe EarthVisions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind  Therewas  no  way  his  imagination could feel the impact of the wholeEarth having gone it was too big He  prodded  his  feelings  bythinking  that  his parents and his sister had gone No reactionHe thought of all the people he had been close to  No  reactionThen  he  thought  of  a  complete  stranger he had been standingbehind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt  a  suddenstab    the  supermarket  was  gone  everything in it was goneNelsons Column

When he came round a second later he found he  wassobbing for his motherHe jerked himself violently to his feetFordFord looked up from where he was sitting in a corner  humming  tohimself He always found the actual travellingthroughspace partof space travel rather tryingYeah he saidIf youre a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earthyou must have been gathering material on itWell I was able to extend the original entry a bit yesLet me see what it says in this edition then Ive  got  to  seeitYeah OK He passed it over againArthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking Hepressed  the  entry for the relevant page The screen flashed andswirled and resolved into a page of print Arthur stared at itIt doesnt have an entry he burst outFord looked over his shoulderYes it does he said down there see at  the  bottom  of  thescreen  just  under  Eccentrica  Gallumbits the triplebreastedwhore of Eroticon Arthur followed Fords finger and saw where it was pointing Fora moment it still didnt register then his mind nearly blew upWhat Harmless Is that all  its  got  to  say  Harmless  OnewordFord shruggedWell there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and  onlya  limited  amount  of  space  in the books microprocessors hesaid and no one knew much about the Earth of courseWell for Gods sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bitOh yes well I managed to  transmit  a  new  entry  off  to  theeditor He had to trim it a bit but its still an improvementAnd what does it say now asked ArthurMostly harmless admitted  Ford  with  a  slightly  embarrassedcoughMostly harmless shouted ArthurWhat was that noise hissed FordIt was me shouting shouted ArthurNo Shut up said Ford I think were in troubleYou think were in troubleOutside the door were the sounds of marching feetThe Dentrassi whispered ArthurNo those are steel tipped boots said FordThere was a sharp ringing rap on the doorThen who is it said ArthurWell said Ford if were lucky its just the Vogons  come  tothrow us in to spaceAnd if were unluckyIf were unlucky said  Ford  grimly  the  captain  might  beserious  in  his  threat  that  hes going to read us some of hispoetry first

poetry of all  perished  along  with  its  creatorPaula  Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge Essex England inthe destruction of the planet EarthProstetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly This was done  not  somuch for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequenceof muscle movements He had had a terribly  therapeutic  yell  athis  prisoners  and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for alittle callousnessThe prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation  Chairs  strapped  inVogons  suffered  no  illusions as to the regard their works weregenerally held in Their early attempts at composition  had  beenpart  of  bludgeoning  insistence  that  they  be  accepted  as aproperly evolved and cultured race but now the only  thing  thatkept them going was sheer bloodymindednessThe sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefects brow and  slid  roundthe  electrodes strapped to his temples These were attached to abattery of electronic equipment  imagery intensifiers  rhythmicmodulators  alliterative  residulators  and simile dumpers  alldesigned to heighten the experience of the  poem  and  make  surethat not a single nuance of the poets thought was lostArthur Dent sat and quivered He had no idea what he was in  forbut  he  knew  that he hadnt liked anything that had happened sofar and didnt think things were likely to changeThe Vogon began to read  a  fetid  little  passage  of

from  a  small  planet in the vicinity ofBetelgeuse and wouldnt have cared if he  had  I  present  youwith  a simple choice Either die in the vacuum of space or he paused for melodramatic effect tell me how good you  thoughtmy poem wasHe threw himself backwards into a huge leathery  batshaped  seatand watched them He did the smile againFord was rasping for breath He rolled his dusty tongue round hisparched mouth and moanedArthur said brightly Actually I quite liked itFord turned and gaped Here was an approach that had quite simplynot occurred to himThe Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow  that  effectively  obscuredhis nose and was therefore no bad thingOh good  he whirred in considerable astonishmentOh yes said Arthur I thought that some of  the  metaphysicalimagery was really particularly effectiveFord continued to stare at him slowly  organizing  his  thoughtsaround  this  totally  new  concept Were they really going to beable to bareface their way out of thisYes do continue  invited the VogonOh  and er  interesting rhythmic devices  too  continuedArthur  which  seemed to counterpoint the  er  er  HeflounderedFord leaped to his rescue hazarding counterpoint the surrealismof  the underlying metaphor of the  er  He floundered toobut Arthur was ready again humanity of the Vogonity Ford hissed at himAh yes Vogonity sorry  of  the  poets  compassionate  soulArthur  felt  he  was  on  a  home  stretch now which contrivesthrough the medium of the  verse  structure  to  sublimate  thistranscend   that   and   come  to  terms  with  the  fundamentaldichotomies  of  the  other  he  was  reaching  a   triumphantcrescendo  and one is left with a profound and vivid insightinto  into  er   which suddenly gave out  on  himFord leaped in with the coup de grceInto whatever it was the poem was about he yelled Out of  thecorner of his mouth Well done Arthur that was very goodThe Vogon perused them For a moment his embittered  racial  soulhad  been  touched  but he thought no  too little too late Hisvoice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylonSo what youre saying is that I write poetry because  underneathmy  mean  callous  heartless  exterior  I  really just want to beloved he said He paused Is that rightFord laughed a nervous laugh Well I mean yes he said  dontwe all deep down you know  er The Vogon stood upNo well youre completely wrong he said I just write poetryto  throw  my  mean callous heartless exterior into sharp reliefIm going to throw you off  the  ship  anyway  Guard  Take  theprisoners to number three airlock and throw them outWhat shouted FordA huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them  out  oftheir straps with his huge blubbery armsYou cant throw us into space yelled Ford  were  trying  towrite a bookResistance is useless shouted the Vogon guard back at him  Itwas  the  first phrase hed learnt when he joined the Vogon GuardCorpsThe captain watched with detached amusement and then turned awayArthur stared round him wildlyI dont want to die now he yelled Ive still got a headacheI  dont  want  to go to heaven with a headache Id be all crossand wouldnt enjoy itThe guard grasped them both firmly round  the  neck  and  bowingdeferentially  towards  his  captains  back  hoiked  them  bothprotesting out of the bridge A steel door closed and the captainwas  on  his  own  again He hummed quietly and mused to himselflightly fingering his notebook of versesHmmmm he said counterpoint the surrealism of the  underlyingmetaphor    He  considered this for a moment and then closedthe book with a grim smileDeaths too good for them he saidThe long steellined corridor echoed to the feeble  struggles  ofthe two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpitsThis is great spluttered Arthur this is really terrific Letgo of me you bruteThe Vogon guard dragged them onDont you worry said  Ford  Ill  think  of  something  Hedidnt sound hopefulResistance is useless bellowed the guardJust dont say things  like  that  stammered  Ford  How  cananyone  maintain  a  positive  mental  attitude  if youre sayingthings like thatMy God complained Arthur youre  talking  about  a  positivemental  attitude  and you havent even had your planet demolishedtoday I woke up this morning and thought Id have a nice relaxedday  do  a bit of reading brush the dog  Its now just afterfour in the afternoon and Im already  thrown  out  of  an  alienspaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the EarthHe spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his gripAlright said Ford just stop panickingWho said anything about panicking  snapped  Arthur  This  isstill  just  the  culture  shock You wait till Ive settled downinto the  situation  and  found  my  bearings  Then  Ill  startpanickingArthur  youre  getting  hysterical  Shut   up   Ford   trieddesperately  to  think but was interrupted by the guard shoutingagainResistance is uselessAnd you can shut up as well snapped FordResistance is uselessOh give it a rest said Ford He twisted his head till  he  waslooking straight up into his captors face A thought struck himDo you really enjoy this sort of thing he asked suddenlyThe Vogon stopped dead and a look  of  immense  stupidity  seepedslowly over his faceEnjoy he boomed What do you meanWhat I mean said Ford is does it give you a full  satisfyinglife Stomping around shouting pushing people out of spaceshipsThe Vogon stared up at the low steel  ceiling  and  his  eyebrowsalmost  rolled  over  each  other  His mouth slacked Finally hesaid Well the hours are good Theyd have to be agreed FordArthur twisted his head to look at FordFord what are you doing he asked in an amazed whisperOh just trying to take an interest in the world around me OKhe said So the hours are pretty good then he resumedThe Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts  moiled  aroundin the murky depthsYeah he said but now you come to mention  it  most  of  theactual  minutes  are  pretty lousy Except  he thought againwhich required looking at the  ceiling    except  some  of  theshouting  I  quite  like  He  filled  his  lungs  and bellowedResistance is Sure yes interrupted Ford hurriedly youre good at that  Ican  tell  But if its mostly lousy he said slowly giving thewords time to reach their mark then why do you do it  What  isit  The  girls  The  leather The machismo Or do you just findthat coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all  presentsan interesting challengeEr  said the guard er  er  I dunno I think  I  justsort of  do it really My aunt said that spaceship guard was agood career for a young Vogon  you know the uniform  the  lowslung stun ray holster the mindless tedium There you are  Arthur  said  Ford  with  the  air  of  someonereaching  the  conclusion  of his argument you think youve gotproblemsArthur rather thought he had Apart from the unpleasant  businesswith  his  home  planet  the  Vogon  guard had halfthrottled himalready and he didnt like the sound of being thrown  into  spacevery muchTry and understand his problem insisted Ford Here he is poorlad  his  entire lifes work is stamping around throwing peopleoff spaceships And shouting added the guardAnd shouting sure said Ford patting the blubbery arm  clampedround  his  neck  in  friendly condescension  and he doesnteven know why hes doing itArthur agreed this was very sad He did this with a small  feeblegesture because he was too asphyxicated to speakDeep rumblings of bemusement came from the guardWell Now you put it like that I suppose Good lad encouraged FordBut  alright  went  on   the   rumblings   so   whats   thealternativeWell said Ford brightly but slowly stop doing it of courseTell  them  he went on youre not going to do it anymore Hefelt he had to add something to that  but  for  the  moment  theguard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that muchEerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  said the  guard erm well that doesnt sound that great to meFord suddenly felt the moment slipping awayNow wait a minute he said thats just  the  start  you  seetheres more to it than that you see But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and  continued  hisoriginal  purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock He wasobviously quite touchedNo I think if its all the same to you he said  Id  betterget you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on withsome other bits of shouting Ive got to doIt wasnt all the same to Ford Prefect after allCome on now  but look he said less slowly less brightlyHuhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn    said  Arthur   without   any   clearinflectionBut hang on pursued Ford theres music and art and things totell you about yet ArrrggghhhResistance is useless bellowed the guard and then added Yousee  if  I  keep  it  up  I can eventually get promoted to SeniorShouting Officer and there arent  usually  many  vacancies  fornonshouting  and  nonpushingpeopleabout  officers so I thinkId better stick to what I knowThey had now  reached  the  airlock    a  large  circular  steelhatchway  of  massive strength and weight let into the inner skinof the craft The guard operated a control and the hatchway swungsmoothly openBut thanks for taking an interest said the Vogon  guard  Byenow  He  flung  Ford  and  Arthur through the hatchway into thesmall  chamber  within  Arthur  lay  panting  for  breath  Fordscrambled  round  and  flung  his  shoulder uselessly against thereclosing hatchwayBut listen he shouted to the guard theres a whole world youdont  know  anything about  here how about this Desperatelyhe grabbed for the only bit of  culture  he  knew  offhand    hehummed the first bar of Beethovens FifthDa da da dum Doesnt that stir anything in youNo said the guard not really But  Ill  mention  it  to  myauntIf he said anything further after that it was lost The  hatchwaysealed itself tight and all sound was lost but the faint distanthum of the ships enginesThey were in a brightly polished cylindrical  chamber  about  sixfeet in diameter and ten feet longPotentially bright lad I thought he said and  slumped  againstthe curved wallArthur was still lying in the curve of the  floor  where  he  hadfallen He didnt look up He just lay pantingWere trapped now arent weYes said Ford were trappedWell didnt you think of anything I thought you said  you  weregoing to think of something Perhaps you thought of something anddidnt noticeOh yes I thought of something panted Ford Arthur  looked  upexpectantlyBut unfortunately continued Ford it rather involved being onthe  other  side  of this airtight hatchway He kicked the hatchtheyd just been throughBut it was a good idea was itOh yes very neatWhat was itWell I hadnt worked out the details yet Not much point now  isthereSo  er what happens nextOh er well the hatchway in front of us will open automaticallyin  a  few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expectand asphyxicate If you take a lungful of air with  you  you  canlast  for up to thirty seconds of course  said Ford He stuckhis hands behind his back raised his eyebrows and started to human  old  Betelgeusian  battle  hymn To Arthurs eyes he suddenlylooked very alienSo this is it said Arthur were going to dieYes said Ford except  no Wait  a  minute  he  suddenlylunged  across  the  chamber at something behind Arthurs line ofvision Whats this switch he criedWhat Where cried Arthur twisting roundNo I was only fooling said Ford we are going to  die  afterallHe slumped against the wall again and carried on  the  tune  fromwhere he left offYou know said Arthur its  at  times  like  this  when  Imtrapped  in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and aboutto die of asphyxication in deep space  that  I  really  wish  Idlistened to what my mother told me when I was youngWhy what did she tell youI dont know I didnt listenOh Ford carried on hummingThis is terrific Arthur thought to himself  Nelsons  Columnhas  gone  McDonalds  have  gone all thats left is me and thewords Mostly Harmless Any second now all that will  be  left  isMostly  Harmless  And yesterday the planet seemed to be going sowellA motor whirredA slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air  as  theouter  hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tinyimpossibly bright points of light Ford and  Arthur  popped  intoouter space like corks from a toy gunThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the  Galaxy  is  a  wholly  remarkablebook  It  has  been compiled and recompiled many times over manyyears  and  under  many  different   editorships   It   containscontributions   from   countless   numbers   of   travellers  andresearchersThe introduction begins like thisSpace it says is big Really big You just wont believe howvastly  hugely mindboggingly big it is I mean you may think itsa long way down the road to the chemist but thats just  peanutsto space Listen  and so onAfter a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tellyou  things  you  really  need  to  know  like the fact that thefabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so  worried  aboutthe  cumulative  erosion  by ten billion visiting tourists a yearthat any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the  amountyou  excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from yourbodyweight when you leave so every time you go to  the  lavatoryit is vitally important to get a receiptTo be fair though when  confronted  by  the  sheer  enormity  ofdistances   between   the   stars  better  minds  than  the  oneresponsible for the  Guides  introduction  have  faltered  Someinvite  you  to  consider  for a moment a peanut in reading and asmall walnut in Johannesburg and other such dizzying conceptsThe simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit intothe human imaginationEven light which travels  so  fast  that  it  takes  most  racesthousands  of years to realize that it travels at all takes timeto journey between the stars It takes  eight  minutes  from  thestar  Sol to the place where the Earth used to be and four yearsmore to arrive at Sols nearest stellar neighbour Alpha ProximaFor light to reach the other side of the Galaxy for it to  reachDamogran for instance takes rather longer five hundred thousandyearsThe record for hitch hiking this  distance  is  just  under  fiveyears but you dont get to see much on the wayThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy says that  if  you  hold  alungful  of  air you can survive in the total vacuum of space forabout thirty seconds However it goes on to say  that  what  withspace  being  the mind boggling size it is the chances of gettingpicked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two  tothe  power  of two hundred and sixtyseven thousand seven hundredand nine to one againstBy a totally staggering coincidence that is  also  the  telephonenumber of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very goodparty and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get  offwith  she went off with a gatecrasherThough the planet Earth the Islington  flat  and  the  telephonehave  all  now  been demolished it is comforting to reflect thatthey are all in some small way  commemorated  by  the  fact  thattwentynine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescuedA computer chatted to itself in alarm as it  noticed  an  airlockopen and close itself for no apparent reasonThis was because Reason was in fact out to lunchA hole had  just  appeared  in  the  Galaxy  It  was  exactly  anothingth  of  a  second  long  a nothingth of an inch wide andquite a lot of million light years from end to endAs it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out ofit  and  drifted off through the universe A team of seven threefoothigh market analysts fell out of  it  and  died  partly  ofasphyxication partly of surpriseTwo hundred and thirtynine thousand lightly fried eggs fell  outof  it  too  materializing in a large woobly heap on the faminestruck land of Poghril in the Pansel systemThe whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except  for  onelast man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks laterThe nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberatedbackwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashionSomewhere in the deeply remote past it  seriously  traumatized  asmall  random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterilityof space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarilyunlikely   patterns   These  patterns  quickly  learnt  to  copythemselves this was part of what was  so  extraordinary  of  thepatterns  and  went  on to cause massive trouble on every planetthey drifted on to That was how life began in the UniverseFive wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of  unreasonand spewed up a pavementOn the pavement lay Ford Prefect and  Arthur  Dent  gulping  likehalfspent fishThere you are gasped Ford scrabbling for a fingerhold on  thepavement  as  it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown Itold you Id think of somethingOh sure said Arthur sureBright idea of mine said Ford to find  a  passing  spaceshipand get rescued by itThe real universe arched sickeningly away beneath  them  Variouspretend  ones  flitted  silently  by like mountain goats Primallight exploded splattering spacetime as with gobbets of junketTime  blossomed  matter  shrank  away  The highest prime numbercoalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for everOh come off it said  Arthur  the  chances  against  it  wereastronomicalDont knock it it worked said FordWhat sort of ship are  we  in  asked  Arthur  as  the  pit  ofeternity yawned beneath themI dont know said Ford I havent opened my eyes yetNo nor have I said ArthurThe Universe jumped froze quivered and splayed out  in  severalunexpected directionsArthur  and  Ford  opened  their  eyes  and   looked   about   inconsiderable surpriseGood god said Arthur it looks just like  the  sea  front  atSouthendHell Im relieved to hear you say that said FordWhyBecause I thought I must be going madPerhaps you are Perhaps you only thought I said itFord thought about thisWell did you say it or didnt you he askedI think so said ArthurWell perhaps were both going madYes said Arthur wed be mad all things considered to thinkthis was SouthendWell do you think this is SouthendOh yesSo do ITherefore we must be madNice day for itYes said a passing maniacWho was that asked ArthurWho  the man with the five heads and the elderberry  bush  fullof kippersYesI dont know Just someoneAhThey both sat on the pavement and watched with a  certain  uneaseas  huge  children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horsesthundered through the sky taking  fresh  supplies  of  reinforcedrailings to the Uncertain AreasYou know  said  Arthur  with  a  slight  cough  if  this  isSouthend theres something very odd about it You mean the way the sea stays steady  and  the  buildings  keepwashing up and down said Ford Yes I thought that was odd tooIn fact he continued as with a huge bang Southend split  itselfinto  six equal segments which danced and span giddily round eachother in lewd  and  licentious  formation  there  is  somethingaltogether very strange going onWild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the windhot  doughnuts  popped out of the road for ten pence each horridfish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make arun for itThey plunged through heavy walls of sound mountains  of  archaic thought  valleys  of  mood music bad shoe sessions and footlingbats and suddenly heard a girls voiceIt sounded quite a sensible voice but it just said Two to  thepower  of  one  hundred thousand to one against and falling andthat was allFord skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find asource  for  the  voice  but could see nothing he could seriouslybelieve inWhat was that voice shouted ArthurI dont know yelled Ford I dont know  It  sounded  like  ameasurement of probabilityProbability What do you meanProbability You know like two to one three to  one  five  tofour against It said two to the power of one hundred thousand toone against Thats pretty improbable you knowA milliongallon vat of custard upended itself over them  withoutwarningBut what does it mean cried ArthurWhat the custardNo the measurement of probabilityI dont know I dont know at all I think were on some kind ofspaceshipI can only assume said Arthur that this is  not  the  firstclass compartmentBulges appeared in the fabric of spacetime Great ugly bulgesHaaaauuurrgghhh  said Arthur as he felt his  body  softeningand  bending in unusual directions Southend seems to be meltingaway  the stars are swirling  a dustbowl   my  legs  aredrifting  off  into the sunset  my left arms come off too Afrightening thought struck him Hell he said how am I  goingto  operate  my digital watch now He wound his eyes desperatelyaround in Fords directionFord he said youre turning into a penguin Stop itAgain came the voiceTwo to the power of seventyfive thousand  to  one  against  andfallingFord waddled around his pond in a furious circleHey who are you he quacked Where are you Whats  going  onand is there any way of stopping itPlease relax said the voice pleasantly like a  stewardess  inan airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is onfire you are perfectly safeBut thats not the point raged Ford The point is that  I  amnow  a  perfectly  save penguin and my colleague here is rapidlyrunning out of limbsIts alright Ive got them back now said ArthurTwo to the power of fifty thousand to one against and  fallingsaid the voiceAdmittedly said Arthur theyre longer than  I  usually  likethem but Isnt there anything squawked Ford in avian  fury  you  feelyou ought to be telling usThe voice cleared its throat A giant  petit  four  lolloped  offinto the distanceWelcome the voice said to the Starship Heart of GoldThe voice continuedPlease do not be alarmed it said by anything you see or heararound you You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as youhave been rescued from certain death at an improbability level oftwo  to  the power of two hundred and seventysix thousand to oneagainst  possibly much higher We are now cruising at a level oftwo  to  the  power  of  twentyfive  thousand to one against andfalling and we will be restoring normality just as  soon  as  weare  sure  what  is normal anyway Thank you Two to the power oftwenty thousand to one against and fallingThe voice cut outFord and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicleFord was wildly excitedArthur he said this is fantastic Weve been picked up by  aship  powered  by  the  Infinite  Improbability  Drive  This  isincredible I  heard  rumors  about  it  before  They  were  allofficially  denied but they must have done it Theyve built theImprobability  Drive  Arthur  this  is      Arthur   WhatshappeningArthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle tryingto  hold  it  closed  but  it was ill fitting Tiny furry littlehands were squeezing themselves through the cracks their fingerswere inkstained tiny voices chattered insanelyArthur looked upFord he said theres an infinite number of  monkeys  outsidewho  want  to  talk  to  us  about this script for Hamlet theyveworked outThe Infinite Improbability Drive is a  wonderful  new  method  ofcrossing  vast  interstellar  distances  in a mere nothingth of asecond without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspaceIt was discovered by a lucky chance and then  developed  into  agovernable  form  of  propulsion  by  the  Galactic  Governmentsresearch team on DamogranThis briefly is the story of its discoveryThe principle of generating small amounts of finite improbabilityby  simply  hooking  the  logic circuits of a Bambleweeny  SubMeson Brain to an atomic vector plotter  suspended  in  a  strongBrownian  Motion  producer  say  a  nice hot cup of tea were ofcourse well understood  and such generators were often  used  tobreak  the  ice  at  parties  by  making all the molecules in thehostesss undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the leftin accordance with the Theory of IndeterminacyMany respectable physicists said that they werent going to standfor  this    partly  because it was a debasement of science butmostly because they didnt get invited to those sort of partiesAnother thing they couldnt stand was the perpetual failure  theyencountered in trying to construct a machine which could generatethe infinite improbability  field  needed  to  flip  a  spaceshipacross  the mindparalysing distances between the furthest starsand in the end they grumpily announced that such  a  machine  wasvirtually impossibleThen one day a student who had been left to sweep  up  the  labafter  a  particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoningthis wayIf  he  thought  to  himself  such  a  machine  is  a   virtualimpossibility  then it must logically be a finite improbabilitySo all I have to do in order to make one is to work  out  exactlyhow   improbable   it  is  feed  that  figure  into  the  finiteimprobability generator give it a fresh cup of  really  hot  tea and turn it onHe did this and was rather startled  to  discover  that  he  hadmanaged   to   create  the  long  sought  after  golden  InfiniteImprobability generator out of thin airIt startled him even more when just  after  he  was  awarded  theGalactic  Institutes Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynchedby a rampaging mob of  respectable  physicists  who  had  finallyrealized  that  the  one  thing  they really couldnt stand was asmartassThe Improbabilityproof control cabin of the Heart of Gold lookedlike  a  perfectly  conventional  spaceship  except  that  it wasperfectly clean because it was so new Some of the control  seatshadnt  had  the  plastic  wrapping  taken off yet The cabin wasmostly  white  oblong  and  about  the  size  of   a   smallishrestaurant  In  fact  it  wasnt  perfectly oblong the two longwalls were raked round in a slight parallel curve  and  all  theangles  and  corners  were contoured in excitingly chunky shapesThe truth of the matter is that it would have been a  great  dealsimpler  and  more  practical  to  build the cabin as an ordinarythreedimensional oblong rom but then the designers  would  havegot  miserable As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposefulwith large video screens ranged over  the  control  and  guidancesystem  panels  on  the concave wall and long banks of computersset into the convex wall In one corner a robot sat  humped  itsgleaming  brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleamingbrushed steel knees It too was fairly new  but  though  it  wasbeautifully  constructed and polished it somehow looked as if thevarious parts of its more or less humanoid body didnt quite  fitproperly  In  fact  they fitted perfectly well but something inits bearing suggested that they might have fitted betterZaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin brushinghis  hands  over  pieces  of gleaming equipment and giggling withexcitementTrillian sat hunched over a  clump  of  instruments  reading  offfigures  Her  voice  was  carried round the Tannoy system of thewhole shipFive to one against and falling   she  said  four  to  oneagainst  and  falling    three  to  one    two   one probability factor of one to one  we have normality I  repeatwe  have  normality She turned her microphone off  then turnedit back on with a slight  smile  and  continued  Anything  youstill  cant  cope  with  is  therefore  your own problem Pleaserelax You will be sent for soonZaphod burst out in annoyance Who are they TrillianTrillian span her seat round to face him and shruggedJust a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open  spaceshe said Section ZZ Plural Z AlphaYeah well thats a very  sweet  thought  Trillian  complainedZaphod   but   do   you   really  think  its  wise  under  thecircumstances I mean here we are on the run and everything  wemust  have  the police of half the Galaxy after us by now and westop to pick up hitch hikers OK so ten out of  ten  for  stylebut minus several million for good thinking yeahHe tapped irritably at a control panel  Trillian  quietly  movedhis  hand  before he tapped anything important Whatever Zaphodsqualities of mind might include  dash bravado conceit  he wasmechanically  inept  and  could  easily  blow the ship up with anextravagant gesture Trillian had come to suspect that  the  mainreason  why  he  had  had such a wild and successful life that henever really understood the significance of anything he didZaphod she said patiently they were floating unprotected  inopen space  you wouldnt want them to have died would youWell you know  no Not as such but Not as such Not die as such But Trillian cocked her head  onone sideWell maybe someone else might have picked them up laterA second later and they would have been deadYeah so if youd taken the trouble to think about the problem abit longer it would have gone awayYoud been happy to let them dieWell you know not happy as such but Anyway said Trillian turning back to the controls I  didntpick them upWhat do you mean Who picked them up thenThe ship didHuhThe ship did All by itselfHuhWhilst we were in Improbability DriveBut thats incredibleNo Zaphod Just very very improbableEr yeahLook Zaphod she said patting his arm dont worry about  thealiens  Theyre  just  a  couple of guys I expect Ill send therobot down to get them and bring them up here Hey MarvinIn the corner the  robots  head  swung  up  sharply  but  thenwobbled  about imperceptibly  It pulled itself up to its feet asif it was about five pounds heavier that  it  actually  was  andmade  what  an  outside  observer would have thought was a heroiceffort to cross the room It stopped in  front  of  Trillian  andseemed to stare through her left shoulderI think you ought to know Im feeling very depressed it  saidIts voice was low and hopelessOh God muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seatWell said Trillian in a  bright  compassionate  tone  heressomething to

convey his utter contempt and horror  of  allthings humanJust that he saidYes said Trillian firmlyI wont enjoy it said MarvinZaphod leaped out of his seatShes not asking you to enjoy it he shouted just do it  willyouAlright said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked  bellIll do itGood  snapped Zaphod great  thank you Marvin turned and lifted his flattopped triangular red  eyes  uptowards himIm not getting you down at all am I he said patheticallyNo no Marvin lilted Trillian thats just fine really I wouldnt like to think that I was getting you downNo dont worry about that the lilt continued you  just  actas comes naturally and everything will be just fineYoure sure you dont mind probed MarvinNo no Marvin lilted Trillian thats just  fine  really  just part of lifeMarvin flashed him an electronic lookLife said Marvin dont talk to me about lifeHe turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself  out  of  thecabin  With  a  satisfied hum and a click the door closed behindhimI

Improbability itpasses through every point in the Universe Be the envy of  othermajor governments Wow this is big league stuffFord hunted excitedly through the technical specs  of  the  shipoccasionally  gasping with astonishment at what he read  clearlyGalactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of  hisexileArthur listened for a short while but being unable to understandthe  vast  majority  of  what Ford was saying he began to let hismind  wander  trailing  his  fingers  along  the  edge   of   anincomprehensible  computer  bank  he  reached out and pressed aninvitingly large red button on a nearby panel The panel  lit  upwith  the  words  Please do not press this button again He shookhimselfListen said  Ford  who  was  still  engrossed  in  the

thatOh it says Genuine People PersonalitiesOh said Arthur sounds ghastlyA voice behind them said It is The voice was low and hopelessand  accompanied  by a slight clanking sound They span round andsaw

to operate  For  yearsradios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turningdials then as  the  technology  became  more  sophisticated  thecontrols  were made touchsensitive  you merely had to brush thepanels with your fingers now all you had to  do  was  wave  yourhand  in  the  general  direction  of the components and hope Itsaved a lot of muscular expenditure of course but meant that youhad to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening tothe same programmeZaphod waved a hand and the channel  switched  again  More  gunkmusic  but this time it was a background to a news announcementThe news was always heavily edited to  fit  the  rhythms  of  themusic and news brought to you here  on  the  subetha  wave  bandbroadcasting  around  the  galaxy  around  the clock squawked avoice and well be saying a big hello to all  intelligent  lifeforms  everywhere   and to everyone else out there the secretis to bang the rocks together guys And of course the big  newsstory  tonight  is the sensational theft of the new ImprobabilityDrive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President ZaphodBeeblebrox And the question everyones asking is  has the bigZ finally flipped Beeblebrox  the  man  who  invented  the  PanGalactic  Gargle Blaster exconfidence trickster once describedby Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One  andrecently  voted  the  Wort  Dressed  Sentinent Being in the KnownUniverse for the seventh time  has he got an answer this timeWe  asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt  Themusic swirled and dived for a moment  Another  voice  broke  inpresumably  Halfrunt  He  said Vell Zaphods jist zis guy youknow but got no further because an electric pencil flew  acrossthe  cabin  and  through  the  radios onoff sensitive airspaceZaphod turned and glared at Trillian  she had thrown the pencilHey he said what do you do that forTrillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figuresIve just thought of something she saidYeah Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me forYou hear enough about yourself as it isIm very insecure We know thatCan we drop your ego for a moment This is importantIf theres anything more important than my ego around I want itcaught and shot now Zaphod glared at her again then laughedListen she said we picked up those couple of guys What couple of guysThe couple of guys we picked upOh yeah said Zaphod those couple of guysWe picked them up in sector ZZ  Plural Z AlphaYeah said Zaphod and blinkedTrillian said quietly Does that mean anything to youMmmmm said Zaphod ZZ  Plural Z Alpha ZZ  Plural Z AlphaWell said TrillianEr  what does the Z mean said ZaphodWhich oneAny oneOne  of  the  major  difficulties  Trillian  experienced  in  herrelationship  with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between himpretending to be stupid just  to  get  people  off  their  guardpretending  to be stupid because he couldnt be bothered to thinkand wanted someone else to  do  it  for  him  pretending  to  beoutrageously  stupid  to  hide  the  fact that he actually didntunderstand what was going on and really being genuinely  stupidHe  was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly wasso  but not all the time which obviously worried him hence theact  He proffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuousThis above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely  stupid  butshe could no longer be bothered to argue about itShe sighed and punched up a star map on  the  visiscreen  so  shecould make it simple for him whatever his reasons for wanting itto be that wayThere she pointed right thereHey  Yeah said ZaphodWell she saidWell whatParts of the inside of her head screamed at other  parts  of  theinside  of her head She said very calmly Its the same sectoryou originally picked me up inHe looked at her and then looked back at the screenHey yeah he said now that is wild We  should  have  zappedstraight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula How did we cometo be there I mean thats nowhereShe ignored thisImprobability Drive she said patiently You explained  it  tome  yourself  We  pass  through every point in the Universe youknow thatYeah but thats one wild coincidence isnt itYesPicking someone up at that  point  Out  of  the  whole  of  theUniverse  to choose from Thats just too  I want to work thisout ComputerThe  Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Shipboard  Computer  whichcontrolled   and  permeated  every  particle of the ship switchedinto communication modeHi there it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tinyribbon  of ticker tape just for the record The ticker tape saidHi thereOh God said Zaphod He hadnt worked with  this  computer  forlong but had already learned to loathe itThe computer continued brash and cheery as  if  it  was  sellingdetergentI want you to know that whatever your problem I am here to helpyou solve itYeah yeah said Zaphod Look I think Ill just use a piece ofpaperSure thing said the computer spilling out its message into  awaste bin at the same time I understand If you ever want Shut up said Zaphod and snatching up a pencil sat  down  nextto Trillian at the consoleOK OK  said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closeddown its speech channel againZaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbabilityflight path scanner flashed silently up in front of themCan we work out said Zaphod from their point  of  view  whatthe Improbability of their rescue wasYes thats a constant said Trillian two to the power of twohundred  and  seventysix  thousand seven hundred and nine to oneagainstThats high Theyre two lucky lucky guysYesBut relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them  upTrillian punched up the figures They  showed  towtothe  powerofInfinityminusone  an  irrational  number  that  only  has aconventional meaning in Improbability physics its pretty low continued Zaphod with a slight whistleYes agreed Trillian and looked at him quizzicallyThats one big whack  of  Improbability  to  be  accounted  forSomething  pretty  improbable  has  got to show up on the balancesheet if its all going to add up into a pretty sumZaphod scribbled a few sums  crossed  them  out  and  threw  thepencil awayBats dots I cant work it outWellZaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation  and  grittedhis teethOK he said ComputerThe voice circuits sprang to life againWhy hello there they said ticker tape ticker tape  All  Iwant to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer Yeah well shut up and work something out for meSure thing chattered the computer  you  want  a  probabilityforecast based on Improbability data yeahOK the  computer  continued  Heres  an  interesting  littlenotion  Did you realize that most peoples lives are governed bytelephone numbersA pained look crawled across one of Zaphods faces and on to  theother oneHave you flipped he saidNo but you will when I tell you that Trillian  gasped  She  scrabbled   at   the   buttons   on   theImprobability flight path screenTelephone number she  said  Did  that  thing  say  telephonenumberNumbers flashed up on the screenThe computer had paused politely but now it continuedWhat I was about to say was that Dont bother please said TrillianLook what is this said ZaphodI dont know said Trillian but those aliens  theyre on theway  up  to the bridge with that wretched robot Can we pick themup on any monitor camerasMarvin trudged on down the corridor still moaning and then of course Ive got this terrible pain  in  all  thediodes down my left hand side No said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him ReallyOh yes said Marvin I mean Ive asked for them to be replacedbut no one ever listensI can imagineVague whistling and humming noises were coming from  Ford  Wellwell well he kept saying to himself Zaphod Beeblebrox Suddenly Marvin stopped and held up a handYou know whats happened now of courseNo what said Arthur who didnt what to knowWeve arrived at another of those doorsThere was a sliding door let  into  the  side  of  the  corridorMarvin eyed it suspiciouslyWell said Ford impatiently Do we go throughDo we go through mimicked Marvin Yes This is  the  entranceto the bridge I was told to take you to the bridge Probably thehighest demand that will be made on  my  intellectual  capacitiestoday I shouldnt wonderSlowly with great loathing he stepped towards the door like  ahunter stalking his prey Suddenly it slid openThank you it said for making a simple door very happyDeep in Marvins thorax gears groundFunny he intoned funerally how  just  when  you  think  lifecant possibly get any worse it suddenly doesHe heaved himself through the  door  and  left  Ford  and  Arthurstaring  at each other and shrugging their shoulders From insidethey heard Marvins voice againI suppose you want to see the aliens now he said Do you wantme  to  sit  in  a  corner and rust or just fall apart where ImstandingYeah just show them in would you Marvin came another voiceArthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughingWhats Shhh said Ford come inHe stepped through into the bridgeArthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a  manlolling  back  in  a  chair  with  his  feet on a control consolepicking the teeth in his righthand head with his left hand  Therighthand  head  seemed  to  be thoroughly preoccupied with thistask but the  lefthand  one  was  grinning  a  broad  relaxednonchalant  grin  The  number  of  things  that  Arthur couldntbelieve he was seeing was fairly large His jaw flapped about  ata loose end for a whileThe peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an  appallingaffectation of nonchalance said Ford hi how are you Glad youcould drop inFord was not going to be outcooledZaphod he drawled great to see you youre looking well theextra arm suits you Nice ship youve stolenArthur goggled at himYou mean you know this guy he said waving a  wild  finger  atZaphodKnow him exclaimed Ford hes  he paused and decided  todo the introductions the other way roundOh Zaphod this is a friend of mine Arthur Dent he said  Isaved him when his planet blew upOh sure said Zaphod hi Arthur glad you could make it  Hisrighthand head looked round casually said hi and went back tohaving his teeth pickedFord carried on And Arthur he said this is  my  semicousinZaphod Beeb Weve met said Arthur sharplyWhen youre cruising down the road  in  the  fast  lane  and  youlazily  sail  past a few hard driving cars and are feeling prettypleased with yourself and  then  accidentally  change  down  fromfourth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap outof your bonnet in a rather ugly mess it tends to throw  you  offyour  stride  in  much  the  same way that this remark threw FordPrefect off hisErr  whatI said weve metZaphod gave an  awkward  start  of  surprise  and  jabbed  a  gumsharplyHey  er have we Hey  er Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his  eyes  Now  hefelt  he  was  back  on  home  ground he suddenly began to resenthaving lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew  asmuch about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilfordbased gnat knewabout life in PekingWhat do you mean youve  met  he  demanded  This  is  ZaphodBeeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know not bloody Martin Smithfrom CroydonI dont care said Arthur coldly Weve met havent we  ZaphodBeeblebrox  or should I say  PhilWhat shouted FordYoull have to remind me said Zaphod Ive a terrible  memoryfor speciesIt was at a party pursued ArthurYeah well I doubt that said ZaphodCool it will you Arthur demanded FordArthur would not be deterred A party six months ago  On  Earth England Zaphod shook his head with a tightlipped smileLondon insisted Arthur IslingtonOh said Zaphod with a guilty start that partyThis wasnt fair on Ford at all He looked backwards and forwardsbetween  Arthur and Zaphod What he said to Zaphod You dontmean to say youve been on that miserable planet as well do youNo of course not said Zaphod breezily Well I may have justdropped in briefly you know on my way somewhere But I was stuck there for fifteen yearsWell I didnt know that did IBut what were you doing thereLooking about you knowHe gatecrashed a party persisted Arthur trembling with angera fancy dress party It would have to be wouldnt it said FordAt this party persisted Arthur was a girl  oh well  lookit  doesnt  matter  now  The  whole  place has gone up in smokeanyway I wish youd stop sulking about that bloody planet said  FordWho was the ladyOh just somebody Well alright I wasnt doing  very  well  withher Id been trying all evening Hell she was something thoughBeautiful charming devastatingly intelligent at last  Id  gother  to  myself  for  a bit and was plying her with a bit of talkwhen this friend of yours barges up and says Hey  doll  is  thisguy  boring  you  Why  dont  you talk to me instead Im from adifferent planet I never saw her againZaphod exclaimed FordYes said Arthur  glaring  at  him  and  trying  not  to  feelfoolish He only had the two arms and the one head and he calledhimself Phil but But you must admit he did turn out to be from  another  planetsaid  Trillian  wandering  into  sight  at  the  other end of thebridge She gave Arthur a pleasant smile  which  settled  on  himlike  a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the shipscontrols againThere was silence  for  a  few  seconds  and  then  out  of  thescrambled mess of Arthurs brain crawled some wordsTricia McMillian he said What are you doing hereSame as you she said I hitched a  lift  After  all  with  adegree  in  Maths and another in astrophysics what else was thereto do It was either that or the dole queue again on MondayInfinity minus one chattered the computer Improbability  sumnow completeZaphod looked  about  him  at  Ford  at  Arthur  and  then  atTrillianTrillian he said is this sort of thing going to happen everytime we use the Improbability driveVery probably Im afraid she saidThe Heart of Gold fled on silently through the  night  of  spacenow  on  conventional  photon drive Its crew of four were ill atease knowing that they had been brought together not of their ownvolition  or by simple coincidence but by some curious principleof physics  as if relationships between people were  susceptibleto  the  same  laws that governed the relationships between atomsand moleculesAs the ships artificial night closed in they were each  gratefulto  retire  to  separate  cabins  and  try  to  rationalize theirthoughtsTrillian couldnt sleep She sat on a couch and stared at a smallcage  which  contained  her  last and only links with Earth  twowhite mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her  bring  She  hadexpected  not  to  see the planet again but she was disturbed byher negative  reaction to the  planets  destruction  It  seemedremote  and  unreal and she could find no thoughts to think aboutit She watched the mice scurrying round  the  cage  and  runningfuriously  in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupiedher whole attention Suddenly she shook herself and went back  tothe  bridge  to  watch  over the tiny flashing lights and figuresthat charted the ships progress through the void She wished sheknew what it was she was trying not to think aboutZaphod couldnt sleep He also wished he knew what it was that hewouldnt  let  himself  think  about  For  as  long  as he couldremember hed suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being  notall there Most of the time he was able to put this thought asideand not worry about it but it had been reawakened by the suddeninexplicable  arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent Somehow itseemed to conform to a pattern that he couldnt seeFord couldnt sleep He was too excited about being back  on  theroad again Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over justas he was finally beginning to give up hope Knocking about  withZaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun though there seemedto be  something  faintly  odd  about  his  semicousin  that  hecouldnt put his finger on The fact that he had become Presidentof the Galaxy was frankly astonishing as was the manner  of  hisleaving the post Was there a reason behind it There would be nopoint in asking Zaphod he never appeared to have  a  reason  foranything  he  did  at all he had turned unfathomably into an artform  He  attacked  everything  in  life  with  a   mixture   ofextraordinary  genius  and  naive  incompetence  and it was oftendifficult to tell which was whichArthur slept he was terribly tiredThere was a tap at Zaphods door It slid openZaphod YeahI think we just found what you came to look forHey yeahFord gave up the attempt to sleep In the corner of his cabin wasa  small  computer  screen and keyboard He sat at it for a whileand tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject  ofVogons but couldnt think of anything vitriolic enough so he gavethat up too wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk  tothe bridgeAs he entered  he  was  surprised  to  see  two  figures  hunchedexcitedly over the instrumentsSee The ships about to move into orbit Trillian was  sayingTheres  a  planet  out there Its at the exact coordinates youpredictedZaphod heard a noise and looked upFord he hissed Hey come and take a look at thisFord went and had a look at  it  It  was  a  series  of  figuresflashing over a screenYou recognize those Galactic coordinates said ZaphodNoIll give you a clue ComputerHi gang enthused the computer This is getting real  sociableisnt itShut up said Zaphod and show up the screensLight on the bridge sank Pinpoints of light  played  across  theconsoles  and  reflected  in four pairs of eyes that stared up atthe external monitor screensThere was absolutely nothing on themRecognize that whispered ZaphodFord frownedEr no he saidWhat do you seeNothingRecognize itWhat are you talking aboutWere in the Horsehead Nebula One whole vast dark cloudAnd I was meant to recognize that from a blank screenInside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy youd see adark screenVery goodZaphod laughed He was  clearly  very  excited  about  somethingalmost childishly soHey this is really terrific this is just far too muchWhats so great about being stuck in a dust cloud said FordWhat would you reckon to find here urged ZaphodNothingNo stars No planetsNoComputer shouted Zaphod rotate angle of vision through  oneeighty degrees and dont talk about itFor a moment  it  seemed  that  nothing  was  happening  then  abrightness  glowed at the edge of the huge screen A red star thesize of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by anotherone    a  binary  system  Then  a vast crescent sliced into thecorner of the picture  a red glare shading away  into  the  deepblack the night side of the planetIve found it cried Zaphod thumping the console Ive  founditFord stared at it in astonishmentWhat is it he saidThat  said Zaphod is the most improbable planet that  everexistedExcerpt from The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Page Section a Entry MagratheaFar back in the mists of ancient time in the great and  gloriousdays  of  the  former  Galactic  Empire  life was wild rich andlargely tax freeMighty starships plied their way  between  exotic  suns  seekingadventure  and  reward  amongst  the furthest reaches of Galacticspace In those days spirits were brave the  stakes  were  highmen  were  real  men  women  were  real  women  and small furrycreatures from Alpha Centauri were  real  small  furry  creaturesfrom  Alpha  Centauri And all dared to brave unknown terrors todo mighty deeds to boldly split  infinitives  that  no  man  hadsplit before  and thus was the Empire forgedMany men of course became extremely rich but this was  perfectlynatural  and  nothing  to be ashamed of because no one was reallypoor  at least no one worth speaking of And for all the richestand  most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dulland niggly and they began to imagine that this was therefore thefault of the worlds theyd settled on  none of them was entirelysatisfactory either the climate wasnt quite right in the  laterpart  of  the afternoon or the day was half an hour too long orthe sea was exactly the wrong shade of pinkAnd thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form ofspecialist industry custommade luxury planet building The homeof this industry was the  planet  Magrathea  where  hyperspatialengineers  sucked  matter through white holes in space to form itinto dream planets  gold planets platinum planets soft  rubberplanets  with lots of earthquakes  all lovingly made to meet theexacting standards that the Galaxys richest men  naturally  cameto expectBut so successful was this venture  that  Magrathea  itself  soonbecame  the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxywas reduced to abject poverty And so the system broke down  theEmpire  collapsed  and  a  long  sullen  silence  settled over abillion worlds disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholarsas  they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on thevalue of a planned political economyMagrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into  theobscurity of legendIn these enlightened days of course no one believes  a  word  ofitArthur awoke to the sound of argument and  went  to  the  bridgeFord was waving his arms aboutYoure crazy Zaphod he was saying Magrathea is  a  myth  afairy  story its what parents tell their kids about at night ifthey want them to grow up to become economists its And thats what we are  currently  in  orbit  around  insistedZaphodLook I cant help what you may personally be in orbit  aroundsaid Ford but this ship Computer shouted ZaphodOh no Hi there This is Eddie your shipboard computer and Im feelingjust  great  guys  and  I know Im just going to get a bundle ofkicks out of any programme you care to run through meArthur looked inquiringly at Trillian She motioned him  to  comeon in but keep quietComputer  said  Zaphod  tell  us  again  what  our   presenttrajectory isA real pleasure feller it burbled we are currently in  orbitat an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planetof MagratheaProving nothing said Ford I wouldnt trust that computer  tospeak my weightI can do that for you sure enthused  the  computer  punchingout  more  tickertape  I  can  even  work  out  you personalityproblems to ten decimal places if it will helpTrillian interruptedZaphod she said any minute now we will be swinging round  tothe daylight side of this planet adding whatever it turns outto beHey what do you mean by that The planets where I predicted itwould be isnt itYes I know theres a planet there Im not arguing with anyoneits  just  that I wouldnt know Magrathea from any other lump ofcold rock Dawns coming up if you want itOK OK muttered Zaphod lets at least give our eyes  a  goodtime ComputerHi there What can I Just shut up and give us a view of the planet againA dark featureless mass once more filled the screens  the planetrolling away beneath themThey watched for a moment in silence but Zaphod was fidgety withexcitementWe are now traversing the night side  he said  in  a  hushedvoice The planet rolled onThe surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath  us  he  continued He was trying to restore a sense of occasionto what he felt should have been a great  moment  Magrathea  Hewas piqued by Fords sceptical reaction MagratheaIn a few seconds he continued we should see  thereThe moment carried itself Even  the  most  seasoned  star  trampcant  help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seenfrom space but a binary sunrise is one of  the  marvels  of  theGalaxyOut of the utter blackness stabbed a  sudden  point  of  blindinglight  It  crept  up  by slight degrees and spread sideways in athin crescent blade and within seconds two  suns  were  visiblefurnaces  of  light  searing  the black edge of the horizon withwhite fire Fierce shafts of colour  streaked  through  the  thinatmosphere beneath themThe fires of dawn   breathed  Zaphod  The  twin  suns  ofSoulianis and Rahm  Or whatever said Ford quietlySoulianis and Rahm insisted ZaphodThe suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low  ghostly  musicfloated through the bridge Marvin was humming ironically becausehe hated humans so muchAs Ford gazed at the spectacle of light  before  them  excitementburnt inside him but only the excitement of seeing a strange newplanet it was enough for him to see it as  it  was  It  faintlyirritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy onto the scene to make it work for him All this Magrathea nonsenseseemed  juvenile  Isnt  it  enough  to  see  that  a  garden isbeautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at thebottom of it tooAll this Magrathea business seemed  totally  incomprehensible  toArthur He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going onI only know what Zaphods told me she  whispered  ApparentlyMagrathea  is  some  kind  of  legend  from way back which no oneseriously believes in Bit like Atlantis on  Earth  except  thatthe legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planetsArthur blinked at the screens and felt he was  missing  somethingimportant Suddenly he realized what it wasIs there any tea on this spaceship he askedMore of the planet was unfolding beneath them  as  the  Heart  ofGold  streaked along its orbital path The suns now stood high inthe black sky the  pyrotechnics  of  dawn  were  over  and  thesurface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the commonlight of day  grey dusty and only dimly  contoured  It  lookeddead  and  cold  as a crypt From time to time promising featureswould appear on the distant horizon  ravines  maybe  mountainsmaybe even cities  but as they approached the lines would softenand blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire The planetssurface  was  blurred  by  time by the slow movement of the thinstagnant air that had crept across it for century upon centuryClearly it was very very oldA moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the  grey  landscapemove  beneath  them  The immensity of time worried him he couldfeel it as a presence He cleared his throatWell even supposing it is It is said ZaphodWhich it isnt continued Ford  What  do  you  want  with  itanyway Theres nothing thereNot on the surface said ZaphodAlright just supposing theres something I take it youre  nothere for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all What are youafterOne of Zaphods heads looked away The other one looked round  tosee  what  the  first  was  looking  at but it wasnt looking atanything very muchWell said Zaphod airily its partly the curiosity partly  asense  of  adventure  but  mostly  I think its the fame and themoney Ford glanced at him sharply He got a very strong impression thatZaphod hadnt the faintest idea why he was there at allYou know I dont like the look of  that  planet  at  all  saidTrillian shiveringAh take no notice said Zaphod with half the wealth  of  theformer  Galactic  Empire  stored on it somewhere it can afford tolook frumpyBullshit thought Ford Even supposing this was the home of  someancient civilization now gone to dust even supposing a number ofexceedingly unlikely things there was no way that vast treasuresof  wealth  were  going to be stored there in any form that wouldstill have meaning now He shruggedI think its just a dead planet he saidThe suspense is killing me said Arthur testilyStress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in allparts  of  the  Galaxy  and  it  is in order that this situationshould not in any way be exacerbated  that  the  following  factswill now be revealed in advanceThe planet in question is in fact the legendary MagratheaThe deadly missile attack shortly to be launched  by  an  ancientautomatic  defence  system  will result merely in the breakage ofthree coffee cups and a  micecage  the  bruising  of  somebodysupper  arm and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowlof petunias and an innocent sperm whaleIn order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved norevelation  will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustainedthe bruise This fact may safely be made the subject of  suspensesince it is of no significance whatsoeverAfter a  fairly  shaky  start  to  the  day  Arthurs  mind  wasbeginning  to  reassemble  itself from the shellshocked fragmentsthe previous day had left him with He had  found  a  NutriMaticmachine  which  had provided him with a plastic cup filled with aliquid that was almost but not quite entirely unlike  tea  Theway it functioned was very interesting When the Drink button waspressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of thesubjects  taste  buds a spectroscopic analysis of the subjectsmetabolism and then  sent  tiny  experimental  signals  down  theneural  pathways  to  the taste centres of the subjects brain tosee what was likely to go down well However no one  knew  quitewhy  it  did  this  because  it  invariably delivered a cupful ofliquid that was almost but not quite entirely unlike  tea  TheNutriMatic   was   designed   and  manufactured  by  the  SiriusCybernetics Corporation whose complaints  department  now  coversall  the  major  land  masses  of  the first three planets in theSirius Tau Star systemArthur drank the liquid and found it reviving He glanced  up  atthe  screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barrengreyness slide past  It  suddenly  occurred  to  him  to  ask  aquestion which had been bothering himIs it safe he saidMagratheas been dead for five million years said Zaphod  ofcourse  its  safe  Even  the  ghosts will have settled down andraised  families  by  now  At  which  point   a   strange   andinexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge  a noiseas of a distant fanfare a hollow reedy insubstantial sound Itpreceded   a   voice   that   was   equally   hollow  reedy  andinsubstantial The voice said Greetings to you Someone from the dead planet was talking to themComputer shouted ZaphodHi thereWhat the photon is itOh just some fivemillionyearold tape thats being  broadcastat usA what A recordingShush said Ford Its carrying onThe  voice  was  old  courteous  almost   charming   but   wasunderscored with quite unmistakable menaceThis is a recorded announcement it said as Im afraid  wereall out at the moment The commercial council of Magrathea thanksyou for your esteemed visit A voice from ancient Magrathea shouted Zaphod OK OK saidFord but regrets continued the voice that the  entire  planetis  temporarily closed for business Thank you If you would careto leave your name and the address of a planet where you  can  becontacted kindly speak when you hear the toneA short buzz followed then silenceThey want to get rid of us said Trillian nervously  What  dowe doIts just a recording said Zaphod We keep going  Got  thatcomputerI got it said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick  ofspeedThey waitedAfter a second or so came the fanfare once again  and  then  thevoiceWe would like to assure you that as  soon  as  our  business  isresumed  announcements  will be made in all fashionable magazinesand colour supplements when our clients will once again be  ableto  select  from  all thats best in contemporary geography Themenace in the voice took on a sharper edge Meanwhile  we  thankour  clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leaveNowArthur looked round the nervous faces of his companionsWell I suppose wed  better  be  going  then  hadnt  we  hesuggestedShhh said Zaphod Theres absolutely nothing  to  be  worriedaboutThen whys everyone so tenseTheyre just interested shouted  Zaphod  Computer  start  adescent into the atmosphere and prepare for landingThis time the fanfare was quite perfunctory the voice distinctlycoldIt is most gratifying it said that your enthusiasm  for  ourplanet  continues  unabated  and  so we would like to assure youthat the guided missiles currently converging with your ship  arepart  of  a  special  service  we  extend  to  all  of  our  mostenthusiastic clients and the fully armed nuclear warheads are ofcourse  merely  a courtesy detail We look forward to your customin future lives  thank youThe voice snapped offOh said TrillianEr  said ArthurWell said FordLook said Zaphod will you get it  into  your  heads  Thatsjust  a  recorded message Its millions of years old It doesntapply to us get itWhat said Trillian quietly about the missilesMissiles Dont make me laughFord tapped Zaphod on  the  shoulder  and  pointed  at  the  rearscreen  Clear  in the distance behind them two silver darts wereclimbing through the atmosphere towards the ship A quick  changeof  magnification  brought  them into close focus  two massivelyreal rockets thundering through the sky The suddenness of it wasshockingI think theyre going to have a very good  try  at  applying  tous said FordZaphod stared at them in astonishmentHey this is terrific he said Someone down there is trying tokill usTerrific said ArthurBut dont you see what this meansYes Were going to dieYes but apart from thatApart from thatIt means we must be on to somethingHow soon can we get off itSecond by second the image of the missiles on the  screen  becamelarger  They had swung round now on to a direct homing course sothat all that could be seen of them now was  the  warheads  headonAs a matter of interest said Trillian what are we  going  todoJust keep cool said ZaphodIs that all shouted ArthurNo were also going to  er  take  evasive  action  saidZaphod  with  a  sudden  access of panic Computer what evasiveaction can we takeEr none Im afraid guys said the computer or something said Zaphod  er  he saidThere  seems  to  be  something  jamming  my  guidance  systemexplained   the   computer  brightly  impact  minus  fortyfiveseconds Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relaxZaphod tried  to  run  in  several  equally  decisive  directionssimultaneously Right he said Er  weve got to get manualcontrol of this shipCan you fly her asked Ford pleasantlyNo can youNoTrillian can youNoFine said Zaphod relaxing Well do it togetherI cant either said Arthur who felt it was time he  began  toassert himselfId guessed that said Zaphod OK computer I want full manualcontrol nowYou got it said the computerSeveral large desk panels slid open and banks of control consolessprang  up  out of them showering the crew with bits of expandedpolystyrene packaging and balls of  rolledup  cellophane  thesecontrols had never been used beforeZaphod stared at them wildlyOK  Ford  he  said  full  retro  thrust  and  ten   degreesstarboard Or something Good luck guys chirped  the  computer  impact  minus  thirtyseconds Ford leapt to the  controls    only  a  few  of  them  made  anyimmediate  sense  to  him  so he pulled those The ship shook andscreamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every whichway  simultaneously  He  released half of them and the ship spanround in a tight arc  and  headed  back  the  way  it  had  comestraight towards the oncoming missilesAir cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyonewas  thrown  against  them For a few seconds the inertial forcesheld them flattened and squirming for  breath  unable  to  moveZaphod  struggled  and  pushed  in  manic desperation and finallymanaged a savage kick at a small lever that formed  part  of  theguidance systemThe lever snapped off The  ship  twisted  sharply  and  rocketedupwards  The  crew  were hurled violently back across the cabinFords copy of The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy smashed intoanother  section  of the control console with the combined resultthat the guide started to explain to anyone who cared  to  listenabout  the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out ofAntares an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick  is  arevolting  but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very largesums of money are often paid for them by  very  rich  idiots  whowant  to  impress  other very rich idiots and the ship suddenlydropped out of the sky like a stoneIt was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crewsustained  a  nasty  bruise  to  the  upper  arm  This should beemphasized because as had already  been  revealed  they  escapeotherwise  completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles donot eventually hit the ship The safety of the crew is absolutelyassuredImpact minus twenty seconds guys  said the computerThen turn the bloody engines back on bawled ZaphodOK sure thing guys said the computer With a subtle roar theengines  cut back in the ship smoothly flattened out of its diveand headed back towards the missiles againThe computer started to singWhen you walk through the storm  it  whined  nasally  holdyour head up high Zaphod screamed at it to shut up but his voice was lost  in  thedin   of  what  they  quite  naturally  assumed  was  approachingdestructionAnd dont  be afraid  of the dark Eddie wailedThe ship in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside downand  lying  on  the  ceiling  as  they  were  it  was now totallyimpossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systemsAt the end of the storm  crooned EddieThe  two  missiles  loomed  massively  on  the  screens  as  theythundered towards the ship is a golden sky But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they  had  not  yet  fullycorrected  their  flight paths to that of the erratically weavingship and they passed right under itAnd the sweet silver songs of the lark  Revised  impact  timefifteen seconds fellas  Walk on through the wind The missiles banked round in a screeching arc  and  plunged  backinto pursuitThis is it said  Arthur  watching  them  We  are  now  quitedefinitely going to die arent weI wish youd stop saying that shouted FordWell we are arent weYesWalk on through the rain  sang EddieA thought struck Arthur He struggled to his feetWhy doesnt anyone turn on this Improbability Drive  thing  hesaid We could probably reach thatWhat are you crazy said Zaphod  Without  proper  programminganything could happenDoes that matter at this stage shouted ArthurThough your dreams be tossed and blown  sand EddieArthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky piecesof  moulded  contouring  where  the  curve  of  the  wall met theceilingWalk on walk on with hope in your heart Does anyone know why Arthur  cant  turn  on  the  ImprobabilityDrive shouted TrillianAnd youll never walk alone  Impact minus five seconds  itsbeen  great knowing you guys God bless  Youll ne  ver walk  aloneI said yelled Trillian does anyone know The next thing that happened  was  a  midmangling  explosion  ofnoise and lightAnd the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart ofGold  continued  on  its  way  perfectly  normally  with a ratherfetchingly redesigned interior It was somewhat larger and  doneout  in delicate pastel shades of green and blue In the centre aspiral staircase leading nowhere in particular stood in a sprayof  ferns  and  yellow  flowers  and  next  to it a stone sundialpedestal housed the main computer  terminal  Cunningly  deployedlighting  and  mirrors  created  the  illusion  of  standing in aconservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely  manicuredgarden  Around  the  periphery  of  the  conservatory area stoodmarbletopped tables on intricately beautiful wroughtiron  legsAs  you  gazed  into the polished surface of the marble the vagueforms of instruments became visible and as you touched them  theinstruments  materialized  instantly  under your hands Looked atfrom the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect  all  therequired  data  readouts though it was far from clear where theywere reflected from It was in fact sensationally beautifulRelaxing in a wickerwork sun chair Zaphod Beeblebrox said Whatthe hell happenedWell I was just saying said Arthur lounging by  a  small  fishpool  theres this Improbability Drive switch over here  hewaved at where it had been There was a potted plant there nowBut where are we said Ford  who  was  sitting  on  the  spiralstaircase  a  nicely  chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in hishandExactly where we were I think  said Trillian as all  aboutthem  the  mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscapeof Magrathea which still scooted along beneath themZaphod leapt out of his seatThen whats happened to the missiles he saidA new and astounding image appeared in the mirrorsThey would appear said Ford doubtfully to have turned into abowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale At an Improbability Factor cut in Eddie who hadnt changed  abit of eight million seven hundred and sixtyseven thousand onehundred and twentyeight to one againstZaphod stared at ArthurDid you think of that Earthman he demandedWell said Arthur all I did was Thats very good thinking you know Turn  on  the  ImprobabilityDrive for a second without first activating the proofing screensHey kid you just saved our lives you know thatOh said Arthur well it was nothing really Was it said Zaphod Oh well forget it  then  OK  computertake us in to landBut I said forget itAnother thing that got forgotten was the fact  that  against  allprobability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existenceseveral miles above the surface of an alien planetAnd since this is not a naturally tenable position for  a  whalethis poor innocent creature had very little time to come to termswith its identity as a whale before it then had to come to  termswith not being a whale any moreThis is a complete record of its  thoughts  from  the  moment  itbegan its life till the moment it ended itAh   Whats happening it thoughtEr excuse me who am IHelloWhy am I here Whats my purpose in lifeWhat do I mean by who am ICalm down get  a  grip  now    oh  this  is  an  interestingsensation  what  is  it  Its  a  sort of  yawning tinglingsensation in my  my    well  I  suppose  Id  better  startfinding  names  for  things if I want to make any headway in whatfor the sake of what I shall call an argument I  shall  call  theworld so lets call it my stomachGood Ooooh its getting quite strong  And  hey  whats  aboutthis  whistling  roaring sound going past what Im suddenly goingto call my head Perhaps I can call that  wind Is that a goodname  Itll do  perhaps I can find a better name for it laterwhen Ive found out what its for  It  must  be  something  veryimportant  because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot ofit Hey Whats this thing This  lets call it a tail  yeahtail  Hey I can can really thrash it about pretty good cant IWow Wow That feels great Doesnt seem to achieve very much butIll probably find out what its for later on Now  have I builtup any coherent picture of things yetNo Never mind hey this is really exciting so  much  to  find  outabout  so  much  to  look  forward  to  Im  quite  dizzy  withanticipation  hspacecm Or is it the windThere really is a lot of that now isnt itAnd wow Hey Whats this thing suddenly coming towards  me  veryfast  Very  very fast So big and flat and round it needs a bigwide sounding name like  ow  ound    round    groundThats it Thats a good name  groundI wonder if it will be friends with meAnd the rest after a sudden wet thud was silenceCuriously enough the only thing that went through  the  mind  ofthe bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no not again Many peoplehave speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of  petuniashad thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of theuniverse than we do nowAre we taking this robot  with  us  said  Ford  looking  withdistaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posturein the corner under a small palm treeZaphod glanced away from the mirror  screens  which  presented  apanoramic  view  of  the blighted landscape on which the Heart ofGold had now landedOh the Paranoid Android he said Yeah well take himBut what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robotYou think youve  got  problems  said  Marvin  as  if  he  wasaddressing  a newly occupied coffin what are you supposed to doif you are a manically  depressed  robot  No  dont  bother  toanswer  that  Im fifty thousand times more intelligent than youand even I dont know the answer It gives  me  a  headache  justtrying to think down to your levelTrillian burst in through the door from her cabinMy white mice have escaped she saidAn expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either ofZaphods facesNuts to your white mice he saidTrillian glared an upset glare at him and disappeared againIt is possible that  her  remark  would  have  commanded  greaterattention  had  it been generally realized that human beings wereonly the third most intelligent life form present on  the  planetEarth  instead  of as was generally thought by most independentobservers the secondGood afternoon boysThe voice was oddly familiar  but  oddly  different  It  had  amatriarchal  twang  It  announced  itself  to  the  crew as theyarrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them  out  on  theplanet surfaceThey looked at each other in puzzlementIts the computer explained Zaphod I discovered  it  had  anemergency  backup  personality  that  I  thought  might work outbetterNow this is going to be your first day  out  on  a  strange  newplanet  continued Eddies new voice so I want you all wrappedup snug and warm  and  no  playing  with  any  naughty  bugeyedmonstersZaphod tapped impatiently on the hatchIm sorry he said I think we might  be  better  off  with  aslide ruleRight snapped the computer Who said thatWill you open the exit  hatch  please  computer  said  Zaphodtrying not to get angryNot until whoever  said  that  owns  up  urged  the  computerstamping a few synapses closedOh God muttered Ford slumped against a bulkhead  and  startedto  count  to  ten  He  was  desperately  worried  that  one daysentinent life forms  would  forget  how  to  do  this  Only  bycounting   could   humans   demonstrate   their  independence  ofcomputersCome on said Eddie sternlyComputer  began Zaphod Im  waiting  interrupted  Eddie  I  can  wait  all  day  ifnecessary Computer  said Zaphod again who had been trying to think ofsome subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with andhad decided not to bother competing with it on  its  own  groundif  you  dont  open  that  exit  hatch  this moment I shall zapstraight off to your major data banks and reprogram  you  with  avery large axe got thatEddie shocked paused and considered thisFord  carried  on  counting  quietly  This  is  about  the  mostaggressive  thing  you  can  do  to a computer the equivalent ofgoing up to a human being and saying Blood   blood    blood blood Finally Eddie said quietly  I  can  see  this  relationship  issomething  were  all going to have to work at and the hatchwayopenedAn icy wind ripped into them they hugged themselves  warmly  andstepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of MagratheaItll all end in tears I know it shouted Eddie after them andclosed the hatchway againA few minutes later he opened and closed the  hatchway  again  inresponse to a command that caught him entirely by surpriseFive figures wandered slowly over the blighted land Bits  of  itwere  dullish  grey  bits  of  it  dullish brown the rest of itrather less interesting to look  at  It  was  like  a  driedoutmarsh  now  barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer ofdust about an inch thick It was very coldZaphod was clearly rather depressed about it He stalked  off  byhimself  and  was  soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in thegroundThe wind stung Arthurs eyes and ears and  the  stale  thin  airclasped his throat However the thing stung most was his mindIts fantastic  he said and his own voice rattled his earsSound carried badly in this thin atmosphereDesolate hole if you ask me said Ford I could have more  funin  a  cat  litter  He  felt  a mounting irritation Of all theplanets in all the star systems of all the  Galaxy    didnt  hejust  have  to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years ofbeing a castaway Not even  a  hot  dog  stand  in  evidence  Hestooped  down  and  picked up a cold clot of earth but there wasnothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of light years  tolook atNo insisted Arthur dont you understand this is  the  firsttime  Ive  actually stood on the surface of another planet  awhole alien world  Pity its such a dump thoughTrillian hugged herself shivered and  frowned  She  could  havesworn  she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the cornerof her eye but when she glanced in that direction all she  couldsee  was the ship still and silent a hundred yards or so behindthemShe was relieved when a second or so later they caught  sight  ofZaphod  standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to themto come and join himHe seemed to be excited but they couldnt clearly hear  what  hewas saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the windAs they approached the ridge of higher ground they  became  awarethat  it  seemed  to  be  circular  a crater about a hundred andfifty yards wide Round the outside of  the  crater  the  slopingground  was  spattered with black and red lumps They stopped andlooked at a piece It was wet It was rubberyWith horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeatAt the top of the craters lip they met ZaphodLook he said pointing into the craterIn the centre lay the exploded carcass of a  lonely  sperm  whalethat  hadnt  lived  long enough to be disappointed with its lotThe silence was only disturbed by the slight  involuntary  spasmsof Trillians throatI suppose theres no point  in  trying  to  bury  it  murmuredArthur and then wished he hadntCome said Zaphod and started back down into the craterWhat down there said Trillian with severe distasteYeah said Zaphod come on Ive got something to show youWe can see it said TrillianNot that said Zaphod something else Come onThey all hesitatedCome on insisted Zaphod Ive found a way inIn said Arthur in horrorInto the interior of the planet  An  underground  passage  Theforce  of the whales impact cracked it open and thats where wehave to go Where no man has trod these five million years  intothe very depths of time itself Marvin started his ironical humming againZaphod hit him and he shut upWith little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down theincline  into  the  crater  trying  very hard not to look at itsunfortunate creatorLife said Marvin dolefully loathe it or ignore it you cantlike itThe ground had caved in where the whale had hit  it  revealing  anetwork  of  galleries  and  passages  now largely obstructed bycollapsed rubble and entrails Zaphod had made a start clearing away into one of them but Marvin was able to do it rather fasterDank air wafted out of its dark recesses and as Zaphod  shone  atorch into it little was visible in the dusty gloomAccording to the legends he said the Magratheans lived  mostof their lives undergroundWhys that said Arthur Did the surface become  too  pollutedor overpopulatedNo I dont think so said Zaphod I think  they  just  didntlike it very muchAre you sure you know what youre doing said Trillian  peeringnervously  into  the  darkness Weve been attacked once alreadyyou knowLook kid I promise you the live population of  this  planet  isnil  plus  the four of us so come on lets get on in there Erhey Earthman Arthur said ArthurYeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you  and  guardthis end of the passageway OKGuard said Arthur What from You just said  theres  no  onehereYeah well just for safety OK said ZaphodWhose Yours or mineGood lad OK here we goZaphod scrambled down into the passage followed by Trillian  andFordWell I hope you all have a really  miserable  time  complainedArthurDont worry Marvin assured him they willIn a few seconds they had disappeared from viewArthur stamped around in a huff and then decided that a  whalesgraveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around inMarvin eyed him balefully for a moment and then  turned  himselfoffZaphod marched quickly down the passageway nervous as hell  buttrying  to  hide  it by striding purposefully He flung the torchbeam around The walls were covered in dark tiles and  were  coldto the touch the air thick with decayThere what did I tell you  he  said  An  inhabited  planetMagrathea  and  he  strode  on through the dirt and debris thatlittered the tile floorTrillian was reminded  unavoidably  of  the  London  Undergroundthough it was less thoroughly squalidAt intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large  mosaics simple angular patterns in bright colours Trillian stopped andstudied one of them but could not interpret any  sense  in  themShe called to ZaphodHey have you any idea what these strange symbols areI think theyre just strange symbols of some kind said Zaphodhardly glancing backTrillian shrugged and hurried after himFrom time to time a doorway led either to the left or right  intosmallish  chambers  which  Ford discovered to be full of derelictcomputer equipment He dragged Zaphod into one to  have  a  lookTrillian followedLook said Ford you reckon this is Magrathea Yeah said Zaphod and we heard the voice rightOK so Ive bought the  fact  that  its  Magrathea    for  themoment  What  you  have  so far said nothing about is how in theGalaxy you found it You didnt just look it up in a star  atlasthats for sureResearch  Government  archives  Detective  work   Few   luckyguesses EasyAnd then you stole the Heart of Gold to come  and  look  for  itwithI stole it to look for a lot of thingsA lot of things said Ford in surprise Like whatI dont knowWhatI dont know what Im looking forWhy notBecause  because  I think it might be because if I knew  Iwouldnt be able to look for themWhat are you crazyIts a  possibility  I  havent  ruled  out  yet  said  Zaphodquietly  I  only  know as much about myself as my mind can workout under its current conditions And its current conditions  arenot goodFor a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod witha mind suddenly full of worryListen old friend if you want to  started Ford eventuallyNo wait  Ill tell you something said Zaphod I freewheela lot I get an idea to do something and hey why not I do itI reckon Ill  become  President  of  the  Galaxy  and  it  justhappens its easy I decide to steal this ship I decide to lookfor Magrathea and it all just happens Yeah I work out  how  itcan  best  be  done  right  but  it always works out Its likehaving a Galacticredit card which keeps  on  working  though  younever  send off the cheques And then whenever I stop and think why did I want to do something  how did I work out  how  to  doit   I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about itLike I have now Its a big effort to talk about itZaphod paused for a while For a while there was silence Then hefrowned  and  said  Last night I was worrying about this againAbout the fact that part of my mind  just  didnt  seem  to  workproperly  Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was thatsomeone else was using my mind to have good ideas  with  withouttelling  me  about  it  I put the two ideas together and decidedthat maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for  thatpurpose which was why I couldnt use it I wondered if there wasa way I could checkI went to the ships medical bay and  plugged  myself  into  theencephelographic  screen  I  went  through every major screeningtest on both my heads  all the tests I had to go  through  undergovernment  medical  officers before my nomination for Presidencycould be properly  ratified  They  showed  up  nothing  Nothingunexpected  at least They showed that I was clever imaginativeirresponsible untrustworthy  extrovert  nothing  you  couldnthave  guessed  And  no  other  anomalies So I started inventingfurther tests  completely  at  random  Nothing  Then  I  triedsuperimposing  the  results  from  one head on top of the resultsfrom the other head Still nothing Finally I got silly  becauseId  given  it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoiaLast thing I did before I packed it in was take the  superimposedpicture and look at it through a green filter You remember I wasalways superstitious about the color green when I was  a  kid  Ialways wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scoutsFord noddedAnd there it was said Zaphod clear as day A  whole  sectionin  the middle of both brains that related only to each other andnot to anything else around them Some bastard had cauterized allthe  synapses  and  electronically traumatised those two lumps ofcerebellumFord stared at him aghast Trillian had turned whiteSomebody did that to you whispered FordYeahBut have you any idea who Or whyWhy I can only guess But I do know who the bastard wasYou know How do you knowBecause they left  their  initials  burnt  into  the  cauterizedsynapses They left them there for me to seeFord stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawlInitials Burnt into your brainYeahWell what were they for Gods sakeZaphod looked at him in silence  again  for  a  moment  Then  helooked awayZB he saidAt that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them  and  gasstarted to pour into the chamberIll tell you about it later choked Zaphod as all three passedoutOn the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodilyFord had thoughtfully left him his  copy  of  The  Hitch  HikersGuide  to the Galaxy to while away the time with He pushed a fewbuttons at randomThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a very  unevenly  editedbook and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editorslike a good idea at the timeOne of these the one Arthur now came across supposedly  relatesthe  experiences  of  one Veet Voojagig a quiet young student atthe University of Maximegalon who pursued a  brilliant  academiccareer  studying  ancient  philology transformational ethics andthe wave harmonic theory  of  historical  perception  and  thenafter  a  night  of  drinking  Pan  Galactic Gargle Blasters withZaphod Beeblebrox became increasingly obsessed with the  problemof  what  had happened to all the biros hed bought over the pastfew yearsThere followed a long period of painstaking research during whichhe  visited  all  the  major  centres of biro loss throughout thegalaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little  theory  whichquite caught the public imagination at the time Somewhere in thecosmos  he  said  along  with  all  the  planets  inhabited  byhumanoids    reptiloids    fishoids   walking   treeoids   andsuperintelligent shades of the colour  blue  there  was  also  aplanet entirely given over to biro life forms And it was to thisplanet that unattended biros would make their way slipping  awayquietly  through  wormholes  in  space to a world where they knewthey could enjoy  a  uniquely  biroid  lifestyle  responding  tohighly  birooriented  stimuli  and  generally  leading the biroequivalent of the good lifeAnd as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until VeetVoojagig  suddenly claimed to have found this planet and to haveworked there for a while driving a  limousine  for  a  family  ofcheap green retractables whereupon he was taken away locked upwrote a book and was finally sent into tax exile which  is  theusual  fate  reserved for those who are determined to make a foolof themselves in publicWhen one day an expedition was sent to  the  spatial  coordinatesthat  Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only asmall asteroid inhabited  by  a  solitary  old  man  who  claimedrepeatedly  that nothing was true though he was later discoveredto be lyingThere did however remain the question of  both  the  mysterious  Altairan  dollars  paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bankaccount and of  course  Zaphod  Beeblebroxs  highly  profitablesecondhand biro businessArthur read this and put the book downThe robot still sat there completely inertArthur got up and walked to the top  of  the  crater  He  walkedaround  the  crater  He  watched two suns set magnificently overMagratheaHe went back down into the crater He woke the robot  up  becauseeven  a  manically  depressed  robot  is  better  to talk to thannobodyNights falling he said Look robot  the  stars  are  comingoutFrom the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to  see  very  fewstars and only very faintly but they were there to be seenThe robot obediently looked at them then looked backI know he said Wretched isnt itBut that sunset Ive never seen anything like it in my  wildestdreams    the  two suns It was like mountains of fire boilinginto spaceIve seen it said Marvin Its rubbishWe only ever had the one sun at  home  persevered  Arthur  Icame from a planet called Earth you knowI know said Marvin you keep going on  about  it  It  soundsawfulAh no it was a beautiful placeDid it have oceansOh yes said Arthur with  a  sigh  great  wide  rolling  blueoceans Cant bear oceans said MarvinTell me inquired Arthur  do  you  get  on  well  with  otherrobotsHate them said Marvin Where are you goingArthur couldnt bear any more He had got up againI think Ill just take another walk he saidDont blame you said  Marvin  and  counted  five  hundred  andninetyseven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again asecond laterArthur slapped  his  arms  about  himself  to  try  and  get  hiscirculation  a little more enthusiastic about its job He trudgedback up the wall of the craterBecause the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moonnightfall  was very rapid and it was by now very dark Because ofthis Arthur practically  walked  into  the  old  man  before  henoticed himHe was standing with his back to Arthur watching  the  very  lastglimmers  of light sink into blackness behind the horizon He wastallish elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe When  heturned  his  face  was  thin  and distinguished careworn but notunkind the sort of face you would  happily  bank  with  But  hedidnt turn yet not even to react to Arthurs yelp of surpriseEventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely  andhe  turned  His  face  was still illuminated from somewhere andwhen Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a  fewyards away stood a small craft of some kind  a small hovercraftArthur guessed It shed a dim pool of light around itThe man looked at Arthur sadly it seemedYou choose a cold night to visit our dead planet he saidWho  who are you stammered ArthurThe man looked away Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross  hisfaceMy name is not important he saidHe seemed to have something on his mind Conversation was clearlysomething he felt he didnt have to rush at Arthur felt awkwardI  er  you startled me  he said lamelyThe man looked  round  to  him  again  and  slightly  raised  hiseyebrowsHmmmm he saidI said you startled meDo not be alarmed I will not harm youArthur frowned at him But you shot at us There  were  missiles he saidThe man chuckled slightlyAn automatic system he said and gave a  small  sigh  Ancientcomputers  ranged  in the bowels of the planet tick away the darkmillennia and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data  banks  Ithink they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotonyHe looked gravely at Arthur and said Im a great fan of scienceyou knowOh  er really said Arthur who was beginning to  find  themans curious kindly manner disconcertingOh yes said the old man and simply stopped talking againAh said Arthur er  He had an odd felling of being like aman  in  the  act  of  adultery who is surprised when the womanshusband wanders into the room changes his trousers passes a fewidle remarks about the weather and leaves againYou seem ill at ease said the old man with polite concernEr no  well  yes  Actually  you  see  we  werent  reallyexpecting  to find anybody about in fact I sort of gathered thatyou were all dead or something Dead said the old man Good gracious no we have but sleptSlept said Arthur incredulouslyYes through the economic recession you see said the old  manapparently  unconcerned  about  whether  Arthur understood a wordhe was talking about or notEr economic recessionWell you see  five  million  years  ago  the  Galactic  economycollapsed and seeing that custommade planets are something of aluxury commodity you see He paused and looked at ArthurYou know we built planets do you he asked solemnlyWell yes said Arthur Id sort of gathered Fascinating trade said the old man and a  wistful  look  cameinto  his  eyes  doing  the coastlines was always my favouriteUsed to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords    soanyway  he said trying to find his thread again the recessioncame and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if  we  justslept  through  it  So  we programmed the computers to revive uswhen it was all overThe man stifled a very slight yawn and continuedThe computers were index linked to  the  Galactic  stock  marketprices  you  see so that wed all be revived when everybody elsehad rebuilt the economy enough to  afford  our  rather  expensiveservicesArthur a regular Guardian reader was deeply shocked at thisThats a pretty unpleasant way to behave isnt itIs it asked the old man mildly Im sorry Im a bit  out  oftouchHe pointed down into the craterIs that robot yours he saidNo came a thin metallic voice from the crater Im mineIf youd call it a robot muttered Arthur Its more a sort ofelectronic sulking machineBring it said the old man Arthur was quite surprised to  heara  note  of  decision suddenly present in the old mans voice Hecalled to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a  big  show  ofbeing lame which he wasntOn second thoughts said the old man leave it here You  mustcome  with  me  Great  things  are afoot He turned towards hiscraft which though  no  apparent  signal  had  been  given  nowdrifted quietly towards them through the darkArthur looked down at Marvin who now made an equally big show ofturning  round  laboriously and trudging off down into the crateragain muttering sour nothings to himselfCome called the old man come now or you will be lateLate said Arthur What forWhat is your name humanDent Arthur Dent said ArthurLate as in the late Dentarthurdent said the old man sternlyIts  a  sort of threat you see Another wistful look came intohis tired old eyes Ive never been very good  at  them  myselfbut Im told they can be very effectiveArthur blinked at himWhat an extraordinary person he muttered to himselfI beg your pardon said the old manOh nothing Im sorry said Arthur in embarrassment  Alrightwhere do we goIn my aircar said the old man motioning Arthur to get into thecraft which had settled silently next to them We are going deepinto the bowels of the planet where even now our  race  is  beingrevived from its fivemillionyear slumber Magrathea awakesArthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself  next  to  theold  man  The  strangeness of it the silent bobbing movement ofthe craft as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled himHe looked at the old man his face illuminated by the  dull  glowof tiny lights on the instrument panelExcuse me he said to him what is your name by the wayMy name said the old man and the same  distant  sadness  cameinto  his  face  again  He  paused  My name he said  isSlartibartfastArthur practically chokedI beg your pardon he splutteredSlartibartfast repeated the old man quietlySlartibartfastThe old man looked at him gravelyI said it wasnt important he saidThe aircar sailed through the nightIt is an important and popular fact that things  are  not  alwayswhat they seem For instance on the planet Earth man had alwaysassumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he hadachieved  so  much  the wheel New York wars and so on  whilstall the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water havinga  good  time  But  conversely the dolphins had always believedthat they were far more intelligent than man  for precisely  thesame reasonsCuriously enough the dolphins had long known  of  the  impendingdestruction  of  the  planet  Earth and had made many attempts toalert mankind of the danger but  most  of  their  communicationswere  misinterpreted  as  amusing  attempts to punch footballs orwhistle for tidbits so they eventually  gave  up  and  left  theEarth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrivedThe  last  ever  dolphin  message   was   misinterpreted   as   asurprisingly  sophisticated  attempt  to  do  a doublebackwardssomersault through a hoop whilst whistling  the  Star  SprangledBanner but in fact the message was this So long and thanks forall the fishIn fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligentthan  dolphins and they spent a lot of their time in behaviouralresearch laboratories running round inside wheels and  conductingfrighteningly  elegant  and  subtle  experiments on man The  fact  that  once  again man  completely misinterpreted  this  relationship was entirely according to these creatures plansSilently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness  a  singlesoft  glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magratheannight It sped swiftly Arthurs companion seemed sunk in his ownthoughts  and  when  Arthur  tried  on  a couple of occasions toengage him in conversation again he would simply reply by  askingif he was comfortable enough and then left it at thatArthur tried to gauge the speed at which  they  were  travellingbut  the  blackness  outside  was  absolute and he was denied anyreference points The sense of motion was so soft and  slight  hecould almost believe they were hardly moving at allThen a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and withinseconds  had  grown  so  much in size that Arthur realized it wastravelling towards them at a colossal speed and he tried to makeout  what  sort  of  craft  it might be He peered at it but wasunable to discern any clear shape and suddenly gasped  in  alarmas  the  aircraft  dipped  sharply  and  headed downwards in whatseemed certain to be a collision course Their relative  velocityseemed  unbelievable  and  Arthur had hardly time to draw breathbefore it was all over The next thing he was  aware  of  was  aninsane  silver  blur  that seemed to surround him He twisted hishead sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling  rapidlyin  the  distance behind them and it took him several seconds torealize what had happenedThey had plunged into a tunnel in the ground The colossal  speedhad  been  their  own  relative  to the glow of light which was astationary hole in the ground  the  mouth  of  the  tunnel  Theinsane  blur  of  silver was the circular wall of the tunnel downwhich they were shooting apparently at several hundred miles  anhourHe closed his eyes in terrorAfter a length of time which he made  no  attempt  to  judge  hesensed  a  slight  subsidence in their speed and some while laterbecame aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle haltHe opened his eyes again They were still in the  silver  tunnelthreading  and  weaving  their  way through what appeared to be acrisscross  warren  of  converging  tunnels  When  they  finallystopped  it  was  in  a  small  chamber  of curved steel Severaltunnels also had their terminus here and at the farther  end  ofthe  chamber  Arthur  could  see a large circle of dim irritatinglight It was irritating because it played tricks with the  eyesit was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or farit was Arthur guessed quite wrongly that  it  might  be  ultravioletSlartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur  with  his  solemn  oldeyesEarthman he said we are now deep in the heart of MagratheaHow did you know I was an Earthman demanded ArthurThese things will become clear to you said the old man gentlyat  least  he  added  with slight doubt in his voice clearerthan they are at the momentHe continued I should warn you that the chamber we are about topass  into  does  not  literally exist within our planet It is alittle too  large We are about to pass through a gateway intoa vast tract of hyperspace It may disturb youArthur made nervous noisesSlartibartfast  touched  a  button  and   added   not   entirelyreassuringly It scares the willies out of me Hold tightThe car shot forward straight  into  the  circle  of  light  andsuddenly  Arthur  had a fairly clear idea of what infinity lookedlikeIt wasnt infinity  in  fact  Infinity  itself  looks  flat  anduninteresting  Looking  up  into  the  night sky is looking intoinfinity      distance   is   incomprehensible   and   thereforemeaningless  The  chamber  into  which  the  aircar  emerged wasanything but infinite it was just very very big so that it gavethe impression of infinity far better than infinity itselfArthurs senses bobbed and span as travelling  at  the  immensespeed  he  knew  the aircar attained they climbed slowly throughthe open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed aninvisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind themThe wallThe wall defied the imagination  seduced it and defeated it Thewall  was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top bottom andsides passed away beyond the reach of sight The  mere  shock  ofvertigo could kill a manThe wall appeared perfectly flat It would take the finest  lasermeasuring  equipment  to detect that as it climbed apparently toinfinity as it dropped dizzily away as it planed out to  eitherside  it also curved It met itself again thirteen light secondsaway In other words the wall  formed  the  inside  of  a  hollowsphere a sphere over three million miles across and flooded withunimaginable lightWelcome said Slartibartfast as the tiny  speck  that  was  theaircar  travelling  now at three times the speed of sound creptimperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space welcome  hesaid to our factory floorArthur stared about him in a kind  of  wonderful  horror  Rangedaway  before  them  at distances he could neither judge nor evenguess  at  were  a  series  of  curious  suspensions   delicatetraceries  of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapesthat hung in the spaceThis said Slartibartfast  is  where  we  make  most  of  ourplanets you seeYou mean said Arthur trying to  form  the  words  you  meanyoure starting it all up again nowNo no good heavens no exclaimed the old man no the  Galaxyisnt  nearly  rich  enough  to  support  us  yet No weve beenawakened to perform just one extraordinary commission   for  very  special  clients from another dimension It may interest you there in the distance in front of usArthur followed the old mans finger till he was  able  to  pickout the floating structure he was pointing out It was indeed theonly one of  the  many  structures  that  betrayed  any  sign  ofactivity  about  it  though  this was more a sublimal impressionthan anything one could put ones finger onAt the  moment  however  a  flash  of  light  arced  through  thestructure  and  revealed  in  stark relief the patterns that wereformed on the dark sphere  within  Patterns  that  Arthur  knewrough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes ofwords part of the furniture of his mind For a  few  seconds  hesat  in  stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind andtried to find somewhere to settle down and make sensePart of his brain told him that he knew perfectly  well  what  hewas  looking  at  and  what the shapes represented whilst anotherquite sensibly refused to  countenance  the  idea  and  abdicatedresponsibility for any further thinking in that directionThe flash came again and this time there could be no doubtThe Earth  whispered ArthurWell  the  Earth  Mark  Two  in  fact   said   Slartibartfastcheery Were making a copy from our original blueprintsThere was a pauseAre you trying  to  tell  me  said  Arthur  slowly  and  withcontrol that you originally  made the EarthOh yes said Slartibartfast Did you ever go to a place   Ithink it was called NorwayNo said Arthur no I didntPity said Slartibartfast that was one of mine Won an  awardyou  know  Lovely  crinkly edges I was most upset to hear aboutits destructionYou were upsetYes Five minutes later and it wouldnt have mattered  so  muchIt was a quite shocking cockupHuh said ArthurThe mice were furiousThe mice were furiousOh yes said the old man mildlyYes well so I expect were  the  dogs  and  cats  and  duckbilledplatypuses but Ah but they hadnt paid for it you see had theyLook said Arthur would it save you a lot of time if  I  justgave up and went mad nowFor a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence Then  the  oldman tried patiently to explainEarthman the planet you lived on was  commissioned  paid  forand  run  by  mice  It  was  destroyed  five  minutes before thecompletion of the purpose for which it was built and  weve  gotto build another oneOnly one word registered with ArthurMice he saidIndeed EarthmanLook sorry  are we talking about the little white furry thingswith  the  cheese fixation and women standing on tables screamingin early sixties sit comsSlartibartfast coughed politelyEarthman he said it is sometimes hard to follow your mode ofspeech  Remember  I  have  been  asleep  inside  this  planet ofMagrathea for five million years and know little of  these  earlysixties  sit  coms  of  which you speak These creatures you callmice you see they are not quite as they appear They are merelythe  protrusion  into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pandimensional beings The whole business with the  cheese  and  thesqueaking is just a frontThe old man paused and with a sympathetic frown continuedTheyve been experimenting on you Im afraidArthur thought about  this  for  a  second  and  then  his  faceclearedAh no he said I see the source of the misunderstanding  nowNo  look  you  see  what  happened  was  that  we  used  to  doexperiments  on  them  They  were  often  used  in   behaviouralresearch Pavlov and all that sort of stuff So what happened washat the mice would be set all sorts of tests  learning  to  ringbells  run  around  mazes and things so that the whole nature ofthe learning process could be examined From our observations  oftheir  behaviour  we were able to learn all sorts of things aboutour own Arthurs voice tailed offSuch subtlety  said Slartibartfast one has to admire itWhat said ArthurHow better to disguise their real natures  and  how  better  toguide  your thinking Suddenly running down a maze the wrong wayeating the wrong bit of cheese unexpectedly   dropping  dead  ofmyxomatosis  if its finely calculated the cumulative effect isenormousHe paused for effectYou  see  Earthman  they  really   are   particularly   cleverhyperintelligent  pandimensional  beings Your planet and peoplehave formed the matrix of an  organic  computer  running  a  tenmillionyear research programme Let me tell you the whole story Itll take a little timeTime  said  Arthur  weakly  is  not  currently  one  of   myproblemsThere are of course many problems connected with life  of  whichsome  of  the  most  popular are Why are people born Why do theydie Why do they want to spend so much of  the  intervening  timewearing digital watchesMany many millions of years ago a race of  hyperintelligent  pandimensional  beings  whose  physical  manifestation in their ownpandimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own got so fedup  with  the  constant bickering about the meaning of life whichused to interrupt  their  favourite  pastime  of  Brockian  UltraCricket  a  curious  game which involved suddenly hitting peoplefor no readily apparent reason and then running away  that  theydecided to sit down and solve their problems once and for allAnd to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computerwhich  was  so  amazingly  intelligent  that even before the databanks had been connected up it had started from I think thereforeI  am  and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and incometax before anyone managed to turn it offIt was the size of a small cityIts main console was installed in a specially designed  executiveoffice   mounted   on  an  enormous  executive  desk  of  finestultramahagony  topped  with  rich  ultrared  leather  The   darkcarpeting   was  discreetly  sumptuous  exotic  pot  plants  andtastefully engraved prints of the principal computer  programmersand  their  families  were deployed liberally about the room andstately windows looked out upon a treelined public squareOn  the  day  of  the  Great  OnTurning  two   soberly   dressedprogrammers  with  brief  cases arrived and were shown discreetlyinto the office  They  were  aware  that  this  day  they  wouldrepresent  their  entire  race  in  its greatest moment but theyconducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselvesdeferentially  before the desk opened their brief cases and tookout their leatherbound notebooksTheir names were Lunkwill and FookFor a few moments they sat in  respectful  silence  then  afterexchanging  a quiet glance with Fook Lunkwill leaned forward andtouched a small black panelThe subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was  nowin  total  active mode After a pause it spoke to them in a voicerich resonant and deepIt said What is this great task for which I Deep Thought  thesecond  greatest  computer in the Universe of Time and Space havebeen called into existenceLunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise Your task O Computer  began FookNo wait a minute this isnt right  said  Lunkwill  worriedWe distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one everand were not making do  with  second  best  Deep  Thought  headdressed  the  computer  are you not as we designed you to bethe greatest most powerful computer in all timeI  described  myself  as  the  second  greatest  intoned  DeepThought and such I amAnother worried look passed between the two programmers Lunkwillcleared his throatThere must be some mistake he said are you  not  a  greatestcomputer  than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all theatoms in a star in a millisecondThe Milliard Gargantubrain said Deep Thought with  unconcealedcontempt A mere abacus  mention it notAnd are you  not  said  Fook  leaning  anxiously  forward  agreater  analyst  than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the SeventhGalaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the  trajectoryof  every  single  dust particle throughout a fiveweek DangrabadBeta sand blizzardA fiveweek sand blizzard said Deep  Thought  haughtily  Youask  this  of  me  who  have contemplated the very vectors of theatoms in the Big Bang itself Molest  me  not  with  this  pocketcalculator stuffThe two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence  for  a  momentThen Lunkwill leaned forward againBut are you not he said a more fiendish disputant  than  theGreat Hyperlobic OmniCognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus the Magic and IndefatigableThe Great Hyperlobic OmniCognate Neutron Wrangler  said  DeepThought thoroughly rolling the rs could talk all four legs offan Arcturan MegaDonkey  but only I could persuade it to go for awalk afterwardsThen what asked Fook is the problemThere is no problem said Deep Thought with magnificent ringingtones  I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universeof Space and TimeBut the second insisted Lunkwill Why do you keep saying  thesecond   Youre   surely  not  thinking  of  the  MulticorticoidPerspicutron Titan Muller are you Or  the  Pondermatic  Or  theContemptuous lights flashed across the computers consoleI spare not  a  single  unit  of  thought  on  these  cyberneticsimpletons he boomed I speak of none but the computer that isto come after meFook was losing  patience  He  pushed  his  notebook  aside  andmuttered I think this is getting needlessly messianicYou know nothing of future time pronounced Deep Thought  andyet  in  my  teeming  circuitry I can navigate the infinite deltastreams of future probability and see that  there  must  one  daycome  a  computer  whose  merest  operational parameters I am notworthy to calculate but which it will be my fate  eventually  todesignFook sighed heavily and glanced across to LunkwillCan we get on and ask the question he saidLunkwill motioned him to waitWhat computer is this of which you speak he askedI will speak of it no further in this present time  said  DeepThought  Now Ask what else of me you will that I may functionSpeakThey shrugged at each other Fook composed himselfO Deep Thought Computer he said the task  we  have  designedyou  to  perform  is this We want you to tell us  he paused the AnswerThe answer said Deep Thought The answer to whatLife urged FookThe Universe said LunkwillEverything they said in chorusDeep Thought paused for a moments reflectionTricky he said finallyBut can you do itAgain a significant pauseYes said Deep Thought I can do itThere is an answer said Fook with breathless excitementA simple answer added LunkwillYes said Deep Thought Life the  Universe  and  EverythingThere  is  an  answer  But he added Ill have to think aboutitA sudden commotion destroyed the moment the door flew  open  andtwo  angry  men  wearing the coarse fadedblue robes and belts ofthe Cruxwan University burst into the room thrusting  aside  theineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their wayWe demand  admission  shouted  the  younger  of  the  two  menelbowing a pretty young secretary in the throatCome on shouted the older one you cant  keep  us  out  Hepushed a junior programmer back through the doorWe demand that you cant keep us out bawled the  younger  onethough  he was now firmly inside the room and no further attemptswere being made to stop himWho are you said Lunkwill rising angrily from his seat Whatdo you wantI am Majikthise announced the older oneAnd I demand that I am Vroomfondel shouted the younger oneMajikthise turned on Vroomfondel Its  alright  he  explainedangrily you dont need to demand thatAlright bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby  desk  I  amVroomfondel and that is not a demand that is a solid fact Whatwe demand is solid factsNo we dont  exclaimed  Majikthise  in  irritation  That  isprecisely what we dont demandScarcely pausing  for  breath  Vroomfondel  shouted  We  dontdemand  solid  facts  What we demand is a total absence of solidfacts I demand that I may or may not be VroomfondelBut who the devil are you exclaimed an outraged FookWe said Majikthise are PhilosophersThough we may not be said Vroomfondel waving a warning  fingerat the programmersYes we are insisted Majikthise We are quite definitely  hereas  representatives  of  the  Amalgamated  Union of PhilosophersSages Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons and  we  want  thismachine off and we want it off nowWhats the problem said LunkwillIll tell you  what  the  problem  is  mate  said  Majikthisedemarcation thats the problemWe demand yelled Vroomfondel that demarcation may or may notbe the problemYou just let the machines get on with  the  adding  up  warnedMajikthise  and  well  take care of the eternal verities thankyou very much You want to check your legal position you do mateUnder  law  the  Quest  for  Ultimate  Truth is quite clearly theinalienable  prerogative of your  working  thinkers  Any  bloodymachine  goes  and  actually finds it and were straight out of ajob arent we I mean whats the use of our sitting up  half  thenight  arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machineonly goes and  gives  us  his  bleeding  phone  number  the  nextmorningThats right shouted Vroomfondel we demand  rigidly  definedareas of doubt and uncertaintySuddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the roomMight I make  an  observation  at  this  point  inquired  DeepThoughtWell go on strike yelled VroomfondelThats  right  agreed  Majikthise  Youll  have  a  nationalPhilosophers strike on your handsThe hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillarybass  driver  units  mounted  in  sedately  carved and varnishedcabinet speakers around the room cut in to give  Deep  Thoughtsvoice a little more powerAll I wanted  to  say  bellowed  the  computer  is  that  mycircuits  are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answerto the Ultimate Question of Life the Universe and Everything he  paused  and  satisfied  himself  that  he  now had everyonesattention before continuing more  quietly  but  the  programmewill take me a little while to runFook glanced impatiently at his watchHow long he saidSeven and a half million years said Deep ThoughtLunkwill and Fook blinked at each otherSeven and a half million years  they cried in chorusYes declaimed Deep Thought I said Id have  to  think  aboutit  didnt  I And it occurs to me that running a programme likethis is bound to create an enormous amount of  popular  publicityfor  the whole area of philosophy in general Everyones going tohave their own theories about what answer Im eventually to  comeup  with  and who better to capitalize on that media market thanyou yourself So long as you can keep disagreeing with each otherviolently  enough  and  slagging  each  other  off in the popularpress you can keep yourself on the gravy  train  for  life  Howdoes that soundThe two philosophers gaped at himBloody  hell  said  Majikthise  now  that  is  what  I  callthinking  Here Vroomfondel why do we never think of things likethatDunno said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper think  our  brainsmust be too highly trained MajikthiseSo saying they turned on their heels and walked out of the  doorand into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreamsYes very  salutary  said  Arthur  after  Slartibartfast  hadrelated  the  salient  points  of  the story to him but I dontunderstand what all this has got to do with the  Earth  and  miceand thingsThat is but the first half of the story Earthman said the  oldman  If  you  would  care to discover what happened seven and ahalf millions later on the great day of the Answer allow me  toinvite  you  to  my  study  where  you  can experience the eventsyourself on our SensOTape records That  is  unless  you  wouldcare  to  take  a  quick stroll on the surface of New Earth Itsonly half completed Im afraid  we havent even finished buryingthe  artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet then we havethe Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era  to  laydown and No thank you said Arthur it wouldnt be quite the sameNo said Slartibartfast it  wont  be  and  he  turned  theaircar round and headed back towards the mindnumbing wallSlartibartfasts study was a total mess like the results  of  anexplosion  in  a  public  library  The  old  man frowned as theystepped inTerribly unfortunate he said a diode  blew  in  one  of  thelifesupport  computers  When  we  tried  to revive our cleaningstaff we discovered theyd been dead for nearly  thirty  thousandyears  Whos  going to clear away the bodies thats what I wantto know Look why dont you sit yourself down over there and  letme plug you inHe gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had beenmade out of the rib cage of a stegosaurusIt was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus explained theold  man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from undertottering piles of paper  and  drawing  instruments  Here  hesaid  hold  these and passed a couple of stripped wire end toArthurThe instant he took hold of them a  bird  flew  straight  throughhimHe was suspended in midair and  totally  invisible  to  himselfBeneath him was a pretty treelined city square and all around itas far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airyspacious  design  but  somewhat  the  worse  for wear  many werecracked and stained with rain Today however the sun was shininga  fresh  breeze  danced  lightly  through the trees and the oddsensation  that  all  the  buildings  were  quietly  humming  wasprobably  caused  by the fact that the square and all the streetsaround it were thronged with cheerful excited people Somewhere aband  was playing brightly coloured flags were fluttering in thebreeze and the spirit of carnival was in the airArthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air  above  itall without so much as a body to his name but before he had timeto reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and  calledfor everyones attentionA man standing on a brightly dressed  dais  before  the  buildingwhich  clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd overa TannoyO people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought he  cried  outHonoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise the Greatestand Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe  has  ever  known The Time of Waiting is overWild cheers broke out amongst the  crowd  Flags  streamers  andwolf whistles sailed through the air The narrower streets lookedrather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and franticallywaving their legs in the airSeven and a half million years our  race  has  waited  for  thisGreat  and  Hopefully  Enlightening Day cried the cheer leaderThe Day of the AnswerHurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowdNever again cried the man never again will we wake up in themorning  and  think Who am I What is my purpose in life Does itreally cosmically speaking matter if I dont get up and  go  towork  For today we will finally learn once and for all the plainand simple answer to all these nagging little problems  of  Lifethe Universe and EverythingAs the crowd erupted once again  Arthur  found  himself  glidingthrough the air and down towards one of the large stately windowson the first floor of the building behind the dais from which thespeaker was addressing the crowdHe experienced a moments panic as  he  sailed  straight  throughtowards  the  window  which  passed when a second or so later hefound  he  had  gone  right  through  the  solid  glass   withoutapparently touching itNo one in the room remarked on his  peculiar  arrival  which  ishardly  surprising  as  he wasnt there He began to realize thatthe whole experience  was  merely  a  recorded  projection  whichknocked sixtrack seventymillimetre into a cocked hatThe room was much as Slartibartfast had described  it  In  sevenand  a  half  million  years  it  had  been well looked after andcleaned regularly every century or so The ultramahagony desk wasworn  at  the edges the carpet a little faded now but the largecomputer terminal sat in sparkling glory on  the  desks  leathertop as bright as if it had been constructed yesterdayTwo severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal andwaitedThe time is nearly upon us said one and Arthur was  surprisedto  see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the mansneck The word was Loonquawl and it flashed a  couple  of  timesand  the  disappeared again Before Arthur was able to assimilatethis the other man spoke and the word  Phouchg  appeared  by  hisneckSeventyfive thousand generations ago our  ancestors  set  thisprogram in motion the second man said and in all that time wewill be the first to hear the computer speakAn awesome prospect Phouchg agreed the first man and  Arthursuddenly   realized   that  he  was  watching  a  recording  withsubtitlesWe are the ones who will hear said Phouchg the answer to thegreat question of Life The Universe  said LoonquawlAnd Everything Shhh said Loonquawl with  a  slight  gesture  I  think  DeepThought is preparing to speakThere was a moments expectant pause whilst panels slowly came tolife  on  the  front  of  the  console Lights flashed on and offexperimentally and settled down into a  businesslike  pattern  Asoft low hum came from the communication channelGood morning said Deep Thought at lastEr  Good morning O Deep Thought said Loonquawl  nervouslydo you have  er that is An answer for you interrupted Deep Thought majestically YesI haveThe two men shivered with expectancy Their waiting had not  beenin vainThere really is one breathed PhouchgThere really is one confirmed Deep ThoughtTo Everything To the great Question of Life the  Universe  andEverythingYesBoth of the men had been trained for this moment their lives hadbeen  a  preparation  for  it they had been selected at birth asthose who would witness  the  answer  but  even  so  they  foundthemselves gasping and squirming like excited childrenAnd youre ready to give it to us urged LoonquawlI amNowNow said Deep ThoughtThey both licked their dry lipsThough I dont think added Deep Thought that youre going tolike itDoesnt matter said Phouchg We must know it NowNow inquired Deep ThoughtYes Now Alright said the computer and settled into silence again  Thetwo men fidgeted The tension was unbearableYoure really not going to like it observed Deep ThoughtTell usAlright said Deep Thought The Answer to the  Great  QuestionYes Of Life the Universe and Everything  said Deep ThoughtYes Is  said Deep Thought and pausedYes Is Yes Fortytwo said Deep Thought with infinite majesty and calmIt was a long time before anyone spokeOut of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea  of  tenseexpectant faces down in the square outsideWere going to get lynched arent we he whisperedIt was a tough assignment said Deep Thought mildlyFortytwo yelled Loonquawl Is that all youve  got  to  showfor seven and a half million years workI checked it very thoroughly  said  the  computer  and  thatquite  definitely is the answer I think the problem to be quitehonest with you is that youve never  actually  known  what  thequestion isBut it was the Great Question The Ultimate  Question  of  Lifethe Universe and Everything howled LoonquawlYes said Deep Thought with the air of one  who  suffers  foolsgladly but what actually is itA slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at thecomputer and then at each otherWell you know its just Everything  Everything  offeredPhouchg weaklyExactly said Deep Thought So  once  you  do  know  what  thequestion actually is youll know what the answer meansOh terrific muttered Phouchg flinging aside his  notebook  andwiping away a tiny tearLook alright alright said Loonquawl can  you  just  pleasetell us the QuestionThe Ultimate QuestionYesOf Life the Universe and EverythingYesDeep Thought pondered this for a momentTricky he saidBut can you do it cried LoonquawlDeep Thought pondered this for another long momentFinally No he said firmlyBoth men collapsed on to their chairs in despairBut Ill tell you who can said Deep ThoughtThey both looked up sharplyWho Tell usSuddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently  nonexistent  scalpbegin  to  crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorablyforward towards the console but it was only a dramatic  zoom  onthe part of whoever had made the recording he assumedI speak of none other than the computer that is  to  come  afterme  intoned  Deep  Thought  his voice regaining its accustomeddeclamatory  tones  A   computer   whose   merest   operationalparameters  I  am not worthy to calculate  and yet I will designit for you A computer which can calculate the  Question  to  theUltimate   Answer   a  computer  of  such  infinite  and  subtlecomplexity that organic  life  itself  shall  form  part  of  itsoperational  matrix  And  you yourselves shall take on new formsand go down into the computer to  navigate  its  tenmillionyearprogram  Yes  I shall design this computer for you And I shallname it also unto you And it shall be called  The EarthPhouchg gaped at Deep ThoughtWhat a dull name he said and great incisions appeared down thelength  of  his  body  Loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrificgashed from nowhere The Computer console blotched  and  crackedthe  walls  flickered  and  crumbled and the room crashed upwardsinto its own ceiling Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur  holding  the  twowiresEnd of the tape he explainedZaphod Wake upMmmmmwwwwwerrrrrHey come on wake upJust let me stick to what Im good at  yeah  muttered  Zaphodand rolled away from the voice back to sleepDo you want me to kick you said FordWould it give you a lot of pleasure said Zaphod blearilyNoNor me So whats the point Stop  bugging  me  Zaphod  curledhimself upHe got a double dose of the gas said Trillian looking down  athim two windpipesAnd stop talking said Zaphod  its  hard  enough  trying  tosleep  anyway  Whats  the matter with the ground Its all coldand hardIts gold said FordWith an amazingly  balletic  movement  Zaphod  was  standing  andscanning  the  horizon  because that was how far the gold groundstretched in every direction  perfectly  smooth  and  solid  Itgleamed  like    its  impossible  to say what it gleamed likebecause nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way thata planet of solid gold doesWho put all that there yelped Zaphod goggleeyedDont get excited said Ford its only a catalogueA whoA catalogue said Trillian an illusionHow can you say that cried Zaphod falling to  his  hands  andknees  and staring at the ground He poked it and prodded it withhis fingernail It was very heavy and very  slightly  soft    hecould  mark  it  with his fingernail It was very yellow and veryshiny and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it inthat  very  peculiar  and  special way that breath evaporates offsolid goldTrillian and I came round a while ago said Ford  We  shoutedand  yelled  till  somebody came and then carried on shouting andyelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogueto keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us This is allSensOTapeZaphod stared at him bitterlyAh shit he said you wake me up from my own  perfectly  gooddream to show me somebody elses He sat down in a huffWhats that series of valleys over there he saidHallmark said Ford We had a lookWe didnt wake you earlier said Trillian The last planet wasknee deep in fishFishSome people like the oddest thingsAnd before that said Ford we  had  platinum  Bit  dull  Wethought youd like to see this one thoughSeas of light glared at them in one  solid  blaze  wherever  theylookedVery pretty said Zaphod petulantlyIn the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared  It  flickeredand changed and when they looked around again so had the landAs with one voice they all went YuchThe sea was purple The beach they were on was composed  of  tinyyellow  and  green pebbles  presumably terribly precious stonesThe mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with redpeaks  Nearby  stood  a  solid  silver beach table with a frillymauve parasol and silver tasslesIn the sky a huge sign appeared replacing the catalogue  numberIt  said  Whatever  your tastes Magrathea can cater for you Weare not proudAnd five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the  sky  onparachutesIn a moment the scene vanished and  left  them  in  a  springtimemeadow full of cowsOw said Zaphod My brainsYou want to talk about it said FordYeah OK said Zaphod and all three sat down and  ignored  thescenes that came and went around themI figure this said Zaphod Whatever happened to  my  mind  Idid  it  And I did it in such a way that it wouldnt be detectedby the government screening tests And I wasnt to know  anythingabout it myself Pretty crazy rightThe other two nodded in agreementSo I reckon whats so secret that I cant let  anybody  know  Iknow  it  not  the Galactic Government not even myself And theanswer is I dont  know  Obviously  But  I  put  a  few  thingstogether  and  I can begin to guess When did I decide to run forPresident Shortly after the death of President Yooden Vranx Youremember Yooden FordYeah said Ford he was that guy we met when we were kids theArcturan  captain He was a gas He gave us conkers when you bustyour way into his megafreighter Said you were the  most  amazingkid hed ever metWhats all this said TrillianAncient history said Ford when  we  were  kids  together  onBetelgeuse The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of thebulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying  regionsThe  Betelgeuse  trading  scouts used to find the markets and theArcturans would supply them There was  a  lot  of  trouble  withspace  pirates  before they were wiped out in the Dordellis warsand the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantasticdefence  shields known to Galactic science They were real brutesof ships and huge In orbit round a planet  they  would  eclipsethe sunOne day young Zaphod here decides to raid  one  On  a  trijetscooter designed for stratosphere work a mere kid I mean forgetit it was crazier than a mad monkey I went along for  the  ridebecause  Id  got  some  very safe money on him not doing it anddidnt want him coming back with fake evidence So what  happensWe  got  in  his  trijet  which  he had souped up into somethingtotally other crossed three parsecs in a matter of  weeks  bustour  way  into a megafreighter I still dont know how marched onto the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers  A  wilderthing  I have not known Lost me a years pocket money For whatConkersThe captain was this really amazing  guy  Yooden  Vranx  saidZaphod  He  gave us food booze  stuff from really weird partsof the Galaxy  lots of conkers of course and we  had  just  themost  incredible  time  Then  he  teleported  us  back Into themaximum security wing of Betelgeuse state prison He was  a  coolguy Went on to become President of the GalaxyZaphod pausedThe scene around them was  currently  plunged  into  gloom  Darkmists   swirled   round   them   and  elephantine  shapes  lurkedindistinctly in the shadows The air was occasionally  rent  withthe  sounds  of  illusory beings murdering other illusory beingsPresumably enough people must have liked this sort  of  thing  tomake it a paying propositionFord said Zaphod quietlyYeahJust before Yooden died he came to see meWhat You never told meNoWhat did he say What did he come to see you aboutHe told me about the Heart of Gold  It  was  his  idea  that  Ishould steal itHis ideaYeah said Zaphod and the only possible way  of  stealing  itwas to be at the launching ceremonyFord gaped at him in astonishment for a moment and  then  roaredwith laughterAre you telling me he said  that  you  set  yourself  up  tobecome President of the Galaxy just to steal that shipThats it said Zaphod with the sort of  grin  that  would  getmost people locked away in a room with soft wallsBut why said Ford Whats so important about having itDunno said Zaphod I think if Id consciously known what  wasso  important about it and what I would need it for it would haveshowed up on the brain screening tests and  I  would  never  havepassed  I  think  Yooden  told me a lot of things that are stilllocked awaySo you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain  asa result of Yooden talking to youHe was a hell of a talkerYeah but Zaphod old mate you want to look after  yourself  youknowZaphod shruggedI mean dont you have any inkling of the reasons for all thisasked FordZaphod thought hard about this and doubts  seemed  to  cross  hismindsNo he said at last I dont seem to be  letting  myself  intoany of my secrets Still he added on further reflection I canunderstand that I wouldnt trust myself  further  than  I  couldspit a ratA moment later the last planet in the  catalogue  vanished  frombeneath them and the solid world resolved itself againThey were sitting in a  plush  waiting  room  full  of  glasstoptables and design awardsA tall Magrathean man was standing in front of themThe mice will see you now he saidSo there you have it said Slartibartfast making a feeble  andperfunctory  attempt  to clear away some of the appalling mess ofhis study He picked up a paper from the top of a pile but  thencouldnt  think  of anywhere else to put it so he but it back ontop of the original pile which promptly fell over Deep  Thoughtdesigned the Earth we built it and you lived on itAnd the Vogons came and destroyed it  five  minutes  before  theprogram was completed added Arthur not unbitterlyYes said the old man pausing to  gaze  hopelessly  round  theroom  Ten  million  years  of  planning and work gone just likethat Ten million years Earthman  can you  conceive  of  thatkind  of  time  span  A  galactic civilization could grow from asingle worm five times over in that time Gone He pausedWell thats bureaucracy for you he addedYou know said Arthur thoughtfully all this explains a lot ofthings  All  through my life Ive had this strange unaccountablefeeling that something was going on in the world something  bigeven sinister and no one would tell me what it wasNo said the old man thats just perfectly  normal  paranoiaEveryone in the Universe has thatEveryone said Arthur Well if everyone has that  perhaps  itmeans  something  Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we knowMaybe Who cares said Slartibartfast  before  Arthur  got  tooexcited Perhaps Im old and tired he continued but I alwaysthink that the chances of finding out what really is going on areso  absurdly  remote that the only thing to do is to say hang thesense of it and just keep yourself occupied Look at me I designcoastlines I got an award for NorwayHe rummaged around in a pile of debris and  pulled  out  a  largeperspex  block  with his name on it and a model of Norway mouldedinto itWheres the sense in that he said None that Ive  been  ableto  make  out  Ive  been  doing  fjords  in  all my life For afleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major awardHe turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed  it  asidecarelessly  but  not  so  carelessly  that  it  didnt  land  onsomething softIn this replacement Earth were building theyve given me Africato  do and of course Im doing it with all fjords again because Ihappen to like them and Im old fashioned enough to  think  thatthey  give a lovely baroque feel to a continent And they tell meits not equatorial enough Equatorial He gave a hollow  laughWhat  does it matter Science has achieved some wonderful thingsof course but Id far rather be happy than right any dayAnd are youNo Thats where it all falls down of coursePity said Arthur with sympathy It sounded like quite a  goodlifestyle otherwiseSomewhere on the wall a small white light flashedCome said Slartibartfast you are  to  meet  the  mice  Yourarrival  on the planet has caused considerable excitement It hasalready been hailed so I gather as the  third  most  improbableevent in the history of the UniverseWhat were the first twoOh probably just coincidences said Slartibartfast carelesslyHe opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to followArthur glanced around him once more and then down at himself atthe sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in onThursday morningI seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle hemuttered to himselfI beg your pardon said the old man mildlyOh nothing said Arthur only jokingIt is of course well known that careless talk  costs  lives  butthe full scale of the problem is not always appreciatedFor instance at the very moment that Arthur said I seem  to  behaving tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle a freak wormholeopened up in the fabric of the spacetime continuum  and  carriedhis  words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches ofspace to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike  beings  werepoised on the brink of frightful interstellar battleThe two opposing leaders were meeting for the last timeA dreadful silence  fell  across  the  conference  table  as  thecommander  of  the  Vlhurgs  resplendent  in his black jewelledbattle shorts gazed levelly at the GGugvuntt  leader  squattingopposite  him in a cloud of green sweetsmelling steam and witha million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers  poised  tounleash  electric death at his single word of command challengedthe vile creature to take back what it had said about his motherThe creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour and  at  thatvery  moment  the words I seem to be having tremendous difficultywith my lifestyle drifted across the conference tableUnfortunately in the Vlhurg tongue this was the  most  dreadfulinsult  imaginable  and  there  was  nothing  for it but to wageterrible war for centuriesEventually of course after their Galaxy had been decimated  overa  few  thousand  years it was realized that the whole thing hadbeen a ghastly mistake and so the  two  opposing  battle  fleetssettled  their  few  remaining  differences  in order to launch ajoint attack on our own Galaxy  now positively identified as thesource of the offending remarkFor thousands more years the mighty ships tore across  the  emptywastes  of  space  and  finally  dived  screaming on to the firstplanet they came across  which happened to be the Earth   wheredue to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleetwas accidentally swallowed by a small dogThose who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in  thehistory  of  the Universe say that this sort of thing is going onall the time but that we are powerless to prevent itIts just life they sayA short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old  Magrathean  to  adoorway  They  left  the  car  and  went through the door into awaiting room full of  glasstopped  tables  and  perspex  awardsAlmost  immediately  a light flashed above the door at the otherside of the room and they enteredArthur Youre safe a voice criedAm I said Arthur rather startled Oh goodThe lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so tosee  Ford  Trillian  and  Zaphod  sitting  round  a  large tablebeautifully decked out with exotic dishes strange sweetmeats andbizarre fruits They were stuffing their facesWhat happened to you demanded ArthurWell said Zaphod attacking a boneful of grilled muscle  ourguests  here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and beinggenerally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to  makeit  up  to us Here he said hoiking out a lump of evil smellingmeat from a bowl have some Vegan Rhinos cutlet Its deliciousif you happen to like that sort of thingHosts said Arthur What hosts I dont see any A small voice said Welcome to lunch Earth creatureArthur glanced around and suddenly yelpedUgh he said There are mice on the tableThere was an awkward silence  as  everyone  looked  pointedly  atArthurHe was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked likewhisky  glasses  on  the  table He heard the silence and glancedaround at everyoneOh he said with sudden realization Oh Im sorry I  wasntquite prepared for Let me introduce you said  Trillian  Arthur  this  is  BenjimouseHi said one of the mice His whiskers stroked what  must  havebeen  a  touch  sensitive panel on the inside of the whiskyglasslike affair and it moved forward slightlyAnd this is Frankie mouseThe other mouse said Pleased to meet you and did likewiseArthur gapedBut arent they Yes said Trillian they are the mice I brought with  me  fromthe EarthShe looked him in the eye and  Arthur  thought  he  detected  thetiniest resigned shrugCould you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey  shesaidSlartibartfast coughed politelyEr excuse me he saidYes thank you Slartibartfast said Benji mouse  sharply  youmay goWhat Oh  er very well said the old  man  slightly  takenaback Ill just go and get on with some of my fjords thenAh well in fact that wont be necessary said  Frankie  mouseIt  looks  very much as if we wont be needing the new Earth anylonger He swivelled his pink little eyes Not now that we havefound  a native of the planet who was there seconds before it wasdestroyedWhat cried Slartibartfast aghast You cant mean that  Ivegot a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over AfricaWell perhaps you can take a  quick  skiing  holiday  before  youdismantle them said Frankie acidlySkiing holiday cried the old man Those glaciers are works ofart  Elegantly  sculptured  contours  soaring pinnacles of icedeep majestic ravines It would be sacrilege to go skiing on highartThank you Slartibartfast said  Benji  firmly  That  will  beallYes sir said the old man coldly thank you very  much  Wellgoodbye  Earthman  he said to Arthur hope the lifestyle comestogetherWith a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and  walkedsadly out of the roomArthur stared after him not knowing what to sayNow said Benji mouse to businessFord and Zaphod clinked their glasses togetherTo business they saidI beg your pardon said BenjiFord looked roundSorry I thought you were proposing a toast he saidThe  two  mice  scuttled  impatiently  around  in   their   glasstransports  Finally  they  composed  themselves and Benji movedforward to address ArthurNow Earth creature he said the situation we have in  effectis  this  We  have  as you know been more or less running yourplanet for the last ten million  years  in  order  to  find  thiswretched thing called the Ultimate QuestionWhy said Arthur sharplyNo  we already thought of that one said Frankie interruptingbut  it doesnt fit the answer Why  FortyTwo  you see itdoesnt workNo said Arthur I mean why have you been doing itOh I see said Frankie Well eventually just habit I  thinkto be brutally honest And this is more or less the point  weresick to the teeth with the whole thing and the prospect of doingit all over again on account of those whinnetridden Vogons quitefrankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies  you  know  what  Imean It was by the merest lucky chance that Benji and I finishedour particular job and left the planet early for a quick holidayand  have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the goodoffices of your friendsMagrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension put in BenjiSince when continued his murine colleague  we  have  had  anoffer  of  a quite enormously fat contract to do the D chat showand lecture circuit back in  our  own  dimensional  neck  of  thewoods and were very much inclined to take itI would wouldnt you Ford said Zaphod promptinglyOh yes said Ford jump at it like a shotArthur glanced at them wondering what all this  was  leading  uptoBut weve got to have a product you see said Frankie I  meanideally  we  still  need  the  Ultimate  Question in some form orotherZaphod leaned forward to ArthurYou see he said if theyre just sitting there in the  studiolooking  very  relaxed  and  you know just mentioning that theyhappen to know the Answer to Life the Universe  and  Everythingand  then  eventually  have to admit that in fact its Fortytwothen the shows probably quite short No followup you seeWe have to have something that sounds good said BenjiSomething that sounds  good  exclaimed  Arthur  An  UltimateQuestion that sounds good From a couple of miceThe mice bristledWell I mean yes idealism yes the dignity  of  pure  researchyes  the  pursuit  of  truth  in all its forms but there comes apoint Im afraid where you begin to suspect that if  theres  anyreal  truth  its  that the entire multidimensional infinity ofthe Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacsAnd  if  it  comes  to  a choice between spending yet another tenmillion years finding that out and on the other hand just takingthe  money  and  running  then  I  for  one  could  do  with theexercise said FrankieBut  started Arthur hopelesslyHey will you get this Earthman interrupted Zaphod You  area last generation product of that computer matrix right and youwere there right up to the moment your  planet  got  the  fingeryeahEr So  your  brain  was  an  organic  part   of   the   penultimateconfiguration  of  the  computer  programme  said  Ford ratherlucidly he thoughtRight said ZaphodWell said Arthur doubtfully He wasnt aware  of  ever  havingfelt  an organic part of anything He had always seen this as oneof his problemsIn other words said Benji steering his curious little vehicleright  over  to Arthur theres a good chance that the structureof the question is encoded in the structure of your brain  so wewant to buy it off youWhat the question said ArthurYes said Ford and TrillianFor lots of money said ZaphodNo no said Frankie its the brain we want to buyWhatI  thought  you   said   you   could   just   read   his   brainelectronically protested FordOh yes said Frankie but wed have to get it out first  Itsgot to be preparedTreated said BenjiDicedThank you shouted Arthur tipping up  his  chair  and  backingaway from the table in horrorIt could always be replaced said  Benji  reasonably  if  youthink its importantYes an electronic brain said Frankie  a  simple  one  wouldsufficeA simple one wailed ArthurYeah said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin youd just have  toprogram  it  to  say What and I dont understand and Wheres thetea  whod know the differenceWhat cried Arthur backing away still furtherSee what I mean said Zaphod and howled with  pain  because  ofsomething that Trillian did at that momentId notice the difference said ArthurNo you wouldnt said Frankie mouse youd be  programmed  nottoFord made for the doorLook Im sorry mice old lads he said I dont  think  wevegot a dealI rather think we have to have a deal said the mice in chorusall  the  charm  vanishing  fro  their piping little voices in aninstant With a tiny whining shriek their  two  glass  transportslifted  themselves  off  the  table  and  swung  through the airtowards Arthur who  stumbled  further  backwards  into  a  blindcorner utterly unable to cope or think of anythingTrillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag himtowards  the door which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to openbut Arthur was dead weight  he seemed hypnotized by the airbornerodents swooping towards himShe screamed at him but he just gapedWith one more yank Ford and Zaphod got the  door  open  On  theother  side  of  it  was a small pack of rather ugly men who theycould only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea Not only  werethey ugly themselves but the medical equipment they carried withthem was also far from pretty They chargedSo  Arthur was about to have his head  cut  open  Trillian  wasunable to help him and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set uponby several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed thanthey wereAll in all it was extremely fortunate that at that  moment  everyalarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting dinEmergency Emergency blared the klaxons throughout  MagratheaHostile  ship  has  landed on planet Armed intruders in sectionA Defence stations defence stationsThe two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glasstransports where they lay shattered on the floorDamnation muttered Frankie mouse  all  that  fuss  over  twopounds of Earthling brain He scuttled round and about his pinkeyes flashing his fine white coat bristling with staticThe only thing  we  can  do  now  said  Benji  crouching  andstroking his whiskers in thought is to try and fake a questioninvent one that will sound plausibleDifficult said Frankie He thought How about  Whats  yellowand dangerousBenji considered this for a momentNo no good he said Doesnt fit the answerThey sank into silence for a few secondsAlright said Benji What do you get if you  multiply  six  bysevenNo no too  literal  too  factual  said  Frankie  wouldntsustain the punters interestAgain they thoughtThen Frankie said Heres a thought How many roads must  a  manwalk downAh said Benji Aha now that does sound promising He rolledthe  phrase  around  a little Yes he said thats excellentSounds very  significant  without  actually  tying  you  down  tomeaning  anything  at  all  How many roads must a man walk downFortytwo Excellent excellent thatll fox em  Frankie  babywe are madeThey performed a scampering dance in their excitementNear them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who  had  beenhit about the head with some heavy design awardsHalf a mile away four figures pounded up a corridor looking  fora  way out They emerged into a wide openplan computer bay Theyglanced about wildlyWhich way do you reckon Zaphod said FordAt a wild guess Id say down here said  Zaphod  running  offdown  to  the  right between a computer bank and the wall As theothers started after him he was brought up short by a  KillOZapenergy  bolt  that cracked through the air inches in front of himand fried a small section of adjacent wallA voice on a loud hailer said  OK  Beeblebrox  hold  it  rightthere Weve got you coveredCops hissed Zaphod and span around in a crouch You want  totry a guess at all FordOK this way said Ford and  the  four  of  them  ran  down  agangway between two computer banksAt the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and  spacesuited figure waving a vicious KillOZap gunWe dont want to shoot you Beeblebrox shouted the figureSuits me fine shouted Zaphod back and dived down  a  wide  gapbetween two data process unitsThe others swerved in behind himThere are two of them said Trillian Were corneredThey squeezed  themselves  down  in  an  angle  between  a  largecomputer data bank and the wallThey held their breath and waitedSuddenly the air exploded with energy  bolts  as  both  the  copsopened fire on them simultaneouslyHey theyre shooting at us said Arthur crouching in a  tightball I thought they said they didnt want to do thatYeah I thought they said that agreed FordZaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous momentHey he said I thought you said you didnt want to shoot usand ducked againThey waitedAfter a moment a voice replied It isnt easy being a copWhat did he say whispered Ford in astonishmentHe said it isnt easy being a copWell surely thats his problem isnt itId have thought soFord shouted out Hey listen I think weve got enough  problemson  our  own  having  you  shooting  at us so if you could avoidlaying your problems on us as well I  think  wed  all  find  iteasier to copeAnother pause and then the loud hailer againNow see here guy said the voice on the loud  hailer  yourenot dealing with any dumb twobit triggerpumping morons with lowhairlines little piggy eyes and no conversation were a  coupleof  intelligent caring guys that youd probably quite like if youmet us socially I dont go around gratuitously  shooting  peopleand  then  bragging  about  it  afterwards in seedy spacerangersbars like some cops I could mention I go around shooting peoplegratuitously  and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours tomy girlfriendAnd I write novels chimed in the other cop Though I  haventhad  any  of  them  published yet so I better warn you Im in ameeeean moodFords eyes popped halfway out of their sockets Who  are  theseguys he saidDunno said Zaphod I think I  preferred  it  when  they  wereshootingSo are you going to come  quietly  shouted  one  of  the  copsagain or are you going to let us blast you outWhich would you prefer shouted FordA millisecond later the air about them started to fry  again  asbolt  after  bolt  of  KillOZap hurled itself into the computerbank in front of themThe  fusillade  continued  for  several  seconds  at   unbearableintensityWhen it stopped there were a few seconds of  near  quietness  adthe echoes died awayYou still there called one of the copsYes they called backWe didnt enjoy doing that at all shouted the other copWe could tell shouted FordNow listen to this Beeblebrox and you better listen goodWhy shouted Back ZaphodBecause shouted the cop its going to be  very  intelligentand  quite  interesting  and  humane  Now  either  you  all giveyourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit though  not  verymuch  of  course  because  we  are  firmly  opposed  to  needlessviolence or we blow up this entire planet and  possibly  one  ortwo others we noticed on our way out hereBut thats crazy cried Trillian You wouldnt do thatOh yes we would shouted the cop wouldnt we he  asked  theother oneOh yes wed have to no question the other one called backBut why demanded TrillianBecause there are some things you have to do even if you are  anenlightened  liberal  cop  who  knows  all  about sensitivity andeverythingI just dont believe these guys  muttered  Ford  shaking  hisheadOne cop shouted to the other Shall we shoot them  again  for  abitYeah why notThey let fly another electric barrageThe heat and noise was quite fantastic Slowly the computer bankwas  beginning  to  disintegrate The front had almost all meltedaway and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding  their  wayback towards where they were squatting They huddled further backand waited for the endBut the end never came at least not thenQuite suddenly  the  barrage  stopped  and  the  sudden  silenceafterwards  was  punctuated  by a couple of strangled gurgles andthudsThe four stared at each otherWhat happened said ArthurThey stopped said Zaphod with a shrugWhyDunno do you want to go and ask themNoThey waitedHello called out FordNo answerThats oddPerhaps its a trapThey havent the witWhat were those thudsDunnoThey waited for a few more secondsRight said Ford Im going to have a lookHe glanced round at the othersIs no one going to  say  No  you  cant  possibly  let  me  goinsteadThey all shook their headsOh well he said and stood upFor a moment nothing happenedThen after a second or so nothing  continued  to  happen  Fordpeered  through  the  thick  smoke  that was billowing out of theburning computerCautiously he stepped out into the openStill nothing happenedTwenty yards away he  could  dimly  see  through  the  smoke  thespacesuited  figure  of  one  of  the  cops  He  was lying in acrumpled heap on the ground Twenty yards in the other  directionlay the second man No one else was anywhere to be seenThis struck Ford as being extremely oddSlowly nervously he walked towards the first one The body  layreassuringly  still  as  he  approached  it and continued to liereassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on  theKillOZap gun that still dangled from its limp fingersHe reached down and picked it up meeting no resistanceThe cop was quite clearly deadA quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa    hewas  a  methanebreathing  life form dependent on his space suitfor survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of MagratheaThe tiny lifesupport system computer on  his  backpack  appearedunexpectedly to have blown upFord poked around  in  it  in  considerable  astonishment  Theseminiature suit computers usually had the full backup of the maincomputer back on the ship with which they were  directly  linkedthrough  the  subetha  Such  a  system  was  failsafe  in  allcircumstances other than total feedback  malfunction  which  wasunheard ofHe hurried over to the other prone figure  and  discovered  thatexactly the same impossible thing had happened to him presumablysimultaneouslyHe called  the  others  over  to  look  They  came  shared  hisastonishment but not his curiosityLets get shot out of this hole said Zaphod If whatever  Imsupposed  to be looking for is here I dont want it He grabbedthe  second  KillOZap  gun  blasted   a   perfectly   harmlessaccounting computer and rushed out into the corridor followed bythe others He very nearly blasted hell out  of  an  aircar  thatstood waiting for them a few yards awayThe aircar was empty but Arthur recognized it  as  belonging  toSlartibartfastIt had a note from him pinned to part of  its  sparse  instrumentpanel  The note had an arrow drawn on it pointing at one of thecontrolsIt said This is probably the best button to pressThe aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R  through  thesteel  tunnels  that  lead  out onto the appalling surface of theplanet which was now in the grip of  yet  another  drear  morningtwilight Ghastly grey lights congealed on the landR is a velocity measure defined as a reasonable speed of  travelthat  is  consistent  with health mental wellbeing and not beingmore than say five minutes  late  It  is  therefore  clearly  analmost  infinitely  variable  figure  according to circumstancessince the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as  anabsolute  but  also  with  awareness of the third factor Unlesshandled with tranquility this equation can result in considerablestress ulcers and even deathR is not a fixed velocity but it is clearly far too fastThe aircar flung  itself  through  the  air  at  R  and  abovedeposited  them  next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly onthe frozen ground like a bleached bone  and  then  precipitatelyhurled  itself  back  in  the  direction  whence  they  had comepresumably on important business of its ownShivering the four of them stood and looked at the shipBeside it stood another oneIt was  the  Blagulon  Kappa  policecraft  a  bulbous  sharklikeaffair slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilledletters of  varying  degrees  of  size  and  unfriendliness  Theletters  informed  anyone  who cared to read them as to where theship was from what section of the police it was assigned to andwhere the power feeds should be connectedIt seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent even  for  a  shipwhose  twoman  crew  was  at that moment lying asphyxicated in asmokefilled chamber several miles beneath the ground It is  oneof  those curious things that is impossible to explain or definebut one can sense when a ship is completely deadFord could sense it and found it most mysterious  a ship and twopolicemen   seemed  to  have  gone  spontaneously  dead  In  hisexperience the Universe simply didnt work like thatThe other three could sense it too  but  they  could  sense  thebitter  cold  even  more  and hurried back into the Heart of Goldsuffering from an acute attack of no curiosityFord stayed and went to examine the Blagulon ship As he walkedhe  nearly  tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down inthe cold dustMarvin he exclaimed What are you doingDont feel you have to take any notice of me  please  came  amuffled droneBut how are you metalman said FordVery depressedWhats upI dont know said

finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother Of course she did This is the day of the reaping I prop myself up on one elbow Theres enough light in the bedroom to see them My little sister Prim curled up on her side cocooned in my mothers body their cheeks pressed together In sleep my mother looks younger still worn but not so beatendown Prims face is as fresh as a raindrop as lovely as the primrose for which she was named My mother was very beautiful once too Or sothey tell me Sitting at Prims knees guarding her is the worlds ugliest cat Mashedin nose half of one ear missing eyes the color of rotting squash Prim named him Buttercup insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower I he hates me Or at least distrusts me Even though it was years ago I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home Scrawny kitten belly swollen with worms crawling with fleas The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed But Prim begged so hard cried even I had to let him stay It turned out okay My mother got rid of the vermin and hes a born mouser Even catches the occasional rat Sometimes when I clean a kill I feed Buttercup the entrails He has stopped hissing at me Entrails No hissing This is the closest we will ever come to love I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots Supple leather that has molded to my feet I pull on trousers a shirt tuck my long dark braid up into a cap and grab my forage bag On the table under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves Prims gift to me on reaping day I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside Our part of District  nicknamed the Seam is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour Men and women with hunched shoulders swollen knuckles many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails the lines of their sunken faces But today the black cinder streets are empty Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed The reaping isnt until two May as well sleep in If you can Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow Separating the Meadow from the woods in fact enclosing all of District  is a high chainlink fence topped with barbedwire loops In theory its supposed to be electrified twentyfour hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods packs of wild dogs lone cougars bears that used to threaten our streets But since were lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings itsusually safe to touch Even so I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live Right now its silent as a stone Concealed by a clump of bushes I flatten out on my belly and slide under a twofoot stretch thatsbeen loose for years There are several other weak spots in the fence but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here As soon as Im in the trees I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log Electrified or not the fence has been successful at keeping the flesheaters out of District  Inside the woods they roam freely and there are added concerns like venomous snakes rabid animals and no real paths to follow But theres also food if you know how to find it My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion There was nothing even to bury I was eleven then Five years later I still wake up screaming for him to run Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties more people would risk it if they had weapons But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife My bow is a rarity crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods carefully wrapped in waterproof covers My father could have made good money selling them but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because theyre as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is In fact theyre among our best customers But the idea that someone might be arming the Seam would never have been allowed In the fall a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples But always in sight of the Meadow Always close enough to run back to the safety of District  if trouble arises District Twelve Where you can starve to death in safety I mutter Then I glance quickly over my shoulder Even here even in the middle of nowhere you worry someone might overhear you When I was younger I scared my mother to death the things I would blurt out about District  about the people who rule our country Panem from the faroff city called the Capitol Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts Do my work quietly in school Make only polite small talk in the public market Discuss little more than trades in the Hob which is the black market where I make most of my money Even at home where I am less pleasant I avoid discussing tricky topics Like the reaping or food shortages or the Hunger Games Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself Gale I can feel themuscles in my face relaxing my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place a rock ledgeoverlooking a valley A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile Gale says I never smile except in the woods Hey Catnip says Gale My real name is Katniss but when I first told him I had barely whispered it So he thought Id said Catnip Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts it became his official nickname for me I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game I almost regretted it because he wasnt bad company But I got a decent price for his pelt Look what I shot Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it and I laugh Its real bakery bread not the flat dense loaves we make from our grain rations I take it in my hands pull out the arrow and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva Fine bread like this is for special occasions Mm still warm I say He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it What did it cost you Just a squirrel Think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning says Gale Even wished me luck Well we all feel a little closer today dont we I say not even bothering to roll my eyes Prim left us a cheese I pull it out His expression brightens at the treat Thank you Prim Well have a real feast Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping I almost forgot Happy Hunger Games He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us And may the odds He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue Be ever in your favor I finish with equal verve We have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits Besides the Capitol accent is so affected almost anything sounds funny in it I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread He could be my brother Straight black hair olive skin we even have the same gray eyes But were not related at least not closely Most of the families who work the mines resemble one another this way Thats why my mother and Prim with their light hair and blue eyes always look out of place They are My mothers parents were part of the small merchant class thatcaters to officials Peacekeepers and the occasional Seam customer They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District  Since almost no one can afford doctors apothecaries are our healers My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies She must have really loved him to leave her home for the Seam I try to remember that when all I can see is the woman who sat by blank and unreachable while her children turned to skin and bones Itry to forgive her for my fathers sake But to be honest Im not the forgiving type Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of their berries We settle back in a nook in the rocks From this place we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley which is teeming with summer life greens to gather roots to dig fish iridescent in the sunlight The day is glorious with a blue sky and soft breeze The foods wonderful with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale hunting for tonights supper But instead we have to be standing in the square at two oclock waiting for the names to be called out We could do it you know Gale says quietly What I ask Leave the district Run off Live in the woods You and I we could make it says Gale I dont know how to respond The idea is so preposterous If we didnt have so many kids he adds quickly Theyre not our kids of course But they might as well be Gales two little brothers and a sister Prim And you may as well throw in our mothers too because how would they live without us Who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more With both of us hunting daily there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling I never want to have kids I say I might If I didnt live here says Gale But you do I say irritated Forget it he snaps back The conversation feels all wrong Leave How could I leave Prim who is the only person in the world Im certain I love And Gale is devoted to his family We cant leave so why bother talking about it And even if we did    Even if we did    Where did this stuff about having kids come from Theres never been anything romantic between Gale and me When we met I was a skinnytwelveyearold and although he was only two years older he already looked like a man It took a long time for us to even become friends to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out Besides if he wants kids Gale wont have any trouble finding a wife Hes goodlooking hes strong enough to handle the work in the mines and he can hunt You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think Good hunting partners are hard to find What do you want to do I ask We can hunt fish or gather Lets fish at the lake We can leave our poles and gather in the woods Get something nice for tonight he says Tonight After the reaping everyone is supposed to celebrate And a lot of people do out of relief that their children have been spared for another year But at least two families will pull their shutters lock their doorsand try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come We make out well The predators ignore us on a day when easier tastier prey abounds By late morning we have a dozen fish a bag of greens and best of all a gallon of strawberries I found the patch a few years ago but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals On the way home we swing by the Hob the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains the Hob gradually took over the space Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day but the black markets still fairly busy We easily trade six of the fish for good bread the other two for salt Greasy Sae the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin We might do a tad better elsewhere but we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae Shes the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog We dont hunt them on purpose but if youre attacked and you take out a dog or two well meat is meat Once its in the soup Ill call it beef Greasy Sae says with a wink No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog but the Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier When we finish our business at the market we go to the back door of the mayors house to sell half the strawberries knowing he hasa particular fondness for them and can afford our price The mayors daughter Madge opens the door Shes in my year at school Being the mayors daughter youd expect her to be a snob but shes all right She just keeps to herself Like me Since neither of us really has a group of friends we seem to end up together a lot at school Eating lunch sitting next to each other at assemblies partnering for sports activities We rarely talk which suits us both just fine Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon Reaping clothes Pretty dress says Gale Madge shoots him a look trying to see if its a genuine compliment or if hes just being ironic It is a pretty dress but she would never be wearing it ordinarily She presses her lips together and then smiles Well if I end up going to the Capitol I want to look nice dont I Now its Gales turn to be confused Does she mean it Or is she messing with him Im guessing the second You wont be going to the Capitol says Gale coolly His eyes land on a small circular pin that adorns her dress Real gold Beautifully crafted It could keep a family in bread for months What can you have Five entries I had six when I was just twelve years old Thats not her fault I say No its no ones fault Just the way it is says Gale Madges face has become closed offShe puts the money for the berries in my hand Good luck Katniss You too I say and the door closes We walk toward the Seam in silence I dont like that Gale took a dig at Madge but hes right of course The reaping system is unfair with the poor getting the worst of it You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve That year your name is entered once At thirteen twice And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen the final year of eligibility when your name goes into the pool seven times Thats true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem But heres the catch Say you are poor and starving as we were You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae Each tessera is worth a meager years supply of grain and oil for one person You may do this for each of your family members as well So at the age of twelve I had my name entered four times Once because I had to and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself Prim and my mother In fact every year I have needed to do this And the entries are cumulative So now at the age of sixteen my name will be in thereaping twenty times Gale who is eighteen and has been either helping or singlehandedly feeding a family of five for seven years will have his name in fortytwo times You can see why someone like Madge who has never been at risk of needing a tessera can set him off The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam Not impossible but slim And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol not the districts certainly not Madges family its hard not to resent those who dont have to sign up for tesserae Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected On other days deep in the woods Ive listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another Its to the Capitols advantage to have us divided among ourselves he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine If it wasnt reaping day If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what Im sure she thought was a harmless comment As we walk I glance over at Gales face still smoldering underneath his stony expression His rages seem pointless to me although I never say so Its not that I dont agree with him I do But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the woods It doesnt change anything It doesnt make things fair It doesnt fill our stomachs In fact it scares off the nearby game I let him yell though Better he does it in the woods than in the district Gale and I divide our spoils leaving two fish a couple of loaves of good bread greens a quart of strawberries salt paraffin and a bit of money for each See you in the square I say Wear somethingpretty he says flatly At home I find my mother and sister are ready to go My mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days Prim is in my first reaping outfit a skirt and ruffled blouse Its a bit big on her but my mother has made it stay with pins Even so shes having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back A tub of warm water waits for me I scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair To my surprise my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me A soft blue thing with matching shoes Are you sure I ask Im trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her For a while I was so angry I wouldnt allow her to do anything for me And this is something special Her clothes from herpast are very precious to her Of course Lets put your hair up too she says I let her toweldry it and braid it up on my head I can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall You look beautiful says Prim in a hushed voice And nothing like myself I say I hug her because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her Her first reaping Shes about as safe as you can get since shes only entered once I wouldnt let her take out any tesserae But shes worried about me That the unthinkable might happen I protect Prim in every way I can but Im powerless against the reaping The anguish I always feel when shes in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my ace I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm Tuck your tail in little duck I say smoothing the blouse back in place Prim giggles and gives me a small Quack Quack yourself I say with a light laugh The kind only Prim can draw out of me Come on lets eat I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew but that will be for supper We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evenings meal to make it special we say Instead we drink milk from Prims goat Lady and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain although no one has much appetite anyway At one oclock we head for the square Attendance is mandatory unless you are on deaths door This evening officials will come around and check to see if this is the case If not youll be imprisoned Its too bad really that they hold the reaping in the square one of the few places in District  that can be pleasant The squares surrounded by shops and on public market days especially if theres good weather it has a holiday feel to it But today despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings theres an air of grimness The camera crews perched like buzzards on rooftops only add to the effect People file in silently and sign in The reaping is a good opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as well Twelve through eighteenyearolds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages theoldest in the front the young ones like Prim toward the back Family members line up around the perimeter holding tightly to one anothers hands But there are others too who have no one they love at stake or who no longer care who slip among the crowd taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn Odds aregiven on their ages whether theyre Seam or merchant if they will break down and weep Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully carefully These same people tend to be informers and who hasnt broken the law I could be shot on a daily basis for hunting but the appetites of those in charge protect me Not everyone can claim the same Anyway Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head the bullet would be much quicker The space gets tighter more claustrophobic as people arrive The squares quite large but not enough to hold District s population of about eight thousand Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets where they can watch the event on screens as its televised live by the state I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building It holds three chairs a podium and two large glass balls one for the boys and one for the girls I stare at the paper slips in the girls ball Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting Two of the three chairs fill with Madges father Mayor Undersee whos a tall balding man and Effie Trinket District s escort fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin pinkish hair and spring green suit They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat Just as the town clock strikes two the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read Its the same story every year He tells of the history of Panem the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America He lists the disasters the droughts the storms the fires the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land the brutal war for what little sustenance remained The result was Panem a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens Then came the Dark Days the uprising of the districts against the Capitol Twelve were defeated the thirteenth obliterated The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated it gave us the Hunger Games The rules of the Hunger Games are simple In punishment for the uprising each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy called tributes to participate The twentyfour tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland Over a period of several weeks the competitors must fight to the deathThe last tribute standing wins Taking the kids from our districts forcing them to kill one another while we watch this is the Capitols way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion Whatever words they use the real message is clear Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and theres nothing you can do If you lift a finger we will destroy every last one of you Just as we did in District Thirteen To make it humiliating as well as torturous the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity a sporting event pitting every district against the others The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home and their district will be showered with prizes largely consisting of food All year the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks intones the mayor Then he reads the list of past District  victors In seventyfour years we have had exactly two Only one is still alive Haymitch Abernathy a paunchy middleaged man who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible staggers onto the stage and falls into the third chair Hes drunk Very The crowd responds with its token applause but hes confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug which she barely manages to fend off The mayor looks distressed Since all of this is being televised right now District  is the laughingstock of Panem and he knows it He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Effie Trinket Bright and bubbly as ever Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature Happy Hunger Games And may the odds be ever in your favor Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly offcenter since her encounter with Haymitch She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here although everyone knows shes just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation Through the crowd I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile As reapings go this one at least has a slight entertainment factor But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his fortytwo names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor Not compared to a lot of the boys And maybe hes thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away But there are still thousands of slips I wish I could whisper to him Its time for the drawing Effie Trinket says as she always does Ladies first and crosses tothe glass ball with the girls names She reaches in digs her hand deep into the ball and pulls out a slip of paper The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop and Im feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that its not me that itsnot me that its not me Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium smoothes the slip of paper and reads out the name in a clear voice And its not me Its Primrose EverdeenOne time when I was in a blind in a tree waiting motionless for game to wander by I dozed off and fell ten feet to the ground landing on my back It was as if the impact had knocked every wisp of air from my lungs and I lay there struggling to inhale to exhale to do anything Thats how I feel now trying to remember how to breathe unable to speak totally stunned as the name bounces around the inside of my skull Someone is gripping my arm a boy from the Seam and I think maybe I started to fall and he caught me There must have been some mistake This cant be happening Prim was one slip of paper in thousands Her chances of being chosen so remote that Id not even bothered to worry about her Hadnt I done everything Taken the tesserae refused to let her do the same One slip One slip in thousands The odds had been entirely in her favor But it hadnt mattered Somewhere far away I can hear the crowd murmuring unhappily as they always do when a twelveyearold gets chosen because no one thinks this is fair And then I see her the blood drained from her face hands clenched in fists at her sides walking with stiff small steps up toward the stage passing me and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt Its this detail the untucked blouse forming a ducktail that brings me back to myself Prim The strangled cry comes out of my throat and my muscles begin to move again Prim I dont need to shove through the crowd The other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage I reach her just as she is about to mount the steps With one sweep of my arm I push her behind me I volunteer I gasp I volunteer as tribute Theres some confusion on the stageDistrict  hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty The rule is that once a tributes name has been pulled from the ball another eligible boy if a boys name has been read or girl if a girls name has been read can step forward to take his or her place In some districts in which winning the reaping is such a great honor people are eager to risk their lives the volunteering is complicated But in District  where the word tribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse volunteers are all but extinct Lovely says Effie Trinket But I believe theres a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers and if one does come forth then we um    She trails off unsure herself What does it matter says the mayor Hes looking at me with a pained expression on his face He doesnt know me really but theres a faint recognition there I am the girl who brings the strawberries The girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion The girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother andsister as he presented her the oldest child with a medal of valor A medal for her father vaporized in the mines Does he remember that What does it matter he repeats gruffly Let her come forward Prim is screaming hysterically behind me Shes wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice No Katniss No You cant go Prim let go I say harshly because this is upsetting me and I dont want to cry When they televise the replay of the reapings tonight everyone will make note of my tears and Ill be marked as an easy target A weakling I will give no one that satisfaction Let go I can feel someone pulling her from my back I turn and see Gale has lifted Prim off the ground and shes thrashing in his arms Up you go Catnip he says in a voice hes fighting to keep steady and then he carries Prim off toward my mother I steel myself and climb the steps Well bravo gushes Effie Trinket Thats the spirit of the Games Shes pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it Whats your name I swallow hard Katniss Everdeen I say I bet my buttons that was your sister Dont want her to steal all the glory do we Come on everybody Lets give a big round of applause to our newest tribute trills Effie Trinket To the everlasting credit of the people of District  not one person claps Not even the ones holding betting slips the ones who are usually beyond caring Possibly because they know me from the Hob or knew my father or have encountered Prim who noone can help loving So instead of acknowledging applause I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage Silence Which says we do not agree We do not condone All of this is wrong Then something unexpected happens At least I dont expect it because I dont think of District  as a place that cares about me But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take Prims place and now it seems I have become someone precious At first one then another then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me It is an old and rarely used gesture of our district occasionally seen at funerals It means thanks it means admiration it means goodbye to someone you love Now I am truly in danger of crying but fortunately Haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me Look at her Look at this one he hollers throwing an arm around my shoulders Hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck I like her His breath reeks of liquor and its been a long time since hes bathed Lots of    He cant think of the word for a while Spunk he says triumphantly More than you he releases me and starts for the front of the stage More than you he shouts pointing directly into acamera Is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the Capitol Ill never know because just as hes opening his mouthto continue Haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious Hes disgusting but Im grateful With every camera gleefully trained on him I have just enough time to release the small choked sound in my throat and compose myself I put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance I can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale For a moment I yearn for something    The idea of us leaving the district    Making our way in the woods    But I know I was right about not running off Because who else would have volunteered for Prim Haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher and Effie Trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again What an exciting day she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig which has listed severely to the right But more excitement to come Its time to choose our boy tribute Clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys names and grabs the first slip she encounters She zips back to the podium and I dont even have time to wishfor Gales safety when shes reading the name Peeta Mellark Peeta Mellark Oh no I think Not him Because I recognize this name although I have never spoken directly to its owner Peeta Mellark No the odds are not in my favor today I watch him as he makes his way toward the stage Medium height stocky build ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead The shock of the moment is registering on his face you can see his struggle to remain emotionless but his blue eyes show the alarm Ive seen so often in prey Yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place Effie Trinket asks for volunteers but no one steps forward He has two older brothers I know Ive seen them in the bakery but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont This is standard Family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day What I did was the radical thing The mayor begins to read the long dull Treaty of Treason as he does every year at this point its required but Im not listening to a word Why him I think Then I try to convince myself it doesnt matter Peeta Mellark and I are not friends Not even neighbors We dont speak Our only real interaction happened years ago Hes probably forgotten it But I havent and I know I never will    It was during the worst time My father had beenkilled in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember The numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would hit me out of nowhere doubling me over racking my body with sobs Where are you I would cry out in my mind Where have you gone Of course there was never any answer The district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job Only she didnt She didnt do anything but sit propped up in achair or more often huddled under the blankets on her bed eyes fixed on some point in the distance Once in a while shed stir get up as if moved by some urgent purpose only to then collapse back into stillness No amount of pleading from Prim seemed to affect her I was terrified I suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness but at the time all I knew was that I had lost not only a father but a mother as well At eleven years old with Prim just seven I took over as head of the family There was no choice I bought our food at the market and cooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and myself looking presentableBecause if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home Id grown up seeing those home kids at school The sadness the marks of angry hands on their faces the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward I could never let that happen to Prim Sweet tiny Prim who cried when I cried before she even knew the reason who brushed and plaited my mothers hair before we left for school who still polished my fathers shaving mirror each night because hed hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the Seam The community home would crush her like a bug So I kept our predicament a secret But the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death Theres no other way to put it I kept telling myself if I could only hold out until May just May th I would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us Only there were still several weeks to go We could well be dead by then Starvations not an uncommon fate in District  Who hasnt seen the victims Older people who cant work Children from a family with too many to feed Those injured in the mines Straggling through the streets And one day you come upon them sitting motionless against a wall orlying in the Meadow you hear the wails from a house and the Peacekeepers are called in to retrieve the body Starvation is never the cause of death officially Its always the flu or exposure or pneumonia But that fools no one On the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark the rain was falling in relentless icy sheets I had been in town trying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prims in the public market but there were no takers Although I had been to the Hob on several occasions with my father I was too frightened to venture into that rough gritty place alone The rain had soaked through my fathers hunting jacket leaving me chilled to the bone For three days wed had nothing but boiled water with some old dried mint leaves Id found in the back of a cupboard By the time the market closed I was shaking so hard I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud puddle I didnt pick it up for fear I would keel over and be unable to regain my feet Besides no onewanted those clothes I couldnt go home Because at home was my mother with her dead eyes and my little sister with her hollow cheeks and cracked lips I couldnt walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches I had scavenged atthe edge of the woods after the coal had run out my bands empty of any hope I found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the shops that serve the wealthiest townspeople The merchants live above their businesses so I was essentially in their backyards I remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted for the spring a goat or two in a pen one sodden dog tied to a post hunched defeated in the muck All forms of stealing are forbidden in District  Punishable by death But it crossed my mind that there might be something in the trash bins and those were fair game Perhaps a bone at the butchers or rotted vegetables at the grocers something no one but my family was desperate enough to eat Unfortunately the bins had just been emptied When I passed the bakers the smell of fresh bread was so overwhelming I felt dizzy The ovens were in the back and a golden glow spilled out the open kitchen door I stood mesmerized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain interfered running its icy fingers down my back forcing me back to life I lifted the lid to the bakers trash bin and found it spotlessly heartlessly bare Suddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to see the bakers wife telling me to move on and did I want her to call the Peacekeepers andhow sick she was of having those brats from the Seam pawing through her trash The words were ugly and I had no defense As I carefully replaced the lid and backed away I noticed him a boy with blond hair peering out from behind his mothers back Id seen him at school He was in my year but I didnt know his name He stuck with the town kids so how would I His mother went back into the bakery grumbling but he must have been watching me as I made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned against the far side of an old apple tree The realization that Id have nothing to take home had finally sunk in My knees buckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots It was too much I was too sick and weak and tired oh so tired Let them call the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home I thought Or better yet let me die right here in the rain There was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman screaming again and the sound of a blow and I vaguely wondered what was going on Feet sloshed toward me through the mud and I thought Its her Shes coming to drive me away with a stick But it wasnt her It was the boy In his arms he carried two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire because the crusts were scorched black His mother was yelling Feed it to the pig you stupid creatureWhy not No one decent will buy burned bread He began to tear off chunks from the burned parts andtoss them into the trough and the front bakery bell rung and the mother disappeared to help a customer The boy never even glanced my way but I was watching him Because of the bread because of the red weal that stood out on his cheekbone What had she hit him with My parents never hit us I couldnt even imagine it The boy took one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast was clear then his attention back on the pig he threw a loaf of bread in my direction The second quickly followed and he sloshed back to the bakery closing the kitchen door tightly behind him I stared at the loaves in disbelief They were fine perfect really except for the burned areas Did he mean for me to have them He must have Because there they were at my feet Before anyone could witness what had happened I shoved the loaves up under my shirt wrapped the hunting jacket tightly about me and walked swiftly away The heat of the bread burned into my skin but I clutched it tighter clinging to life By the time I reached home the loaves had cooled somewhatbut the insides were still warm When I dropped them on the table Prims hands reached to tear off a chunk but I made her sit forced my mother to join us at the table and poured warm tea I scraped off the black stuff and sliced the bread We ate an entire loaf slice by slice It was good hearty bread filled with raisins and nuts I put my clothes to dry at the fire crawled into bed and fell into a dreamless sleep It didnt occur to me until the next morning that the boy might have burned the bread on purpose Might have dropped the loaves into the flames knowing it meant being punished and then delivered them to me But I dismissed this It must have been an accident Why would he have done it He didnt even know me Still just throwing me the bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely resulted in a beating if discovered  couldnt explain his actions We ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school It was as if spring had come overnight Warm sweet air Fluffy clouds At school I passed the boy in the hall his cheek had swelled up and his eye had blackened He was with his friends and didnt acknowledge me in any way But as I collected Prim and started for home that afternoon I found him staring at me from across the school yard Our eyes met for only a second then he turned his headaway I dropped my gaze embarrassed and thats when I saw it The first dandelion of the year A bell went off in my head I thought of the hours spent in the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to survive To this day I can never shake the connection between this boy Peeta Mellark and the bread that gave me hope and the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed And more than once I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me only to quickly flit away I feel like I owe him something and I hate owing people Maybe if Ihad thanked him at some point Id be feeling less conflicted now I thought about it a couple of times but the opportunity never seemed to present itself And now it never will Because were going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thankyou in there Somehow it just wont seem sincere if Im trying to slit his throat The mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and motions for Peeta and me to shake hands His are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread Peeta looks me right in the eye and gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring squeeze Maybe its just a nervous spasm We turn back toface the crowd as the anthem of Panem plays Oh well I think There will be twentyfour of us Odds are someone else will kill him before I do Of course the odds have not been very dependable of lateThe moment the anthem ends we are taken into custody I dont mean were handcuffed or anything but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past Ive never seen that happen though Once inside Im conducted to a room and left alone Its the richest place Ive ever been in with thick deep carpets and a velvet couch and chairs I know velvet because my mother has a dress with a collar made of the stuff When I sit on the couch I cant help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly It helps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour The time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved ones I cannot afford to get upset to leave this room with puffy eyes and a red nose Crying is not an option There will be morecameras at the train station My sister and my mother come first I reach out to Primand she climbs on my lap her arms around my neck headon my shoulder just like she did when she was a toddler My mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us For a few minutes we say nothing Then I start telling themall the things they must remember to do now that I will not be there to do them for them Prim is not to take any tesserae They can get by iftheyre careful on selling Prims goat milk and cheese and the small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people in the Seam Gale will get her the herbs she doesnt grow herself but she must be very careful to describe them because hes not as familiar with them as I am Hell also bring them game he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago and will probably not ask for compensation but they should thank him with some kind of trade like milk or medicine I dont bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous The woods terrified her and whenever I shot something shed get teary and talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home soon enough But she makes out well with her goat so I concentrate on that When I am done with instructions about fueland trading and staying in school I turn to my mother and grip her arm hard Listen to me Are you listening to me She nods alarmed by my intensity She must know whats coming You cant leave again I say My mothers eyes find the floor I know I wont I couldnt help what Well you have to help it this time You cant clock out and leave Prim on her own Theres no me now to keep you both alive It doesnt matter what happens Whatever you see on the screen You have to promise me youll fight through it My voice has risen to a shout In it is all the anger all the fear I felt at her abandonment She pulls her arm from my grasp moved to anger herself now I was ill I could have treated myself if Id had the medicine I have now That part about her being ill might be true Ive seen her bring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since Perhaps it is a sickness but its one we cant afford Then take it And take care of her I say Ill be all right Katniss says Prim clasping my face in her hands But you have to take care too Youre so fast and brave Maybe you can win I cant win Prim must know that in her heart The competition will be far beyond my abilities Kids from wealthier districts where winning is a huge honor whove been trained their whole lives for this Boys who are two to three times my size Girlswho know twenty different ways to kill you with a knife Oh therell be people like me too People to weed out before the real fun begins Maybe I say because I can hardly tell my mother to carry on if Ive already given up myself Besides it isnt in my nature to go down without a fight even when things seem insurmountable Then wed be rich as Haymitch I dont care if were rich I just want you to come home You will try wont you Really really try asks Prim Really really try I swear it I say And I know because of Prim Ill have to And then the Peacekeeper is at the door signaling our time is up and were all hugging one another so hard it hurts and all Im saying is I love you I love you both And theyre saying it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the door closes I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if this can block the whole thing out Someone else enters the room and when I look up Im surprised to see its the baker Peeta Mellarks father I cant believe hes come to visit me After all Ill be trying to kill his son soon But we do know each other a bit and he knows Prim even better When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob she puts two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous amount of bread in return We always wait to trade with him when his witch of a wifeisnt around because hes so much nicer I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way she did over the burned bread But why has he come to see me The baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush chairs Hes a big broadshouldered man with burn scars from years at the ovens He musthave just said goodbye to his son He pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and holds it out to me I open it and find cookies These are a luxury we can never afford Thank you I say The bakers not a very talkative man in the best of times and today he has no words at all I had some of your bread this morning My friend Gale gave you a squirrel for it He nods as if remembering the squirrel Not your best trade I say He shrugs as if it couldnt possibly matter Then I cant think of anything else so we sit in silence until a Peacemaker summons him He rises and coughs to clear his throat Ill keep an eye on the little girl Make sure shes eating I feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words People deal with me but they are genuinely fond of Prim Maybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive My next guest is also unexpected Madge walks straight to me She is not weepyor evasive instead theres an urgency about her tone that surprises me They let you wear one thing from your district in the arena One thing to remind you of home Will you wear this She holds out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier I hadnt paid much attention to it before but now I see its a small bird in flight Your pin I say Wearing a token from my district is about the last thing on my mind Here Ill put it on your dress all right Madge doesnt wait for an answer she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress Promise youll wear it into the arena Katniss she asks Promise Yes I say Cookies A pin Im getting all kinds of gifts today Madge gives me one more A kiss on the cheek Then shes gone and Im left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along Finally Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic between us but when he opens his arms I dont hesitate to go into them His body is familiar to me the way it moves the smell of wood smoke even the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet moments on a hunt but this is the first time I really feel it lean and hardmuscled against my own Listen he says Getting a knife should be pretty easy but youve got to get your hands on a bow Thats your best chance They dont always have bows I say thinking of theyear there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with Then make one says Gale Even a weak bow is better than no bow at all I have tried copying my fathers bows with poor results Its not that easy Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes I dont even know if therell be wood I say Another year they tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but boulders and sand and scruffy bushes I particularly hated that year Many contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went insane from thirst Theres almost always some wood Gale says Since that year half of them died of cold Not much entertainment in that Its true We spent one Hunger Games watching theplayers freeze to death at night You could hardly see them because they were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or torches or anything It was considered very anticlimactic in the Capitol all those quiet bloodless deaths Since then theres usually been wood to make fires Yes theres usually some I say Katniss its just hunting Youre the best hunter I know says Gale Its not just hunting Theyre armed They think I say So do you And youve had more practice Realpractice he says You know how to kill Not people I say How different can it be really says Gale grimly The awful thing is that if I can forget theyre people it will be no different at all The Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more time but theyre taking him away and I start to panic Dont let them starve I cry out clinging to his hand I wont You know I wont Katniss remember I he says and they yank us apart and slam the door and Ill never know what it was he wanted me to remember Its a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station Ive never been in a car before Rarely even ridden in wagons In the Seam we travel on foot Ive been right not to cry The station is swarming with reporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face But Ive had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall thats airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored Peeta Mellark on the other hand has obviously been crying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the Games To appear weak and frightened to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all and then come out fighting This worked verywell for a girl Johanna Mason from District  a few years back She seemed like such a sniveling cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left It turned out she could kill viciously Pretty clever the way she played it But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because hes a bakers son All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broadshouldered and strong It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him We have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the train while the cameras gobble up our images then were allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us The train begins to move at once The speed initially takes my breath away Of course Ive never been on a train as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties For us thats mainly transporting coal But this is no ordinary coal train Its one of the highspeed Capitol models that average  miles per hour Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day In school they tell us the Capitolwas built in a place once called the Rockies District  was in a region known isAppalachia Even hundreds of years ago they mined coal here Which is why our miners have to dig so deep Somehow it all comes back to coal at school Besides basic reading and math most of our instruction is coalrelated Except for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem Its mostly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol I know there must be more than theyre telling us an actual account of what happened during the rebellion But I dont spend much time thinking about it Whatever the truth is I dont see how it will help me get food on the table The tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Justice Building We are each given our own chambers that have a bedroom a dressing area and a private bathroom with hot and cold running water We dont have hot water at home unless we boil it There are drawers filled with fine clothes and Effie Trinket tells me to do anything I want wear anything I want everything is at my disposal Just be ready for supper in an hour I peel off my mothers blue dress and take a hot shower Ive never had a shower before Its like being in a summer rain only warmer I dress in a dark green shirt and pants At the last minute I remember Madges little gold pin For the first time I get a good look at it Its as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ringaround it The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips I suddenly recognize it A mocking jay Theyre funny birds and something of a slap in the face to the Capitol During the rebellion the Capitol bred a series of genetically altered animals as weapons The common term for them was muttations or sometimes mutts for short One was a special bird called a jabber jay that had the ability to memorize and repeat whole human conversations They were homing birds exclusively male that were released into regions where the Capitols enemies were known to be hiding After the birds gathered words theyd fly back to centers to be recorded It took people awhile to realize what was going on in the districts how private conversations were being transmitted Then of course the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies and the joke was on it So the centers were shut down and the birds were abandoned to die off in the wild Only they didnt die off Instead the jabber jays mated with female mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could replicate both bird whistles and human melodies They had lost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a range of human vocal sounds from a childs highpitched warble to a mans deep tones And they could recreate songs Not just a few notes but whole songswith multiple verses if you had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice My father was particularly fond of mockingjays When we went hunting he would whistle or sing complicated songs to them and after a politepause theyd always sing back Not everyone is treated with such respect But whenever my father sang all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen His voice was that beautiful high and clear and so filled with life it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time I could never bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone Still theres something comforting about the little bird Its like having a piece of my father with me protecting me I fasten the pin onto my shirt and with the dark green fabric as a background I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees Effie Trinket comes to collect me for supper I follow her through the narrow rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls Theres a table where all the dishes are highly breakable Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us the chair next to him empty Wheres Haymitch asks Effie Trinket brightly Last time I saw him he said he was going to take a nap says Peeta Well its been anexhausting day says Effie Trinket I think shes relieved by Haymitchs absence and who can blame her The supper comes in courses A thick carrot soup green salad lamb chops and mashed potatoes cheese and fruit a chocolate cake Throughout the meal Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because theres more to come But Im stuffing myself because Ive never had food like this so good and so much and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds At least you two have decent manners says Effie as were finishing the main course The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages It completely upset my digestion The pair last year were two kids from the Seam whod never not one day of their lives had enough to eat And when they did have food table manners were surely the last thing on their minds Peetas a bakers son My mother taught Prim and I to eat properly so yes I can handle a fork and knife But I hate Effie Trinkets comment so much I make a point of eating the rest of my meal with my fingers Then I wipe my hands on the tablecloth This makes her purse her lips tightly together Now that the meals over Im fighting to keep the food down I can see Peetas looking a little green too Neither of ourstomachs is used to such rich fare But if I can hold down Greasy Saes concoction of mice meat pig entrails and tree bark a winter specialty Im determined to hang on to this We go to another compartment to watch the recap of the reapings across Panem They try to stagger them throughout the day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing live but only people in the Capitol could really do that since none of them have to attend reapings themselves One by one we see the other reapings the names called the volunteers stepping forward or more often not We examine the faces of the kids who will be our competition A few stand out in my mind Amonstrous boy who lunges forward to volunteer from District  A foxfaced girl with sleek red hair from District  A boy with a crippled foot from District  And most hauntingly a twelveyearold girl from District  She has dark brown skin and eyes but other than that shes very like Prim in size and demeanor Only when she mounts the stage and they ask for volunteers all you can hear is the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around her Theres no one willing to take her place Last of all they show District  Prim being called me running forward tovolunteer You cant miss the desperation in my voice as I shove Prim behind me as if Im afraid no one will hear and theyll take Prim away But of course they do hear I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the stage The commentators are not sure what to say about the crowds refusal to applaud The silent salute One says that District  has always been a bit backward but that local customs can be charming As if on cue Haymitch falls off the stage and they groan comically Peetas name is drawn and he quietly takes his place We shake hands They cut to the anthem again and the program ends Effie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in Your mentor has a lot to learn about presentation A lot about televised behavior Peeta unexpectedly laughs He was drunk says Peeta Hes drunk every year Every day I add I cant help smirking a little Effie Trinket makes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough manners that could be corrected with a few tips from her Yes hisses Effie Trinket How odd you two find it amusing You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in these Games The one who advises you lines up your sponsors and dictates the presentation of any gifts Haymitch can well be the difference between your life and your death Just thenHaymitch staggers into the compartment I miss supper he says in a slurred voice Then he vomits all over the expensive carpet and falls in the mess So laugh away says Effie Trinket She hops in her pointy shoes around the pool of vomit and flees the roomFor a few moments Peeta and I take in the scene of our mentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his stomach The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my dinner up We exchange a glance Obviously Haymitch isnt much but Effie Trinket is right about one thing once were in the arena hes all weve got As if by some unspoken agreement Peeta and I each take one of Haymitchs arms and help him to his feet I tripped Haymitch asks Smells bad He wipes his hand on his nose smearing his face with vomit Lets get you back to your room says Peeta Clean you up a bit We halflead halfcarry Haymitch back to his compartment Since we cant exactly set him down on the embroidered bedspread we haul him into the bathtuband turn the shower on him He hardly notices Its okay Peeta says to me Ill take it from here I canthelp feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want to do is strip down Haymitch wash the vomit out of his chest hair and tuck him into bed Possibly Peeta is trying to make a good impression on him to be his favorite once the Games begin But judging by the state hes in Haymitch will have no memory of this tomorrow All right I say I can send one of the Capitol people to help you Theres any number on the train Cooking for us Waiting on us Guarding us Taking care of us is their job No I dont want them says Peeta I nod and head to my own room I understand how Peeta feels I cant stand the sight of the Capitol people myself But making them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of revenge So Im pondering the reason why he insists on taking care of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think Its because hes being kind Just as he was kind to give me the bread The idea pulls me up short A kind Peeta Mellark is far more dangerous to me than an unkind one Kind people have a way of working their way inside me and rooting there And I cant let Peeta do thisNot where were going So I decide from this moment on to have as little as possible to do with the bakers son When I get back to my room the train is pausing at a platform to refuel I quickly open the window toss the cookies Peetas father gave me out of the train and slam the glass shut No more No more of either of them Unfortunately the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track I only see the image for a moment because the train is off again but its enough Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago    I had just turned away from Peeta Mellarks bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasnt lost I plucked it carefully and hurried home I grabbed a bucket and Prims hand and headed to the Meadow and yes it was dotted with the goldenheaded weeds After wed harvested those we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until wed filled the bucket with the dandelion greens stems and flowers That night we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad and the rest of the bakery bread What else Prim asked me What other food can we find All kinds of things I promised her I just have to remember them My mother had a book shed brought with her from the apothecary shop The pages weremade of old parchment and covered in ink drawings of plants Neat handwritten blocks told their names where to gather them when they came in bloom their medical uses But my father added other entries to the book Plants for eating not healing Dandelions pokeweed wild onions pines Prim and I spent the rest of the night poring over those pages The next day we were off school For a while I hung around the edges of the Meadow but finally I worked up the courage to go under the fence It was the first time Id been there alone without my fathers weapons to protect me But Iretrieved the small bow and arrows hed made me from a hollow tree I probably didnt go more than twenty yards into the woods that day Most of the time I perched up in the branches of an old oak hoping for game to come by After several hours I had the good luck to kill a rabbit Id shot a few rabbits before with my fathers guidance But this Id done on my own We hadnt had meat in months The sight of the rabbit seemed to stir something in my mother She roused herself skinned the carcass and made a stew with the meat and some more greens Prim hadgathered Then she acted confused and went back to bed but when the stew was done we made her eat a bowl The woods became our savior and each day I went a bit farther into its arms It was slowgoing at first but I was determined to feed us I stole eggs from nests caught fish in nets sometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew and gathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet Plants are tricky Many are edible but one false mouthful and youre dead I checked and doublechecked the plants I harvested with my fathers pictures I kept us alive Any sign of danger a distant howl the inexplicable break of a branch sent me flying back to the fence at first Then I began to risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got bored and moved on Bears and cats lived deeper in perhaps disliking the sooty reek of our district On May th I went to the Justice Building signed up for my tesserae and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in Prims toy wagon On the eighth of every month I was entitled to do the same I couldnt stop hunting and gathering of course The grain was not enough to live on and there were other things to buy soap and milk and thread What we didnt absolutely have to eat I began to trade at the Hob It was frightening to enter that place without myfather at my side but people had respected him and they accepted me Game was game after all no matter whod shot it I also sold at the back doors of the wealthier clients in town trying to remember what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks as well The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels The baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his wife wasnt around The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey The mayor had a passion for strawberries In late summer I was washing up in a pond when I noticed the plants growing around me Tall with leaves like arrowheads Blossoms with three white petals I knelt down in the water my fingers digging into the soft mud and I pulled up handfuls of the roots Small bluish tubers that dont look like much but boiled or baked are as good as any potato Katniss I said aloud Its the plant I was named for And I heard my fathers voice joking As long as you can find yourself youll never starve I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my toes and a stick gathering the tubers that floated to the topThat night we feasted on fish and Katniss roots until we were all for the firsttime in months full Slowly my mother returned to us She began to clean and cook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter People traded us or paid money for her medical remedies One day I heard her singing Prim was thrilled to have her back but I kept watching waiting for her to disappear on us again I didnt trust her And some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weakness for her neglect for the months she had put us through Prim forgave her but I had taken a step back from my mother put up a wall to protect myself from needing her and nothing was ever the same between us again Now I was going to die without that ever being set right I thought of how I had yelled at her today in the Justice Building I had told her I loved her too though So maybe it would all balance out For a while I stand staring out the train window wishing I could open it again but unsure of what would happen at such high speed In the distance I see the lights of another district   I dont know I think about the people in their houses settling in for bed I imagine my home with its shutters drawn tight What are they doing now my mother and Prim Were they able to eat supper The fish stew and the strawberries Or did it lay untouched on their plates Did they watch the recap of the days events on the battered old TV that sits on the table against the wall Surely there were more tears Is my mother holding up being strong for Prim Or has she already started to slip away leaving the weight of the world on my sisters fragile shoulders Prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight The thought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the bed to watch over Prim comforts me If she cries he will nose his way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down and falls asleep Im so glad I didnt drown him Imagining my home makes me ache with loneliness This day has been endless Could Gale and I have been eating blackberries only this morning It seems like a lifetime ago Like a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare Maybe if I go to sleep I will wake up back in District  where I belong Probably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns but I just strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my underwear The sheets are made of soft silky fabric A thick fluffy comforter gives immediate warmth If Im going to cry now is the time to do it By morning Ill be able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face But no tears come Im too tired or too numb to cry The only thing I feel is a desire to be somewhere else So I let the train rock me into oblivion Gray light is leaking throughthe curtains when the rapping rouses me I hear Effie Trinkets voice calling me to rise Up up up Its going to be a big big big day I try and imagine for a moment what it must be like inside thatwomans head What thoughts fill her waking hours What dreams come to her at night I have no idea I put the green outfit back on since its not really dirty just slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor My fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and I think of the woods and of my father and of my mother and Prim waking up having to get on with things I slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the reaping and it doesnt look too bad so I just leave it up It doesnt matter We cant be far from the Capitol now And once we reach the city my stylist will dictate my look for the opening ceremonies tonight anyway I just hope I get one who doesnt think nudity is the last word in fashion As I enter the dining car Effie Trinket brushes by me with a cup of black coffee Shes muttering obscenities under her breath Haymitch his face puffy and red from the previous days indulgences is chuckling Peeta holds a roll and looks somewhat embarrassedSit down Sit down says Haymitch waving me over The moment I slide into my chair Im served an enormous platter of food Eggs ham piles of fried potatoes A tureen of fruit sits in ice to keep it chilled The basket of rolls they set before me would keep my family going for a week Theres an elegant glass of orange juice At least I think its orange juice Ive only even tasted an orange once at New Years when my father bought one as a special treat A cup of coffee My mother adores coffee which we could almost never afford but it only tastes bitter and thin to me A rich brown cup of something Ive never seen They call it hot chocolate says Peeta Its good I take a sip of the hot sweet creamy liquid and a shudder runs through me Even though the rest of the meal beckons I ignore it until Ive drained my cup Then I stuff down every mouthful I can hold which is a substantial amount being careful to not overdo it on the richest stuff One time my mother told me that I always eat like Ill never see food again And I said I wont unless I bring it home That shut her up When my stomach feels like its about to split open I lean back and take in my breakfast companions Peeta is still eating breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate Haymitch hasnt paid much attention to his platter but hes knockingback a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with a clear liquid from a bottle Judging by the fumes its some kind of spirit I dont know Haymitch but Ive seen him often enough in the Hob tossing handfuls of money on the counter of the woman who sells white liquor Hell be incoherent by the time we reach the Capitol I realize I detest Haymitch No wonder the District  tributes never stand a chance It isnt just that weve been underfed and lack training Some of our tributes have still been strong enough to make a go of it But we rarely get sponsors and hes a big part of the reason why The rich people who back tributeseither because theyre betting on them or simply for the bragging rights of picking a winner expect someone classier than Haymitch to deal with So youre supposed to give us advice I say to Haymitch Heres some advice Stay alive says Haymitch and then bursts out laughing I exchange a look with Peeta before I remember Im having nothing more to do with him Im surprised to see the hardness in his eyes He generally seems so mild Thats very funny says Peeta Suddenly he lashes out at the glass in Haymitchs hand It shatters on the floor sending the bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train Only not to us Haymitch considers this a moment then punches Peeta in the jaw knocking him from his chair When he turns back to reach for the spirits I drive my knife into the table between his hand and the bottle barely missing his fingers I brace myself to deflect his hit but it doesnt come Instead he sits back and squints at us Well whats this says Haymitch Did I actually get a pair of fighters this year Peeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice from under the fruit tureen He starts to raise it to the red mark on his jaw No says Haymitch stopping him Let the bruise show The audience will think youve mixed it up with another tribute before youve even made it to the arena Thats against the rules says Peeta Only if they catch you That bruise will say you fought you werent caught even better says Haymitch He turns to me Can you hit anything with that knife besides a table The bow and arrow is my weapon But Ive spent a fair amount of time throwing knives as well Sometimes if Ive wounded an animal with an arrow its better to get a knife into it too before I approach it I realize that if I want Haymitchs attention this is my moment to make an impression I yank the knife out of the table get a grip on the blade and then throw it into the wallacross the room I was actually just hoping to get a good solid stick but it lodges in the seam between two panels making me look a lot better than I am Stand over here Both of you says Haymitch nodding to the middle of the room We obey and he circles us prodding us like animals at times checking our muscles examining our faces Well youre not entirely hopeless Seem fit And once the stylists get hold of you youll be attractive enough Peeta and I dont question this The Hunger Games arent a beauty contest but the bestlooking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors All right Ill make a deal with you You dont interfere with my drinking and Ill stay sober enough to help you says Haymitch But you have to do exactly what I say Its not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all Fine says Peeta So help us I say When we get to the arena whats the best strategy at the Cornucopia for someone One thing at a time In a few minutes well be pulling into the station Youll be put in thehands of your stylists Youre not going to like what they do to you But no matter what it is dont resist says Haymitch But I begin No buts Dont resist says Haymitch He takes the bottle of spirits from the table and leaves the car As the door swings shut behind him the car goes dark There are still a few lights inside but outside its as if night has fallen again I realize we must be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into the Capitol The mountains form a natural barrier between the Capitol and the eastern districts It is almost impossible to enter from the east except through the tunnels This geographical advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war that led to my being a tribute today Since the rebels had to scale the mountains they were easy targets for the Capitols air forces Peeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds along The tunnel goes on and on and I think of the tons of rock separating me from the sky and my chest tightens I hate being encased in stone this way It reminds me of the mines and my father trapped unable to reach sunlight buried forever in the darkness The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light floods the compartment We cant help it Both Peeta and I run to the window to see what weve only seen on television the Capitol the ruling city of Panem The cameras havent lied about its grandeur If anything they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening buildings ina rainbow of hues that tower into the air the shiny cars that roll down the wide paved streets the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair and painted faces who have never missed a meal All the colors seem artificial the pinks too deep the greens too bright the yellows painful to the eyes like the flat round disks of hard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop in District  The people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a tribute train rolling into the city I step away from the window sickened by their excitement knowing they cant wait to watch us die But Peeta holds his ground actually waving and smiling at the gawking crowd He only stops when the train pulls into the station blocking us from their view He sees me staring at him and shrugs Who knows he says One of them may be rich I have misjudged him I think of his actions since the reaping began The friendly squeeze of my hand His father showing up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim    Did Peeta put him up to that His tears at the station Volunteering to wash Haymitch but then challenging him this morning when apparently the niceguy approach had failed And now the waving at the window already trying to win the crowd All of the pieces are still fitting together but I sense he has a plan forming He hasnt acceptedhis death He is already fighting hard to stay alive Which also means that kind Peeta Mellark the boy who gave me the bread isfighting hard to kill meRiiip I grit my teeth as Venia a woman with aqua hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows yanks a strip of Fabric from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it Sorry she pipes in her silly Capitol accent Youre just so hairy Why do these people speak in such a high pitch Why do their jaws barely open when they talk Why do the ends of their sentences go up as if theyre asking a question Odd vowels clipped words and always a hiss on the letter s    No wonder its impossible not to mimic them Venia makes whats supposed to be a sympathetic face Good news though This is the last one Ready I get a grip on the edges of the table Im seated on and nod The final swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk Ive been in the Remake Center for more than three hours and I still havent met my stylist Apparently he has no interest in seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep team have addressed some obvious problems This has included scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin turning my nails into uniform shapes and primarily ridding my body of hair My legs arms torso underarms and parts of my eyebrows have been stripped of the Muff leaving me like a plucked bird ready for roasting I dont like it My skin feels sore and tinglingand intensely vulnerable But I have kept my side of the bargain with Haymitch and no objection has crossed my lips Youre doing very well says some guy named Flavius He gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh coat of purple lipstick to his mouth If theres one thing we cant stand its a whiner Grease her down Venia and Octavia a plump woman whose entire body has been dyed a pale shade of pea green rub me down with a lotion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin Then they pull me from the table removing the thin robe Ive been allowed to wear off and on I stand there completely naked as the three circle me wielding tweezers to remove any last bits of hair I know I should be embarrassed but theyre so unlike people that Im no more selfconscious than if a trio of oddly colored birds were pecking around my feet The three step back and admire their work Excellent You almost look like a human being now says Flavius and they all laugh I force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I am Thank you I say sweetly We dont have much cause to look nice in District Twelve This wins them over completely Of course you dont you poor darling says Octavia clasping her hands together in distress for me But dont worry says Venia By the time Cinna is through with you youre going to be absolutely gorgeous We promise You know now that weve gotten rid of all the hair and filth youre not horrible at all says Flavius encouragingly Lets call Cinna They dart out of the room Its hard to hate my prep team Theyre such total idiots And yet in an odd way I knowtheyre sincerely trying to help me I look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the impulse to retrieve my robe But this Cinna my stylist will surely make me remove it at once Instead my hands go to my hairdo the one area of my body my prep team had been told to leave alone My fingers stroke the silky braids my mother so carefully arranged My mother I left her blue dress and shoes on the floor of my train car never thinking about retrieving them of trying to hold on to a piece of her of home Now I wish I had The door opens and a young man who must be Cinna enters Im taken aback by how normal he looks Most of the stylists they interview on television are so dyed stenciled and surgically altered theyre grotesque But Cinnas closecropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown Hes in a simple black shirt and pants The only concession to selfalteration seems to be metallic goldeyeliner that has been applied with a light hand It brings out the flecks of gold in his green eyes And despite my disgust with the Capitol and their hideous fashions I cant help thinking how attractive it looks Hello Katniss Im Cinna your stylist he says in a quiet voice somewhat lacking in the Capitols affectations Hello I venture cautiously Just give me a moment all right he asks He walks around my naked body not touching me but taking in every inch of it with his eyes I resist the impulse to cross my arms over my chest Who did your hair My mother I say Its beautiful Classic really And in almost perfect balance with your profile She has very clever fingers he says I had expected someone flamboyant someone older trying desperately to look young someone who viewed me as a piece of meat to be prepared for a platter Cinna has met none of these expectations Youre new arent you I dont think Ive seen you before I say Most of the stylists are familiar constants in the everchanging pool of tributes Some have been around my whole life Yes this is my first year in the Games says Cinna So they gave you District Twelve I say Newcomers generally end up with us the least desirable district I asked for District Twelve he says without further explanation Why dont you put on your robe and well have a chat Pulling on my robe I follow him through a door into a sitting room Two red couches face off over a low table Three walls are blank the fourth is entirely glass providing a window to the city I can see by the light that it must be around noon although the sunny sky has turned overcast Cinna invites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across from me He presses a button on the side of the table The top splits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our lunch Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy sauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain tiny green peas and onions rolls shaped like flowers and for dessert a pudding the color of honey I try to imagineassembling this meal myself back home Chickens are too expensive but I could make do with a wild turkey Id need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange Goats milk would have to substitute for cream We can grow peas in the garden Id have to get wild onions from the woods I dont recognize the grain our own tessera ration cooks down to an unattractive brown mush Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker perhaps for two or three squirrels As for thepudding I cant even guess whats in it Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version What must it be like I wonder to live in a world where food appears at the press of a button How would I spend the hours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it were so easy to come by What do they do all day these people in the Capitol besides decorating their bodies and waiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and die for their entertainment I look up and find Cinnas eyes trained on mine How despicable we must seem to you he says Has he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts Hes right though The whole rotten lot of them is despicable No matter says Cinna So Katniss about your costume for the opening ceremonies My partner Portia is the stylist for your fellow tribute Peeta And our current thought is to dress you in complementary costumes says Cinna As you know its customary to reflect the flavor of the district For the opening ceremonies youre supposed to wear something that suggests your districts principal industry District  agriculture District  fishing District  factories This means that coming from District  Peeta and I will be in some kind of coal miners getupSince the baggy miners jumpsuits are not particularly becoming our tributes usually end up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps One year our tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to represent coal dust Its always dreadful and does nothing to win favor with the crowd I prepare myself for the worst So Ill be in a coal miner outfit I ask hoping it wont be indecent Not exactly You see Portia and I think that coal miner things very overdone No one will remember you in that And we both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes unforgettable says Cinna Ill be naked for sure I think So rather than focus on the coal mining itself were going to focus on the coal says Cinna Naked and covered in black dust I think And what do we do with coal We burn it says Cinna Youre not afraid of fire are you Katniss He sees my expression and grins A few hours later I am dressed in what will either be the most sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ceremonies Im in a simple black unitard that covers me from ankle to neck Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees But its the fluttering cape made of streams of orange yellowand red and the matching headpiece that define this costume Cinna plans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the streets Its not real flame of course just a little synthetic fire Portia and I came up with Youll be perfectly safe he says But Im not convinced I wont be perfectly barbecued by the time we reach the citys center My face is relatively clear of makeup just a bit of highlighting here and there My hair has been brushed out and then braided down my back in my usual style I want the audience to recognize you when youre in the arena says Cinna dreamily Katniss the girl who was on fire It crosses my mind that Cinnas calm and normal demeanor masks a complete madman Despite this mornings revelation about Peetas character Im actually relieved when he shows up dressed in an identical costume He should know about fire being a bakers son and all His stylist Portia and her team accompany him in and everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a splash well make Except Cinna He just seems a bit weary as he accepts congratulations Were whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake Center which is essentially a gigantic stable The opening ceremonies are about to start Pairs of tributes are being loaded into chariots pulled by teams of four horsesOurs are coal black The animals are so well trained no one even needs to guide their reins Cinna and Portia direct us into the chariot and carefully arrange our body positions the drape of our capes before moving off to consult with each other What do you think I whisper to Peeta About the fire Ill rip off your cape if youll rip off mine he says through gritted teeth Deal I say Maybe if we can get them off soon enough well avoid the worst burns Its bad though Theyll throw us into the arena no matter what condition were in I know we promised Haymitch wed do exactly what they said but I dont think he considered this angle Where is Haymitch anyway Isnt he supposed to protect us from this sort of thing says Peeta With all that alcohol in him its probably not advisable to have him around an open flame I say And suddenly were both laughing I guess were both so nervous about the Games and more pressingly petrified of being turned into human torches were not acting sensibly The opening music begins Its easy to hear blasted around the Capitol Massive doors slide open revealing the crowdlined streets The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up at the City Circle where they will welcome us play the anthem and escort us into the Training Center which will be our homeprison untilthe Games begin The tributes from District  ride out in a chariot pulled by snowwhite horses They look so beautiful spraypainted silver in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels District  makes luxury items for the Capitol You can hear the roar of the crowd They are always favorites District  gets into position to follow them Inno time at all we are approaching the door and I can see that between the overcast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray The tributes from District  are just rolling out when Cinna appears with a lighted torch Here we go then he says and before we can react he sets our capes on fire I gasp waiting for the heat but there is only a faint tickling sensation Cinna climbs up before us and ignites our headdresses He lets out a sign of relief It works Then he gently tucks a hand under my chin Remember heads high Smiles Theyre going to love you Cinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea He shouts something up at us but the music drowns him out He shouts again and gestures Whats he saying I ask Peeta For the first time I look at him and realize that ablaze with the fake flames he is dazzling And I must be too I think he said for us to hold hands says Peeta He grabs my right hand in his left and we look to Cinna for confirmation He nods and gives a thumbsup and thats the last thing I see before we enter the city The crowds initial alarm at our appearance quickly changes to cheers and shouts of District Twelve Every head is turned our way pulling the focus from the three chariots ahead of us At first Im frozen but then I catch sight of us on a large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking we look In the deepening twilight the firelight illuminates our faces We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing capes Cinna was right about the minimal makeup we both look more attractive but utterly recognizable Remember heads high Smiles Theyre going to love you I hear Cinnas voice in my head I lift my chin a bit higher put on my most winning smile and wave with my free hand Im glad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance he is so steady solid as a rock As I gain confidence I actually blow a few kisses to the crowd The people of the Capitol are going nuts showering us with flowers shouting our names our first names which they have bothered to find on the program The pounding music the cheers the admiration work their way into my blood and I cant suppress my excitement Cinna has given me a great advantage No one will forget me Not my look not my nameKatniss The girl who was on fire For the first time I feel a flicker of hope rising up in me Surely there must be one sponsor willing to take me on And with a little extra help some food the right weapon why should I count myself out of the Games Someone throws me a red rose I catch it give it a delicate sniff and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver A hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss as if it were a real and tangible thing Katniss Katniss I can hear my name being called from all sides Everyone wants my kisses Its not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I must have completely stopped the circulation in Peetas hand Thats how tightly Ive been holding it I lookdown at our linked fingers as I loosen my grasp but he regains his grip on me No dont let go of me he says The firelight flickers off his blue eyes Please I might fall out of this thing Okay I say So I keep holding on but I cant help feeling strange about the way Cinna has linked us together Its not really fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the arena to kill each other The twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle On the buildings that surround the Circle every window is packed with the most prestigious citizens of the Capitol Our horses pull our chariot right up to President Snows mansion and we come to a halt The music ends with a flourish The president a small thin man with paperwhite hair gives the official welcome from a balcony above us It is traditional to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the speech But I can see on the screen that we are getting way more than our share of airtime The darker it becomes the more difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering When the national anthem plays they do make an effort to do a quick cut around to each pair of tributes but the camera holds on the District  chariot as it parades around the circle one final time and disappears into the Training Center The doors have only just shut behind us when were engulfed by the prep teams who are nearly unintelligible as they babble out praise As I glance around I notice a lot of the other tributes are shooting us dirty looks which confirms what Ive suspected weve literally outshone them all Then Cinna and Portia are there helping us down from the chariot carefully removing our flaming capes and headdresses Portia extinguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister I realize Im still glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to open We both massage our hands Thanksfor keeping hold of me I was getting a little shaky there says Peeta It didnt show I tell him Im sure no one noticed Im sure they didnt notice anything but you You should wear flames more often he says They suit you And then he gives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me A warning bell goes off in my head Dont be so stupid Peeta is planning how to kill you I remind myself He is luring you in to make you easy prey The more likable he is the more deadly he is But because two can play at this game I stand on tiptoe and kiss his cheek Right on his bruiseThe Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for the tributes and their teams This will be our home until the actual Games begin Each district has an entire floor You simply step onto an elevator and press the number of your district Easy enough to remember Ive ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice Building back in District  Once to receive the medal for my fathers death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to my friends andfamily But thats a dark and creaky thing that moves like a snail and smells of sour milk The walls of this elevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people on the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air Its exhilarating and Im tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can ride it again but somehow that seems childish Apparently Effie Trinkets duties did not conclude at the station She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the arena In a way thats a plus because at least she can be counted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we havent seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train Probably passed out somewhere Effie Trinket on the other hand seems to be flying high Were the first team shes ever chaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies Shes complimentary about not just our costumes but how we conducted ourselves And to hear her tell it Effie knows everyone whos anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up all day trying to win us sponsors Ive been very mysterious though she says her eyes squint half shut Because of course Haymitch hasnt bothered totell me your strategies But Ive done my best with what I had to work with How Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister How youve both successfully struggled to overcome the barbarism of your district Barbarism Thats ironic coming from a woman helping to prepare us for slaughter And whats she basing our success on Our table manners Everyone has their reservations naturally You being from the coal district But I said and this was very clever of me I said Well if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice but to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though its wrong Coal doesnt turn to pearls They grow in shellfish Possibly she meant coal turns to diamonds but thats untrue too Ive heard they have some sort of machine in District  that can turn graphite into diamonds But we dont mine graphite in District  That was part of District s job until they were destroyed I wonder if the people shes been plugging us to all day either know or care Unfortunately I cant seal the sponsor deals for you Only Haymitch can do that says Effie grimly But dont worry Ill get him to the table at gunpoint if necessary Although lacking in many departments Effie Trinket has a certain determination I have to admire My quarters are larger than our entire house back home They are plush like the train car but also have so many automatic gadgets that Im sure I wont have time to press all the buttons The shower alone has a panel with more than a hundred options you can choose regulating water temperature pressure soaps shampoos scents oils and massaging sponges When you step out on a mat heaters come on that blowdry your body Instead of struggling with the knots in my wet hair I merely place my hand on a box that sendsa current through my scalp untangling parting and drying my hair almost instantly It floats down around my shoulders in a glossy curtain I program the closet for an outfit to my taste The windows zoom in and out on parts of the city at my command You need only whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a mouthpiece and it appears hot and steamy before you in less than a minute I walk around the room eating goose liver and puffy bread until theres a knock on the door Effies calling me to dinner Good Im starving Peeta Cinna and Portia are standing out on a balcony that overlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room Im gladto see the stylists particularly after I hear that Haymitch will be joining us A meal presided over by just Effie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster Besides dinner isnt really about food its about planning out our strategies and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable they are A silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all stemmed glasses of wine I think about turning it down but Ive never had wine except the homemade stuff my mother uses for coughs and when will I get a chance to try it again I take a sip of the tart dry liquid and secretly think it could be improved by a few spoonfuls of honey Haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served It looks as if hes had his own stylist because hes clean and groomed and about as sober as Ive ever seen him He doesnt refuse the offer of wine but when he starts in on his soup I realize its the first time Ive ever seen him eat Maybe he really will pull himself together long enough to help us Cinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Haymitch and Effie At least theyre addressing each other decently And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists opening act While they make small talk I concentrate on the meal Mushroom soup bitter greens with tomatoes the size of peas rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper noodles in a green sauce cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet blue grapes The servers all young people dressed in white tunics like the one who gave us wine move wordlessly to and from the table keeping the platters and glasses full About halfway through my glass of wine my head starts feeling foggy so I change to water instead I dont like the feeling and hope it wears off soon How Haymitch can stand walking around like this fulltime is a mystery I try to focus on the talk which has turned to our interview costumes when a girl sets a gorgeouslooking cake on the table and deftly lights it It blazes up and then the flames flicker around the edges awhile until it finally goes out I have a moment of doubt What makes it burn Is it alcohol I say looking up at the girl Thats the last thing I wa oh I know you I cant place a name or time to the girls face But Im certain of it The dark red hair the striking features the porcelain white skin But even as I utter the words I feel my insides contracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her and while I cant pull it up I know some bad memory is associated with her The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds to my confusion and unease She shakes her head in denial quickly and hurries away from the table When I look back the four adults are watching me like hawks Dont be ridiculous Katniss How could you possibly know an Avox snaps Effie The very thought Whats an Avox I ask stupidly Someone who committed a crime They cut her tongue so she cant speak says Haymitch Shes probably a traitor of some sort Not likely youd know her And even if you did youre not to speak to one of them unless its to give an order says Effie Of course you dont really know her But I do know her And now that Haymitch has mentioned the word traitor I remember from where Thedisapproval is so high I could never admit it No I guess not I just I stammer and the wine is not helping Peeta snaps his fingers Delly Cartwright Thats who it is I kept thinking she looked familiar as well Then I realized shes a dead ringer for Delly Delly Cartwright is a pastyfaced lumpy girl with yellowish hair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does a butterfly She may also be the friendliest person on the planet she smiles constantly at everybody in school even me I have never seen the girl with the red hair smile But I jump on Peetas suggestion gratefully Of course thats who I was thinking of It must be the hair I say Something about the eyes too says Peeta The energy at the table relaxes Oh well If thats all it is says Cinna And yes the cake has spirits but all the alcohol has burned off I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery debut We eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the replay of the opening ceremonies thats being broadcast A few of the other couples make a nice impression but none of them can hold a candle to us Even our own party lets out an Ahh as they show us coming out of the Remake Center Whose idea was the hand holding asks Haymitch Cinnas says Portia Just the perfect touch of rebellion says Haymitch Very nice Rebellion I have to think about that one a moment But when I remember the other couples standing stiffly apart never touching or acknowledging each other as if their fellow tribute did not exist as if the Games had already begun I know what Haymitch means Presenting ourselves not as adversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the fiery costumes Tomorrow morning is the first training session Meet me for breakfast and Ill tell you exactly how I want you to play it says Haymitch to Peeta and I Now go get some sleep while the grownups talk Peeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms When we get to my door he leans against the frame not blocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to him So Delly CartwrightImagine finding her lookalike here Hes asking for an explanation and Im tempted to give him one We both know he covered for me So here I am in his debt again If I tell him the truth about the girl somehow that might even things up How can it hurt really Even if he repeated the story it couldnt do me much harm It was just something I witnessed And he lied as much as I did about Delly Cartwright I realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl Someone who might be able tohelp me figure out her story Gale would be my first choice but its unlikely Ill ever see Gale again I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any possible advantage over me but I dont see how Maybe sharing a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a friend Besides the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frightens me She has reminded me why Im here Not to model flashy costumes and eat delicacies But to die a bloody death while the crowds urge on my killer To tell or not to tell My brain still feels slow from the wine I stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there Peeta picks up on my hesitation Have you been on the roof yet I shake my head Cinna showed me You can practically see the whole city The winds a bit loud though I translate this into No one will overhear us talking in my head You do have the sense that we might be under surveillance here Can we just go up Sure come on says Peeta I follow him to a flight of stairs that lead to the roof Theres a small domeshaped room with a door to the outside As we step into the cool windy evening air I catch my breath at the view The Capitol twinkles like a vast field of fireflies Electricity in District  comes and goes usually we only have it a few hours a day Often the evenings are spent in candlelight The only time you can count on it is when theyre airing the Games or some important government message on television that its mandatory to watch But here there would be no shortage Ever Peeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof I look straight down the side of the building to the street which is buzzing with people You can hear their cars an occasional shout and a strange metallic tinkling In District  wed all be thinking about bed right now I asked Cinna why they let us up here Werent they worried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over the side says Peeta Whatd he say I ask You cant says Peeta He holds out his hand into seemingly empty space Theres a sharp zap and he jerks it back Some kind of electric field throws you back on the roof Always worried about our safety I say Even though Cinna has shown Peeta the roof I wonder if were supposed to be up here now so late and alone Ive never seen tributes on the Training Center roof before But that doesnt mean were not being taped Do you think theyre watching us now Maybe he admits Come see the garden On the other side of the dometheyve built a garden with flower beds and potted trees From the brancheshang hundreds of wind chimes which account for the tinkling I heard Here in the garden on this windy night its enough to drown out two people who are trying not to be heard Peeta looks at me expectantly I pretend to examine a blossom We were hunting in the woods one day Hidden waiting for game I whisper You and your father he whispers back No my friend Gale Suddenly all the birds stopped singing at once Except one As if it were giving a warning call And then we saw her Im sure it was the same girl A boy was with her Their clothes were tattered They had dark circles under their eyes from no sleep They were running as if their lives depended on it I say For a moment Im silent as I remember how the sight of this strange pair clearly not from District  fleeing through the woods immobilized us Later we wondered if we could have helped them escape Perhaps we might have Concealed them If wed moved quickly Gale and I were taken by surprise yes but were both hunters We know how animals look at bay We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw them But we only watched The hovercraft appeared out of nowhere I continue to Peeta I mean one moment the sky was empty and the next it was there It didnt make a sound but they saw it A net dropped down on the girl and carried her up fast so fast like the elevator They shot some sort of spear through the boy It was attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well But Im certain he was dead We heard the girl scream once The boys name I think Then it was gone the hovercraft Vanished into thin air And the birds began to sing again as if nothing had happened Did they see you Peeta asked I dont know We were under a shelf of rock I reply But I do know There was a moment after the birdcall but before the hovercraft where the girl had seen us Shed locked eyes with me and called out for help But neither Gale or I had responded Youre shivering says Peeta The wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my body The girls scream Had it been her last Peeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoulders I start to take a step back but then I let him deciding for a moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness A friend would do that right They were from here he asks and he secures a button at my neck I nod Theyd had that Capitol look about them The boy and the girl Where do you suppose they were going he asks I dont know that I say District  is pretty much the end of the line Beyond us theres only wilderness If you dont count the ruins of District  that still smolder from the toxicbombs They show it on television occasionally just to remind us Or why they would leave here Haymitch had called the Avoxes traitors Against what It could only be the Capitol But they had everything here No cause to rebel Id leave here Peeta blurtsout Then he looks around nervously It was loud enough to hear above the chimes He laughs Id go home now if they let me But you have to admit the foods prime Hes covered again If thats all youd heard it would just sound like the words of a scared tribute not someone contemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol Its getting chilly We better go in he says Inside the dome its warm and bright His tone is conversational Your friend Gale Hes the one who took your sister away at the reaping Yes Do you know him I ask Not really I hear the girls talk about him a lot I thought he was your cousin or something You favor each other he says No were not related I say Peeta nods unreadable Did he come to say goodbye to you Yes I say observing him carefully So did your father He brought me cookies Peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news But after watching him lie so smoothly I dont give this much weight Really Well he likes you and your sister I think he wishes he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys The idea that I might ever have been discussed around the dinner table at the bakery fire just in passing in Peetas house gives me a start It must have been when the mother was out of the room He knew your mother when they were kids says Peeta Another surprise But probably true Oh yes She grew up in town I say It seems impolite to say she never mentioned the baker except to compliment his bread Were at my door I give back his jacket See you in the morning then See you he says and walks off down the hall When I open my door the redheaded girl is collecting my unitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before my shower I want to apologize for possibly getting her in trouble earlier But I remember Im not supposed to speak to her unless Im giving her an order Oh sorry I say I was supposed to get those back to Cinna Im sorry Can you take them to him She avoids my eyes gives a small nod and heads out the door Id set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner But I know that my apology runs much deeper That Im ashamed I never tried to help her in the woods That I let the Capitol kill the boy and mutilate her without lifting afinger Just like I was watching the Games I kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my clothes The shivering hasnt stopped Perhaps the girl doesnt even remember me But I know she does You dont forget the face of the person who was your last hope I pull the covers up over my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl who cant speak But I can feel her eyes staring at me piercing through walls and doors and bedding I wonder if shell enjoy watching me dieMy slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams The face of the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier Hunger Games with my mother withdrawn and unreachable with Prim emaciated and terrified I bolt up screaming for my father to run as the mineexplodes into a million deadly bits of light Dawn is breaking through the windows The Capitol has a misty haunted air My head aches and I must have bitten into the side of my cheek in the night My tongue probes the ragged flesh and I taste blood Slowly I drag myself out of bed and into the shower I arbitrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hopping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steaming hot water assault me Then Im deluged in lemony foam that I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush Oh well At least my blood is flowing When Im dried and moisturized with lotion I find an outfit has been left for me at the front of the closet Tight black pants a longsleeved burgundy tunic and leather shoes I put my hair in the single braid down my back This is the first time since the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself No fancy hair and clothes no flaming capes Just me Looking like I could be headed for the woods It calms me Haymitch didnt give us an exact time to meet for breaklast and no one has contacted me this morning but Im hungry so I head down to the dining room hoping there will be food Im not disappointed While the table is empty a long board off to the side has been laid with at least twenty dishes A young man an Avox stands at attention by the spread When I ask if I can serve myself he nods assent I load a plate with eggs sausages batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves slices of pale purple melonAs I gorge myself I watch the sun rise over the Capitol I have a second plate of hot grain smothered in beef stew Finally I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate the way Peeta did on the train My mind wanders to my mother and Prim They must be up My mother getting their breakfast of mush Prim milking her goat before school Just two mornings ago I was home Can that be right Yes just two And now how empty the house feels even from a distance What did they say last night about my fiery debut at the Games Did it give them hope or simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twentyfour tributes circled together knowing only one could live Haymitch and Peeta come in bid me good morning fill their plates It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exactly the same outfit I am I need to say something to Cinna This twins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games begin Surely they must know this Then I remember Haymitch telling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do If it was anyone but Cinna I might be tempted to ignore him But after last nights triumph I dont have a lot of room to criticize his choices Im nervous about the training There will be three days in which all the tributes practice together On the last afternoon well each get a chance to perform in private before the Gamemakers The thought of meeting the other tributesfacetoface makes me queasy I turn the roll I have just taken from the basket over and over in my hands but my appetite is gone When Haymitch has finished several platters of stew he pushes back his plate with a sigh He takes a flask from his pocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the table So lets get down to business Training First off if you like Ill coach you separately Decide now Why would you coach us separately I ask Say if you had a secret skill you might not want the other to know about says Haymitch I exchange a look with Peeta I dont have any secret skills he says And I already know what yours is right I mean Ive eaten enough of your squirrels I never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot Somehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and frying them up for himself Not out of greed But because town families usually eat expensive butcher meat Beef and chicken and horse You can coach us together I tell Haymitch Peeta nods All right so give me some idea of what you can do says Haymitch I cant doanything says Peeta Unless you count baking bread Sorry I dont Katniss I already know youre handy with a knife says Haymitch Not really But I can hunt I say With a bow and arrow And youre good asks Haymitch I have to think about it Ive been putting food on the table for four years Thats no small task Im not as good as my father was but hed had more practice Ive better aim than Gale but Ive had more practice Hes a genius with traps and snares Im all right I say Shes excellent says Peeta My father buys her squirrels He always comments on how the arrows never pierce the body She hits every one in the eye Its the same with the rabbits she sells the butcher She can even bring down deer This assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by surprise First that he ever noticed Second that hes talking me up What are you doing I ask him suspiciously What are you doing If hes going to help you he has to know what youre capable of Dont underrate yourself says Peeta I dont know why but this rubs me the wrong way What about you Ive seen you in the market You can lift hundredpound bags of flour I snap at him Tell him that Thats not nothing Yes and Im sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for me to chuck at people Its not like being able to use a weapon You know it isnt he shoots back He can wrestle I tell Haymitch He came in second in our school competition last year only after his brother What use is that How many times have you seen someone wrestle someone to death says Peeta in disgust Theres always handtohand combat All you need is to come up with a knife and youll at least stand a chance If I get jumped Im dead I can hear my voice rising in anger But you wont Youll be living up in some tree eating raw squirrels and picking off people with arrows You know what my mother said to me when she came to saygoodbye as if to cheer me up she says maybe District Twelve will finally have a winner Then I realized she didnt mean me she meant you bursts out Peeta Oh she meant you I say with a wave of dismissal She said Shes a survivor that one She is says Peeta That pulls me up short Did his mother really say that about me Did she rate me over her son I see the pain in Peetas eyes and know he isnt lying Suddenly Im behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of the rain running down my back the hollowness in my belly I sound eleven years old when I speak But only because someone helped me Peetas eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands and Iknow he remembers that day too But he just shrugs People will help you in the arena Theyll be tripping over each other to sponsor you No more than you I say Peeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch She has no idea The effect she can have He runs his fingernail along the wood grain in the table refusing to look at me What on earth does he mean People help me When we were dying of starvation no one helped me No one except Peeta Once I had something to barter with things changed Im a tough trader Or am I What effect do I have That Im weak and needy Is he suggesting that I got good deals because people pitied me I try to think if this is true Perhaps some of the merchants were a little generous in their trades but I always attributed that to their longstanding relationship with my father Besides my game is firstclass No one pitied me I glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me After about a minute of this Haymitch says Well then Well well well Katniss theres no guarantee theyll be bows and arrows in the arena but during your private session with the Gamemakers show them what you can do Until then stay clear of archery Are you any good at trapping I know a few basic snares I mutter That may be significant in terms of food says Haymitch And Peeta shes right never  underestimate strength in the arena Very often physical power tilts the advantage to a player In the Training Center they will have weights but dont reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tributes The plans the same for both of you You go to group training Spend the time trying to learn something you dont know Throw a spear Swing a mace Learn to tie a decent knot Save showing what youre best at until your private sessions Are we clear says Haymitch Peeta and I nod One last thing In public I want you by each others side every minute says Haymitch We both start to object but Haymitch slams his hand on the table Every minute Its not open for discussion You agreed to do as I said You will be together you will appear amiable to each other Now get out Meet Effie at the elevator at ten for training I bite my lip and stalk back to my room making sure Peeta can hear the door slam I sit on the bed hating Haymitch hating Peeta hating myself for mentioningthat day long ago in the rain Its such a joke Peeta and I going along pretending to be friends Talking up each others strengths insisting the other take credit for their abilities Because in fact at some point were going to have to knock it off and acceptwere bitter adversaries Which Id be prepared to do right now if it wasnt for Haymitchs stupid instruction that we stick together in training Its my own fault I guess for telling him he didnt have to coach us separately But that didnt mean I wanted to do everything with Peeta Who by the way clearly doesnt want to be partnering up with me either I hear Peetas voice in my head She has no idea The effect she can have Obviously meant to demean me Right but a tiny part of me wonders if this was a compliment That he meant I was appealing in some way Its weird how much hes noticed me Like the attention hes paid to my hunting And apparently I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined either The flour The wrestling I have kept track of the boy with the bread Its almost ten I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair again Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about meeting the other tributes but now I can feel my anxiety rising again By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator I catch myself biting my nails I stop at once The actual training rooms are below ground level of our building With these elevators the ride is less than a minute The doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with various weapons and obstacle courses Although its not yet ten were the last ones to arrive The other tributes are gathered in a tense circle They each have a cloth square with their district number on it pinned to their shirts While someone pins the number  on my back I do a quick assessment Peeta and I are the only two dressed alike As soon as we join the circle the head trainer a tall athletic woman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the training schedule Experts in each skill will remain at their stations We will be free to travel from area to area as we choose per our mentors instructions Some of the stations teach survival skills others fighting techniques We are forbidden to engage in any combative exercise with another tribute There are assistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner When Atala begins to read down the list of the skill stations my eyes cant help flitting around to the other tributes Its the first time weve been assembled on level ground in simple clothes My heart sinks Almost all of the boys and at least half of the girls are bigger than I am even though many of the tributes have never been fed properly You can see it in their bones their skin the hollow look in their eyes I may be smaller naturally but overall my familys resourcefulness has given me an edge in that area I stand straight and while Im thin Im strong Themeat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it tookto get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me The exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts the volunteers the ones who have been fed and trained throughout their lives for this moment The tributes from   and  traditionally have this look about them Its technically against the rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it happens every year In District  we call them the Career Tributes or just the Careers And like as not the winner will be one of them The slight advantage I held coming into the Training Center my fiery entrance last night seems to vanish in the presence of my competition The other tributes were jealous of us but not because we were amazing because our stylists were Now I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career Tributes Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me They project arrogance and brutality When Atala releases us they head straight for the deadliestlooking weapons in the gym and handle them with ease Im thinking that its lucky Im a fast runner when Peeta nudges my arm and I jump He is still beside me per Haymitchs instructionsHis expression is sober Where would you like to start I look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off clearly trying to intimidate the field Then at the others the underfed the incompetent shakily having their first lessons with a knife or an ax Suppose we tie some knots I say Right you are says Peeta We cross to an empty station where the trainer seems pleased to have students You get the feeling that the knottying class is not the Hunger games hot spot When he realizes I know something about snares he shows us a simple excellent trap that will leave a human competitor dangling by a leg from a tree We concentrate on this one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it Then we move on to camouflage Peeta genuinely seems to enjoy this station swirling a combination of mud and clay and berry juices around on his pale skin weaving disguises from vines and leaves The trainer who runs the camouflage station is full of enthusiasm at his work I do the cakes he admits to me The cakes I ask Ive been preoccupied with watching the boy from District  send a spear through a dummys heart from fifteen yards What cakes At home The iced ones for the bakery he says He means the ones they display in the windows Fancy cakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting Theyre for birthdaysand New Years Day When were in the square Prim always drags me over to admire them although wed never be able to afford one Theres little enough beauty in District  though so I can hardly deny her this I look more critically at the design on Peetas arm The alternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling through the leaves in the woods I wonder how he knows this since I doubt hes ever been beyond the fence Has he been able to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his backyard Somehow the whole thing his skill those inaccessible cakes the praise of the camouflage expert annoys me Its lovely If only you could frost someone to death I say Dont be so superior You can never tell what youll find in the arena Say its actually a gigantic cake begins Peeta Say we move on I break in So the next three days pass with Peeta and I going quietly from station to station We do pick up some valuable skills from starting fires to knife throwing to making shelter Despite Haymitchs order to appear mediocre Peeta excels in handtohand combat and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though wanting to save those for our private sessions The Gamemakers appeared early on the first day Twenty or so men and women dressed in deep purple robes They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium sometimes wandering about to watch us jotting down notes other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them ignoring the lot of us But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District  tributes Several times Ive looked up to find one fixated on me They consult with the trainers during our meals as well We see them all gathered together when we come back Breakfast and dinner are served on our floor but at lunch the twentyfour of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium Food is arranged on carts around the room and you serve yourself The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around one table as if to prove their superiority that they have no fear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice Most of the other tributes sit alone like lost sheep No one says a word to us Peeta and I eat together and since Haymitch keeps dogging us about it try to keep up a friendly conversation during the meals Its not easy to find a topic Talking of home is painful Talking of the present unbearable One day Peeta empties our breadbasket and points out how they have been careful toinclude types from the districts along with the refined bread of the Capitol The fishshaped loaf tinted green with seaweed from District  The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from District  Somehow although its made from the same stuff it looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that are the standard fare at home And there you have it says Peeta scooping the breads back in the basket You certainly know a lot I say Only about bread he says Okay now laugh as if Ive said something funny We both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the stares from around the room All right Ill keep smiling pleasantly and you talk says Peeta Its wearing us both out Haymitchs direction to be friendly Because ever since I slammed my door theres been a chill in the air between us But we have our orders Did I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear Iask No but it sounds fascinating says Peeta I try and animate my face as I recall the event a true story in which Id foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights to a beehive Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue Hes much better at this than I am On the second day while were taking a shot at spear throwing he whispers to me I think we have a shadow I throw my spear which Im not too bad at actually if I dont have to throw too far and see the little girl from District  standing back a bit watching us Shes the twelveyearold the one who reminded me so of Prim in stature Up close she looks about ten She has bright dark eyes and satiny brown skin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly extended to her sides as if ready to take wing at the slightest sound Its impossible not to think of a bird I pick up another spear while Peeta throws I think her names Rue he says softly I bite my lip Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the Meadow Rue Primrose Neither of them could tip the scale at seventy pounds soaking wet What can we do about it I ask him more harshly than I intended Nothing to do he says back Just making conversation Now that I know shes there its hard to ignore the child She slips up and joins us at different stations Like me shes clever with plants climbs swiftly and has good aim She can hit the target every time with a slingshot But what is a slingshot against a pound male with a sword Back on the District  floor Haymitch and Effie grill us throughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the day What we did who watched us how the other tributes size upCinna and Portia arent around so theres no one to add any sanity to the meals Not that Haymitch and Effie are fighting anymore Instead they seem to be of one mind determined to whip us into shape Full of endless directions about what we should do and not do in training Peeta is more patient but I become fed up and surly When we finally escape to bed on the second night Peeta mumbles Someone ought to get Haymitch a drink I make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a laugh Then catch myself Its messing with my mind too much trying to keep straight when were supposedly friends and when were not At least when we get into the arena Ill know where we stand Dont Dont lets pretend when theres no one around All right Katniss he says tiredly After that we only talk in front of people On the third day of training they start to call us out of lunch for our private sessions with the Gamemakers District by district first the boy then the girl tribute As usual District  is slated to go last We linger in the dining room unsure where else to go No one comes back once they have left As the room empties the pressure to appear friendly lightens By the time they call Rue we are left alone We sit in silence until they summon Peeta He rises Remember what Haymitch saidabout being sure to throw the weights The words come out of my mouth without permission Thanks I will he says You    Shoot straight I nod I dont know why I said anything at all Although if Im going to lose Id rather Peeta win than the others Better for our district for my mother and Prim After about fifteen minutes they call my name I smooth my hair set my shoulders back and walk into the gymnasium Instantly I know Im in trouble Theyve been here too long the Gamemakers Sat through twentythree other demonstrations Had too much to wine most of them Want more than anything to go home Theres nothing I can do but continue with the plan I walk to the archery station Oh the weapons Ive been itching to get my hands on them for days Bows made of wood and plastic and metal and materials I cant even name Arrows with feathers cut in flawless uniform lines I choose a bow string it and sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder Theres a shooting range but its much too limited Standard bullseyes and human silhouettes I walk to the center of the gymnasium and pick my first target The dummy used for knife practice Even as I pull back on the bow I know something is wrong The strings tighter than the one I use at home The arrows more rigid I missthe dummy by a couple of inches and lose what little attention I had been commanding For a moment Im humiliated then I head back to the bullseye I shoot again and again until I get the feel of these new weapons Back in the center of the gymnasium I take my initial position and skewer the dummy right through the heart Then I sever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing and the bag splits open as it slams to the ground Without pausing I shoulderroll forward come up on one knee and send an arrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium floor A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture Its excellent shooting I turn to the Gamemakers A few are nodding approval but the majority of them are fixated on a roast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table Suddenly I am furious that with my life on the line they dont even have the decency to pay attention to me That Im being upstaged by a dead pig My heart starts to pound I can feel my face burning Without thinking I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers table I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back The arrow skewers the apple in the pigs mouth and pins it to the wall behind it Everyone stares at me in disbelief Thank you for your consideration I say Then I give a slight bow and walkstraight toward the exit without being dismissedAs I stride toward the elevator I fling my bow to one side and my quiver to the other I brush past the gaping Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button with my fist The doors slide together and I zip upward I actually make it back to my floor before the tears start running down mycheeks I can hear the others calling me from the sitting room but I fly down the hall into my room bolt the door and fling myself onto my bed Then I really begin to sob Now Ive done it Now Ive ruined everything If Id stood even a ghost of chance it vanished when I sent that arrow flying at the Gamemakers What will they do to me now Arrest me Execute me Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so I can wait on the future tributes of Panem What was I thinking shooting at the Gamemakers Of course I wasnt I was shooting at that apple because I was so angryat being ignored I wasnt trying to kill one of them If I were theyd be dead Oh what does it matter Its not like I was going to win the Games anyway Who cares what they do to me What really scares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim how my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness Will they take their few belongings or send my mother to prison and Prim to the community home or kill them They wouldnt kill them would they Why not What do they care I should have stayed and apologized Or laughed like it was a big joke Then maybe I would have found some leniency But instead I stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful manner possible Haymitch and Effie are knocking on my door I shout for them to go away and eventually they do It takes at least an hour for me to cry myself out Then I just lay curled up on the bed stroking the silken sheets watching the sun set over the artificial candy Capitol At first I expect guards to come for me But as time passes it seems less likely I calm down They still need a girl tribute from District  dont they If the Gamemakers want to punish me they can do it publicly Wait until Im in the arena and sic starving wild animals on me You can bet theyll make sure I dont have a bow and arrow to defend myself Before that though theyll give me a score so low no one in their right mind would sponsor me Thats what will happen tonight Since the training isnt open to viewers the Gamemakers announce a score for each player It gives the audience a starting place for the betting that will continue throughout the Games The number which is between one and twelve one being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably high signifies the promise of the tribute The mark is not a guarantee of which person will win Its only an indication of the potential a tribute showed in training Often because of the variables in the actual arena highscoring tributes go down almost immediately And a few years ago the boy who won the Games only received a three Still the scores can help or hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship I had been hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven even if Im not particularly powerful Now Im sure Ill have the lowest score of the twentyfour If no one sponsors me my odds of staying alive decrease to almost zero When Effie taps on the door tocall me to dinner I decide I may as well go The scores will be televised tonight Its not like I can hide what happened forever I go to the bathroom and wash my facebut its still red and splotchy Everyones waiting at the table even Cinna and Portia I wish the stylists hadnt shown up because for some reason I dont like the idea of disappointing them Its as if Ive thrown away all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies without a thought I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny spoonfuls of fish soup The saltiness reminds me of my tears The adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast and I let my eyes meet Peetas He raises his eyebrows A question What happened I just give my head a small shake Then as theyre serving the main course I hear Haymitch say Okay enough small talk just how bad were you today Peeta jumps in I dont know that it mattered By the time I showed up no one even bothered to look at me They were singing some kind of drinking song I think So I threw around some heavy objects until they told me I could go That makes me feel a bit better Its not like Peeta attacked the Gamemakers but at least he was provoked too And you sweetheart says Haymitch Somehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off enough that Im at least able to speak I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers Everyone stops eating You what The horror in Effies voice confirms my worse suspicions I shot an arrow at them Not exactly at them In their direction Its like Peeta said I was shooting and they were ignoring me and I just    I just lost my head so I shot an apple out of their stupid roast pigs mouth I say defiantly And what did they say says Cinna carefully Nothing Or I dont know I walked out after that I say Without being dismissed gasps Effie I dismissed myself I said I remember how I promised Prim that I really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal has dropped on me Well thats that says Haymitch Then he butters a roll Do you think theyll arrest me I ask Doubt it Be a pain to replace you at this stage says Haymitch What about my family I say Will they punish them Dont think so Wouldnt make much sense See theyd have to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to have any worthwhile effect on the population People would need to know what you did But they cant since its secret so itd be a waste of effort says Haymitch More likely theyll make your life hell in the arena Well theyve already promised to do that to us any way says Peeta Very true says Haymitch And I realize the impossible has happened They have actually cheered me up Haymitch picks up a pork chop with his fingers which makes Effie frown and dunks it in his wine He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to chuckleWhat were their faces like I can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up Shocked Terrified Uh ridiculous some of them An image pops into my mind One man trippedbackward into a bowl of punch Haymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie although even she is suppressing a smile Well it serves them right Its their job to pay attention to you And just because you come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you Then her eyes dart around as if shes said something totally outrageous Im sorry but thats what I think she says to no one in particular Ill get a very bad score I say Scores only matter if theyre very good no one pays much attention to the bad or mediocre ones For all they know you could be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose People use that strategy said Portia I hope thats how people interpret the four Ill probably get says Peeta If that Really is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards One almost landed on my foot I grin at him and realize that Im starving I cut off a piece of pork dunk it in mashed potatoes and start eating Its okay My family is safe And if they are safe no real harm has been done After dinner we go to sitting room to watch the scores announced on television First they show a photo of the tribute then flash their score below it The Career Tributes naturally get in the eighttoten range Most of the other players average a five Surprisingly little Rue comes up with a seven I dont know what she showed the judges but shes so tiny it must have been impressive District  comes up last as usual Peeta pulls an eight so at least a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching him I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up expecting the worst Then theyre flashing the number eleven on the screen Eleven Effie Trinket lets out a squeal and everybody is slapping me on the back and cheering and congratulating me But it doesnt seem real There must be a mistake How    How could that happen I ask Haymitch Guess they liked your temper he says Theyve got a show to put on They need some players with some heat Katniss the girl who was on fire says Cinna and gives me a hug Oh wait until you see your interview dress More flames I ask Of a sort he says mischievously Peeta and I congratulate each other another awkward moment Weve both done well but what does thatmean for the other I escape to my room as quickly as possible and burrow down under the covers The stress of the day particularly the crying has worn me out I drift off reprieved relieved and with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids At dawn I lie in bed for a while watching the sun come up on a beautiful morning Its Sunday A day off at home I wonder if Gale is in the woods yet Usually we devote all of Sunday to stocking up for the week Rising early hunting and gathering then trading at the Hob I think of Gale without me Both of us can hunt alone but were better as a pair Particularly if were trying for bigger game But also in thelittler things having a partner lightened the load could even make the arduous task of filling my familys table enjoyable I had been struggling along on my own for about six months when I first ran into Gale in the woods It was a Sunday in October the air cool and pungent with dying things Id spent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and the slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds harvesting Katniss The only meat Id shot was a squirrel that had practically run over my toes in its quest for acorns but the animals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other food sources Having strayed farther afield than usual I was hurrying back home lugging my burlap sacks when I came across a dead rabbit It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a foot above my head About fifteen yards away was another I recognized the twitchup snares because my father had used them When the prey is caught its yanked into the air out of the reach of other hungry animals Id been trying to use snares all summer with no success so I couldnt help dropping my sacks to examine this one My fingers were just on the wire above one of the rabbits when a voice rang out Thats dangerous I jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from behind a tree He must have been watching me the whole time He was only fourteen but he cleared six feet and was as good as an adult to me Id seen him around the Seam and at school And one other time Hed lost his father in the same blast that killed mine In January Id stood by while he received his medal of valor in the Justice Building another oldest child with no father I remembered his two little brothers clutching his mother a woman whose swollen belly announced she was just days away from giving birth Whats your name he said coming over anddisengaging the rabbit from the snare He had another three hanging from his belt Katniss I said barely audible Well Catnip stealings punishable by death or hadnt you heard he said Katniss I said louder And I wasnt stealing it I just wanted to look at your snare Mine never catch anything He scowled at me not convinced So whered you get the squirrel I shot it I pulled my bow off my shoulder I was still using the small version my father had made me but Id been practicing with the fullsize one when I could I was hoping that by spring I might be able to bring down some bigger game Gales eyes fastened on the bow Can I see that I handed it over Just remember stealings punishable by death That was the first time I ever saw him smile It transformed him from someone menacing to someone you wished you knew But it took several months before I returned that smile We talked hunting then I told him I might be able to get him a bow if he had something to trade Not food I wanted knowledge I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt of fat rabbits in one day He agreed something might be worked out As the seasons went by we grudgingly began to share our knowledge our weapons our secret places that were thick with wild plums or turkeys He taught me snares and fishing I showed him what plants to eat and eventually gave him one of our precious bows And then one day without either of us saying it we became a team Dividing the work and the spoils Making sure that both our families had food Gale gave me a sense of security Id lacked since my fathers death His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods I became a much better hunter when I didnt have to look over my shoulder constantly when someone was watching my back But he turned into so much more than a hunting partner He became my confidante someone with whom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the fence In exchange he trusted me with his Being out in the woods with Gale    Sometimes I was actually happy I call him my friend but in the last year its seemed too casual a word for what Gale is to me A pang of longing shoots through my chest If only he was with me now But of course I dont want that I dont want him in the arena where hed be dead in a few days I just    I just miss him And I hate being so alone Does he miss me He must I think of the eleven flashing under my name last night I know exactly what hed say tome Well theres some room for improvement there And then hed give me a smile and Id return it without hesitating now I cant help comparing what I have with Gale to what Im pretending to have with Peeta How I never question Gales motives while I do nothing but doubt the latters Its not a fair comparison really Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual need to survive Peeta and I know the others survival means our own death How do you sidestep that Effies knocking at the door reminding me theres another big big big day ahead Tomorrow night will be our televised interviews I guess the whole team will have their hands full readying us for that I get up and take a quick shower being a bit more careful about the buttons I hit and head down to the dining room Peeta Effie and Haymitch are huddled around the table talking in hushed voices That seems odd but hunger wins out over curiosity and I load up my plate with breakfast before I join them The stews made with tender chunks of lamb and dried plums today Perfect on the bed of wild rice Ive shoveled about halfway through the mound when I realize no ones talking I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth So whats going on Youre coaching us on interviews today right Thats right says Haymitch You dont have to wait until Im done I can listen and cat at the same time I say Well theres been a change of plans About our current approach says Haymitch Whats that I ask Im not sure what our current approach is Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tributes is the last bit of strategy I remember Haymitch shrugs Peeta has asked to be coachedseparatelyBetrayalThats the first thing I feel which is ludicrous For there to be betrayal there would have had to been trust first Between Peeta and me And trust has not been part of the agreement Were tributes But the boy who risked a beating to give me bread the one who steadied me in the chariot who covered for me with theredheaded Avox girl who insisted Haymitch know my hunting skills    Was there some part of me that couldnt help trusting him On the other hand Im relieved that we can stop the pretense of being friends Obviously whatever thin connection wed foolishly formed has been severed And high time too The Games begin in two days and trust will only be a weakness Whatever triggered Peetas decision and I suspect it had to do with my outperforming him in training I should be nothing but grateful for it Maybe hes finally accepted the fact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are enemies the better Good I say So whats the schedule Youll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and four with me for content says Haymitch You start with Effie Katniss I cant imagine what Effie will have to teach me that could take four hours but shes got me working down to the last minute We go to my rooms and she puts me in a fulllength gown and highheeled shoes not the ones Ill he wearing for the actual interview and instructs me on walking The shoes are the worst part Ive never worn high heels and cant get used to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet But Effie runs around in them fulltime and Im determined that if she can do it so can I The dress poses anotherproblem It keeps tangling around my shoes so of course I hitch it up and then Effie swoops down on me like a hawk smacking my hands and yelling Not above the ankle When I finally conquer walking theres still sitting posture apparently I have a tendency to duck my head eye contact hand gestures and smiling Smiling is mostly about smiling more Effie makes me say a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile while smiling or ending with a smile By lunch the muscles in my cheeks are twitching from overuse Well thats the best I can do Effie says with a sigh Just remember Katniss you want the audience to like you And you dont think they will I ask Not if you glare at them the entire time Why dont you save that for the arena Instead think of yourself among friends says Effie Theyre betting on how long Ill live I burst out Theyre not my friends Well try and pretend snaps Effie Then she composes herself and beams at me See like this Im smiling at you even though youre aggravating me Yes it feels very convincing I say Im going to eat  kick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room hiking my skirt up to my thighs Peeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods so Im thinking the content session should be an improvement over the morning I couldnt be more wrong After lunchHaymitch takes me into thesitting room directs me to the couch and then just frowns at me for a while What I finally ask Im trying to figure out what to do with you he says How were going to present you Are you going to be charming Aloof Fierce So far youre shining like a star You volunteered to save your sister Cinna made you look unforgettable Youve got the top training score People are intrigued but no one knows who you are The impression you make tomorrow will decide exactly what I can get you in terms of sponsors says Haymitch Having watched the tribute interviews all my life I know theres truth to what hes saying If you appeal to the crowd either by being humorous or brutal or eccentric you gain favor Whats Peetas approach Or am I not allowed to ask I say Likable He has a sort of selfdeprecating humor naturally says Haymitch Whereas when you open your mouth you come across more as sullen and hostile I do not I say Please I dont know where you pulled that cheery wavy girl on the chariot from but I havent seen her before or since says Haymitch And youve given me so many reasons to be cheery I counterBut you dont have to please me Im not going to sponsor you So pretend Im the audience says Haymitch Delight me Fine I snarl Haymitch takes the role of the interviewer and I try to answer his questions in a winning fashion But I cant Im too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that I even have to answer the questions All I can think is how unjust the whole thing is the Hunger Games Why am I hopping around like some trained dog trying to please people I hate The longer the interview goes on the more my fury seems to rise to the surface until Im literally spitting out answers at him All right enough he says Weve got to find another angle Not only are you hostile I dont know anything about you Ive asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your life your family what you care about They want to know about you Katniss But I dont want them to Theyre already taking my future They cant have the things that mattered to me in the past I say Then lie Make something up says Haymitch Im not good at lying I say Well you better learn fast Youve got about as much charm as a dead slug says Haymitch Ouch That hurts Even Haymitch must know hes been too harsh because his voice softens Heres an idea Try acting humble Humble I echo That you cant believe a little girl from DistrictTwelve has done this well The whole things been more than you ever could have dreamed of Talk about Cinnas clothes How nice the people are How the city amazes you If you wont talk about yourself at least compliment the audience Just keep turning it back around all right Gush The next hours are agonizing At once its clear I cannot gush We try me playing cocky but I just dont have the arrogance Apparently Im too vulnerable for ferocity Im not witty Funny Sexy Or mysterious By the end of thesession I am no one at all Haymitch started drinking somewhere around witty and a nasty edge has crept into his voice I give up sweetheart Just answer the questions and try not to let the audience see how openly you despise them I have dinner that night in my room ordering an outrageous number of delicacies eating myself sick and then taking out my anger at Haymitch at the Hunger Games at every living being in the Capitol by smashing dishes around my room When the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down my bed her eyes widen at the mess Just leave it I yell at her Just leave it alone I hate her too with her knowing reproachful eyes that call me a coward a monster a puppet of the Capitol both now and then For her justice must finally be happening At least my death will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods But instead of fleeing the room the girl closes the door behind her and goes to the bathroom She comes back with a damp cloth and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood from a broken plate off my hands Why is she doing this Why am I letting her I should have tried to save you I whisper She shakes her head Does this mean we were right to stand by That she has forgiven me No it was wrong I say She taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest I think she means that I would just have ended up an Avox too Probably would have An Avox or dead I spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl clean the room When all the garbage has been dropped down a disposal and the food cleaned away she turns down my bed I crawl in between the sheets like a fiveyearold and let her tuck me in Then she goes I want her to stay until I fall asleep To be there when I wake up I want the protection of this girl even though she never had mine In the morning its not the girl but my prep team who are hanging over me My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are over This day belongs to Cinna Hes my last hope Maybe hecan make me look so wonderful no one will care what comes out of my mouth The team works on me until late afternoon turning my skin to glowing satin stenciling patterns on my arms painting flame designs on my twenty perfect nails Then Venia goes to work on my hair weaving strands of red into a pattern that begins at my left ear wraps around my head and then falls in one braid down my right shoulder They erase my face with a layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out Huge dark eyes full red lips lashes that throw off bits of light when I blink Finally they cover my entire body in a powder that makes me shimmer in gold dust Then Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress but I cant really see it because its covered Close your eyes he orders I can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my naked body then the weight It must be forty pounds I clutch Octavias hand as I blindly step into my shoes glad to find they are at least two inches lower thanthe pair Effie had me practice in Theres some adjusting and fidgeting Then silence Can I open my eyes I ask Yes says Cinna Open them The creature standing before me in the fulllength mirror has come from another world Where skin shimmers and eyes flash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels Because my dress oh my dress is entirely covered in reflective precious gems red and yellow and white with bits of blue that accent the tips of the flame design The slightest movement gives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire I am not pretty I am not beautiful I am as radiant as the sun For a while we all just stare at me Oh Cinna I finally whisper Thank you Twirl for me he says I hold out my arms and spin in a circle The prep team screams in admiration Cinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the dress and shoes which are infinitely more manageable than Effies The dress hangs in such a way that I dont have to lift the skirt when I walk leaving me with one less thing to worry about So all ready for the interview then asks Cinna I can see by his expression that hes been talking to Haymitch That he knows how dreadful I am Im awful Haymitch called me a dead slug No matter what we tried I couldnt do it I just cant be one of those people he wants me to be I say Cinna thinks about this a moment Why dont you just be yourself Myself Thats no good either Haymitch says Im sullen and hostile I say Well you are    Around Haymitch says Cinna with a grin I dont find you so Theprep team adores you You even won over the Gamemakers And as for the citizens of the Capitol well they cant stop talking about you No one can help but admire your spirit My spirit This is a new thought Im not sure exactly what it means but it suggests Im a fighter In a sort of brave way Its not as if Im never friendly Okay maybe I dont go around loving everybody I meet maybe my smiles are hard to come by but I do care for some people Cinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones Suppose when you answer the questions you think youre addressing a friend back home Who would your best friend be asks Cinna Gale I say instantly Only it doesnt make sense Cinna I would never be telling Gale those things about me He already knows them What about me Could you think of me as a friend asks Cinna Of all the people Ive met since I left home Cinna is by far my favorite I liked him right off and he hasnt disappointed me yet I think so but Ill be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists Youll be able to look right at me When youre asked a question find me and answer it as honestly as possible says Cinna Even if what I think is horrible I ask Because it might be really Especially if what you think is horrible says Cinna Youll try it I nod Its a plan Or at least a straw to grasp atToo soon its time to go The interviews take place on a stage constructed in front of theTraining Center Once I leave my room it will be only minutes until Im in front of the crowd the cameras all of Panem As Cinna turns the doorknob I stop his hand Cinna    Im completely overcome with stage fright Remember they already love you he says gently Just be yourself We meet up with the rest of the District  crowd at the elevator Portia and her gang have been hard at work Peeta looks striking in a black suit with flame accents While we look well together its a relief not to be dressed identically Haymitch and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion I avoid Haymitch but accept Effies compliments Effie can be tiresome and clueless but shes not destructive like Haymitch When the elevator opens the other tributes are being lined up to take the stage All twentyfour of us sit in a big arc throughout the interviews Ill be last or second to last since the girl tribute precedes the boy from each district How I wish I could be first and get the whole thing out of the way Now Ill have to listen to how witty funny humble fierce and charming everybodyelse is before I go up Plus the audience will start to get bored just as the Gamemakers did And I cant exactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention Right before we parade onto the stage Haymitch comes up behind Peeta and me and growls Remember youre still a happy pair So act like it What I thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for separate coaching But I guess that was a private not a public thing Anyway theres not much chance for interaction now as we walk singlefile to our seats and take our places Just stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and shallow I can feel my pulse pounding in my temples Its a relief to get to my chair because between the heels and my legs shaking Im afraid Ill trip Although evening is falling the City Circle is brighter than a summers day An elevated seating unit has been set up for prestigious guests with the stylists commanding the front row The cameras will turn to them when the crowd is reacting to their handiwork A large balcony off a building to the right has been reserved for the Gamemakers Television crews have claimed most of the other balconies But the City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are completely packed with people Standing room only At homes and community halls around the country every television set is turned on Every citizen of Panem is tuned in There will be no blackouts tonight Caesar Flickerman the man who has hosted the interviews for more than forty years bounces onto the stage Its a little scary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged during all that time Same face under a coating of pure white makeup Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each Hunger Games Same ceremonial suit midnight blue dotted with a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars They do surgery in the Capitol to make people appearyounger and thinner In District  looking old is something of an achievement since so many people die early You see an elderly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity ask the secret of survival A plump person is envied because they arent scraping by like the majority of us But here it is different Wrinkles arent desirable A round belly isnt a sign of success This year Caesars hair is powder blue and his eyelids and lips are coated in the same hue He looks freakish but less frightening than he did last year when his color was crimson and he seemed to bebleeding Caesar tells a few jokes to warm up the audience but then gets down to business The girl tribute from District  looking provocative in a seethrough gold gown steps up the center of the stage to join Caesar for her interview You can tell her mentor didnt have any trouble coming up with an angle for her With that flowing blonde hair emerald green eyes her body tall and lush    Shes sexy all the way Each interview only lasts three minutes Then a buzzer goes off and the next tribute is up Ill say this for Caesar he really does his best to make the tributes shine Hes friendly tries to set the nervous ones at ease laughs at lame jokes and can turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he reacts I sit like a lady the way Effie showed me as the districts slip by    Everyone seems to be playing up some angle The monstrous boy from District  is a ruthless killing machine The foxfaced girl from District  sly and elusive I spotted Cinna as soon as he took his place but even his presence cannot relax me    The crippled boy from  is very quiet My palms are sweating like crazy but the jeweled dress isnt absorbent and they skid right of if I try to dry them  Rue who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with wings flutters her way to Caesar A hush falls over the crowd at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute Caesars very sweet with her complimenting her seven in training an excellent score for one so small When he asks her what her greatest strength in the arena will be she doesnt hesitate Im very hard to catch she says in a tremulous voice And if they cant catch me they cant kill me So dont count me out I wouldnt in a million years says Caesar encouragingly The boy tribute from District  Thresh has the same dark skin as Rue but the resemblance stops there Hes one of the giants probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox but I noticed he rejected the invitations from the Career Tributes to join their crowd Instead hes been very solitary speaking to no one showing little interest in training Even so he scored a ten and its not hard to imagine he impressed the Gamemakers He ignores Caesars attempts at banter and answers with a yes or no or just remains silent If only I was his size I could get away with sullen and hostile and it would be just fine I bet half thesponsors are at least considering him If I had any money Id bet on him myself And then theyre calling Katniss Everdeen and I feel myself as if in a dreamstanding and making my way center stage I shake Caesars outstretched hand and he has the good grace not to immediately wipe his off on his suit So Katniss the Capitol must be quite a change from District Twelve Whats impressed you most since you arrived here asks Caesar What What did he say Its as if the words make no sense My mouth has gone as dry as sawdust I desperately find Cinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him I imagine the words coming from his lips Whats impressed you most since you arrived here I rack my brain for something that made me happy here Be honest I think Be honest The lamb stew I get out Caesar laughs and vaguely I realize some of the audience has joined in The one with the dried plums asks Caesar I nod Oh I eat it by the bucketful He turns sideways to the audience in horror hand on his stomach It doesnt show does it They shout reassurances to him and applaud This is what I mean about Caesar He tries to help you out Now Katniss he says confidentially When you came out in the opening ceremonies my heart actually stopped What did you think of that costume Cinna raises one eyebrow at me Be honest You mean after I got over my fear of being burned alive I ask Big laugh A real one from the audience Yes Start then says Caesar Cinna my friend I should tell him anyway I thought Cinna was brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume Id ever seen and I couldnt believe I was wearing it I cant believe Im wearing this either I lift up my skirt to spread it out I mean look at it As the audience oohs and ahs I see Cinna make the tiniest circular motion with his finger But I know what hes saying Twirl for me I spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate Oh do that again says Caesar and so I lift up my arms and spin around and around letting the skirt fly out letting the dress engulf me in flames The audience breaks into cheers When I stop I clutch Caesars arm Dont stop he says I have to Im dizzy Im also giggling which I think Ive done maybe never in my lifetime But the nerves and the spinning have gotten to me Caesar wraps a protective arm around me Dont worry Ive got you Cant have you following in your mentors footsteps Everyones hooting as the cameras find Haymitch who is by now famous for his head dive at the reaping and he waves them away goodnaturedly and points back to me Its all right Caesar reassures the crowd Shes safe with me So how about that training score Eleven Give us a hint what happened in there I glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip Um    All I can say is Ithink it was a first The cameras are right on the Gamemakers who are chuckling and nodding Youre killing us says Caesar as if in actual pain Details Details I address thebalcony Im not supposed to talk about it right The Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out Shes not Thank you I say Sorry My lips are sealed Lets go back then to the moment they called your sisters name at the reaping says Caesar His mood is quieter now And you volunteered Can you tell us about her No No not all of you But maybe Cinna I dont think Im imagining the sadness on his face Her names Prim Shes just twelve And I love her more than anything You could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now What did she say to you After the reaping Caesar asks Be honest Be honest I swallow hard She asked me to try really hard to win The audience is frozen hanging on my every word And what did you say prompts Caesar gently But instead of warmth I feel an icy rigidity take over my body My muscles tense as they do before a kill When I speak my voice seems to have dropped an octave I swore I would I bet you did says Caesar giving me a squeeze The buzzer goes off Sorry were out of time Best of luck Katniss Everdeen tribute from District Twelve The applause continues long after Im seated I look to Cinna for reassurance He gives me a subtle thumbsup Im still in a daze for the first part of Peetas interview He has the audience from the getgo though I can hear them laughing shouting out He plays up the bakers son thing comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts Then has a funny anecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers Tell me do I still smell like roses he asks Caesar and then theres a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other that brings down the house Im coming back into focus when Caesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home Peeta hesitates then gives an unconvincing shake of his head Handsome lad like you There must be some special girl Come on whats her name says Caesar Peeta sighs Well there is this one girl Ive had a crush on her ever since I can remember But Im pretty sure she didnt know I was alive until the reaping Sounds of sympathy from the crowd Unrequited love they can relate to She have another fellow asks Caesar I dont know but a lot of boys like her says Peeta So heres what you do You win you go home She cant turn you down then eh says Caesarencouragingly I dont think its going to work out Winning    Wont help in my case says Peeta Why ever not says Caesar mystified Peeta blushes beet red and stammers out Because    Because    She came here with mePART IITHE GAMESFor a moment the cameras hold on Peetas downcast eyes as what he says sinks in Then I can see my face mouth half open in a mix of surprise and protest magnified on every screen as I realize Me He means me I press my lips together and stare at the floor hoping this will conceal the emotions starting to boil up inside of me Oh that is a piece of bad luck says Caesar and theres a real edge of pain in his voice The crowd is murmuring in agreement a few have even given agonized cries Its not good agrees Peeta Well I dont think any of us can blame you Itd be hard not to fall for that young lady says Caesar She didnt know Peeta shakes his head Not until now I allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable Wouldnt you love to pull her back out here and get a response Caesar asks the audience The crowd screams assent Sadly rules are rules and Katniss Everdeens time has been spent Well best of luck to you Peeta Mellark and I think I speak for all of Panem when I say our hearts go with yours The roar of the crowd is deafening Peeta has absolutely wiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love for me When the audience finally settles down he chokes out a quiet Thank you and returns to his seat We stand for the anthem I have to raise my head out of the required respect and cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated by a shot of Peeta and me separated by a few feet that in the viewers heads can never be breached Poor tragic us But I know better After the anthem the tributes file back into the Training Center lobby and onto the elevators I make sure to veer into a car that does not contain Peeta The crowd slows our entourages of stylists and mentors and chaperones so we have only each other for company No one speaks My elevator stops to deposit four tributes before I am alone and then find the doors opening on the twelfth floor Peeta has only just stepped from his car whenI slam my palms into his chest He loses his balance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers The urn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces Peeta lands in the shards and blood immediately flows from his hands What was that for he says aghast You had no right No right to go saying those things about me I shout at him Now the elevators open and the whole crew is there Effie Haymitch Cinna and Portia Whats going on says Effie a note of hysteria in her voice Did you fall After she shoved me says Peeta as Effie and Cinna help him up Haymitch turns on me Shoved him This was your idea wasnt it Turning me into some kind of fool in front of the entire country I answer It was my idea says Peeta wincing as he pulls spikes of pottery from his palms Haymitch just helped me with it Yes Haymitch is very helpful To you I say You are a fool Haymitch says in disgust Do you think he hurt you That boy just gave yousomething you could never achieve on your own He made me look weak I say He made you look desirable And lets face it you can use all the help you can get in that department You were about as romantic as dirt until he said he wanted youNow they all do Youre all theyre talking about The starcrossed lovers from District Twelve says Haymitch But were not starcrossed lovers I say Haymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall Who cares Its all a big show Its all how youre perceived The most I could say about you after your interview was that you were nice enough although that in itself was a small miracle Now I can say youre a heartbreaker Oh oh oh how the boys back home fall longingly at your feet Which do you think will get you more sponsors The smell of wine on his breath makes me sick I shove his hands off my shoulders and step away trying to clear my head Cinna comes over and puts his arm around me Hes right Katniss I dont know what to think I should have been told so I didnt look so stupid No your reaction was perfect If youd known it wouldnt have read as real says Portia Shes just worried about her boyfriend says Peeta gruffly tossing away a bloody piece of the urn My cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale I dont have a boyfriend Whatever says Peeta But I bet hes smart enough to know a bluff when he sees it Besides you didnt say you loved me So what does it matter The words are sinking in My anger fading Im torn now between thinking Ive been used and thinking Ive been given anedge Haymitch is right I survived my interview but what was I really A silly girl spinning in a sparkling dress Giggling The only moment of any substance I hail was when I talked about Prim Compare that with Thresh his silent deadly power and Im forgettable Silly and sparkly and forgettable No not entirely forgettable I have my eleven in training But now Peeta has made me an object of love Not just his To hear him tell it I have many admirers And if the audience really thinks were in love    I remember how strongly they responded to his confession Starcrossed lovers Haymitch is right they eat that stuff up in the Capitol Suddenly Im worried that I didnt react properly After he said he loved me did you think I could be in love with him too I ask I did says Portia The way you avoided looking at the cameras the blush They others chime in agreeing Youre golden sweetheart Youre going to have sponsors lined up around the block says Haymitch Im embarrassed about my reaction I force myself to acknowledge Peeta Im sorry I shoved you Doesnt matter he shrugs Although its technically illegal Are your hands okay I ask Theyll be all right he says In the silence that follows delicious smells of our dinner waft in from the dining room Come on lets eat says Haymitch We all follow him to the table andtake our places But then Peeta is bleeding too heavily and Portialeads him off for medical treatment We start the cream and rosepetal soup without them By the time weve finished theyre back Peetas hands are wrapped in bandages I cant help feeling guilty Tomorrow we will be in the arena He has done me a favor and I have answered with an injury Will I never stop owing him After dinner we watch the replay in the sitting room I seem frilly and shallow twirling and giggling in my dress although the others assure me I am charming Peeta actually is charming and then utterly winning as the boy in love And there I am blushing and confused made beautiful by Cinnas hands desirable by Peetas confession tragic by circumstance and by all accounts unforgettable When the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark a hush falls on the room Tomorrow at dawn we will be roused and prepared for the arena The actual Games dont start until ten because so many of the Capitol residents rise late But Peeta and I must make an early start There is no telling how far we will travel to the arena that has been prepared for this years Games I know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us As soon as they leavehere theyll be at the Games Headquarters hopefully madly signing up our sponsors working out a strategy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us Cinna and Portia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be launched into the arena Still final goodbyes must be said here Effie takes both of us by the hand and with actual tears in her eyes wishes us well Thanks us for being the best tributes it has ever been her privilege to sponsor And then because its Effie and shes apparently required by law to say something awful she adds I wouldnt be at all surprised if I finally get promoted to a decent district next year Then she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out overcome with either the emotional parting or the possible improvement of her fortunes Haymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over Any final words of advice asks Peeta When the gong sounds get the hell out of there Youre neither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia Just clear out put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others and find a source of water he says Got it And after that I ask Stay alive says Haymitch Its the same advice he gave us on the train but hes not drunk and laughing this time And we only nod What else is there to say When I head to my room Peeta lingers totalk to Portia Im glad Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can wait until tomorrow My covers are drawn back but there is no sign of the redheaded Avox girl I wish I knew her name I should have asked it She could write it down maybe Or act it out But perhaps that would only result in punishment for her I take a shower and scrub the gold paint the makeup the scent of beauty from my body All that remains of the designteams efforts are the flames on my nails I decide tokeep them as reminder of who I am to the audience Katniss the girl who was on fire Perhaps it will give me something to hold on to in the days to come I pull on a thick fleecy nightgown and climb into bed It takes me about five seconds to realize Ill never fall asleep And I need sleep desperately because in the arena every moment I give in to fatigue will be an invitation to death Its no good One hour two three pass and my eyelids refuse to get heavy I cant stop trying to imagine exactly what terrain Ill be thrown into Desert Swamp A frigid wasteland Above all I am hoping for trees which may afford me some means of concealment and food and shelter Often there are trees because barren landscapes are dull and the Games resolve tooquickly without them But what will the climate be like What traps have the Gamemakers hid den to liven up the slower moments And then there are my fellow tributes    The more anxious I am to find sleep the more it eludes me Finally I am too restless to even stay in bed I pace the floor heart beating too fast breathing too short My room feels like a prison cell If I dont get air soon Im going to start to throw things again I run down the hall to the door to the roof Its not only unlocked but ajar Perhaps someone forgot to close it but it doesnt matter The energy field enclosing the roof prevents any desperate form of escape And Im not looking to escape only to fill my lungs with air I want to see the sky and the moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me The roof is not lit at night but as soon as my bare feel reach its tiled surface I see his silhouette black against the lights that shine endlessly in the Capitol Theres quite a commotion going on down in the streets music and singing and car horns none of which I could hear through the thick glass window panels in my room I could slip away now without him noticing me he wouldnt hear me over the din But the night airs so sweet I cant bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room And what difference does it make Whether we speak ornot My feet move soundlessly across the tiles Im only yard behind him when I say You should be getting some sleep He starts but doesnt turn I can see him give his head a slight shake I didnt want to miss the party Its for us after all I come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail The wide streets are full of dancing people I squint to make out their tiny figures in more detail Are they in costumes Who could tell Peeta answers With all the crazy clothes they wear here Couldnt sleep either Couldnt turn my mind off I say Thinking about your family he asks No I admit a bit guiltily All I can do is wonder about tomorrow Which is pointless of course In the light from below I can see his face now the awkward way he holds his bandaged hands I really am sorry about your hands It doesnt matter Katniss he says Ive never been a contender in theseGames anyway Thats no way to be thinking I say Why not Its true My best hope is to not disgrace myself and    He hesitates And what I say I dont know how to say it exactly Only    I want to die as myself Does that make any sense he asks I shake my head How could he die as anyone but himself I dont want them to changeme in there Turn me into some kind of monster that Im not I bite my lip feeling inferior While Ive been ruminating on the availability of trees Peeta has been struggling with how to maintain his identity His purity of self Do you mean you wont kill anyone I ask No when the time comes Im sure Ill kill just like everybody else I cant go down without a fight Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to    To show the Capitol they dont own me That Im more than just a piece in their Games says Peeta But youre not I say None of us are Thats how the Games work Okay but within that framework theres still you theres still me he insists Dont you see A little Only    No offense but who cares Peeta I say I do I mean what else am I allowed to care about at this point he asks angrily Hes locked those blue eyes on mine now demanding an answer I take a step back Care about what Haymitch said About staying alive Peeta smiles at me sad and mocking Okay Thanks for the tip sweetheart Its like a slap in the face His use of Haymitchs patronizing endearment Look if you want to spend the last hours of your life planning some noble death in the arena thats your choice I want to spend mine in District Twelve Wouldnt surprise me if you do says Peeta Give my mother my best when you make it back will youCount on it I say Then I turn and leave the roof I spend the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze imagining the cutting remarks I will make to Peeta Mellark in the morning Peeta Mellark We will see how high and mighty he is when hes faced with life and death Hell probably turn into one of those raging beast tributes the kind who tries to eat someones heart after theyve killed them There was a guy like that a few years ago from District  called Titus He went completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players hed killed before he ate them There are no rules in the arena but cannibalism doesnt play well with the Capitol audience so they tried to head it off There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic I dont see Peeta in the morning Cinna comes to me before dawn gives me a simple shift to wear and guides me to the roof My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the catacombs under the arena itself A hovercraft appears out of thin air just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the redheaded Avox girl captured and a ladder drops down I place my hands and feet on the lowerrungs and instantly its as if Im frozen Some sort of current glues me to the ladder while Im lifted safely inside I expect the ladder to release me then but Im still stuck when a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe This is just your tracker Katniss The stiller you are the more efficiently I can place it  she says Still Im a statue But that doesnt prevent me from feeling the sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking device deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm Now the Gamemakers will always be able to trace my whereabouts in the arena Wouldnt want to lose a tribute As soon as the trackers in place the ladder releases me The woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof An Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where breakfast has been laid out Despite the tension in my stomach I eat as much as I can although none of the delectable food makes any impression on me Im so nervous I could be eating coal dust The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the windows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness beyond This is what birds see Only theyre free and safe The very opposite of me The ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black out suggesting that were nearing the arena The hovercraft lands and Cinna and I go backto the ladder only this time it leads down into a tube underground into the catacombs that lie beneath the arena We follow instructions to my destination a chamber for my preparation In the Capitol they call it the Launch Room In the districts its referred to as the Stockyard The place animals go before slaughter Everything is brandnew I will be the first and only tribute to use this Launch Room The arenas are historic sites preserved after the Games Popular destinations for Capitol residents to visit to vacation Go for a month rewatch the Games tour the catacombs visit the sites where the deaths took place You can even take part in reenactments They say the food is excellent I struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and clean my teeth Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid down my back Then the clothes arrive the same for every tribute Cinna has had no say in my outfit does not even know what will be in the package but he helps me dress in the undergarments simple tawny pants light green blouse sturdy brown belt and thin hooded black jacket that falls to my thighs The material in the jackets designed to reflect body heat Expect some cool nights he says The boots worn over skintight socks are better than I could have hoped for Soft leather not unlike my ones athome These have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though Good for running I think Im finished when Cinna pulls the gold mockingjay pin from his pocket I had completely forgotten about it Where did you get that I ask Off the green outfit you wore on the train he says I remember nowtaking it off my mothers dress pinning it to the shirt Its your district token right I nod and he fastens it on my shirt It barely cleared the review board Some thought the pin could be used as a weapon giving you an unfair advantage But eventually they let it through says Cinna They eliminated a ring from that District One girl though If you twisted the gemstone a spike popped out Poisoned one She claimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there was no way to prove she did But she lost her token There youre all set Move around Make sure everything feels comfortable I walk run in a circle swing my arms about Yes its fine Fits perfectly Then theres nothing to do but wait for the call says Cinna Unless you think you could eat any more I turn down food but accept a glass of water that I take tiny sips of as we wait on a couch I dont want to chew on my nails or lips so Ifind myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek It still hasnt fully healed from a few days ago Soon the taste of blood fills my mouth Nervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is to come I could be dead flatout dead in an hour Not even My fingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm where the woman injected the tracking device I press on it even though it hurts I press on it so hard a small bruise begins to form Do you want to talk Katniss Cinna asks I shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to him Cinna encloses it in both of his And this is how we sit until a pleasant female voice announces its time to prepare for launch Still clenching one of Cinnas hands I walk over and stand on the circular metal plate Remember what Haymitch said Run find water The rest will follow he says I nod And remember this Im not allowed to bet but if I could my money would be on you Truly I whisper Truly says Cinna He leans down and kisses me on the forehead Good luck girl on fire And then a glass cylinder is lowering around me breaking our handhold cutting him off from me He taps his fingers under his chin Head high I lift my chin and stand as straight as I can The cylinder begins to rise For maybe fifteen seconds Im in darkness and then I can feel the metal plate pushingme out of the cylinder into the open air For a moment my eyes are dazzled by the bright sunlight and Im conscious only of a strong wind with the hopeful smell of pine trees Then I hear the legendary announcer Claudius Templesmith as his voice booms all around me Ladies and gentlemen let the Seventyfourth Hunger Games beginSixty seconds Thats how long were required to stand on our metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us Step off before the minute is up and land mines blow your legs off Sixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant from the Cornucopia a giant golden horn shaped like a cone with a curved tail the mouth of which is at least twenty feet high spilling over withthe things that will give us life here in the arena Food containers of water weapons medicine garments fire starters Strewn around the Cornucopia are other supplies their value decreasing the farther they are from the horn For instance only a few steps from my feet lays a threefoot square of plastic Certainly it could be of some use in a downpour But there in the mouth I can see a tent pack that would protect from almost any sort of weather If I had the guts to go in and fight for it against the other twentythree tributes Which I have been instructed not to do Were on a flat open stretch of ground A plain of hardpacked dirt Behind the tributes across from me I can see nothing indicating either a steep downward slope or even cliff To my right lies a lake To my left and back spars piney woods This is where Haymitch would want me to go Immediately I hear his instructions in my head Just clear out put as much distance as you can between yourselves and the others and find a source of water But its tempting so tempting when I see the bounty waiting there before me And I know that if I dont get it someone else will That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath will divide up most of these lifesustaining spoils Something catches my eye There resting on a mound of blanket rolls is a silver sheath of arrows and a bow already strung just waiting to be engaged Thats mine I think Its meant for me Im fast I can sprint faster than any ofthe girls in our school although a couple can beat me in distance races But this fortyyard length this is what I am built for I know I can get it I know I can reach it first but then the question is how quickly can I get out of there By the time Ive scrambled up the packs and grabbed the weapons others will have reached the horn and one or two I might be able to pick off but say theres a dozen at that close range they could take me down with the spears and the clubs Or their own powerful fists Still I wont be the only target Im betting many of the other tributes would pass up a smaller girl even one who scored an eleven in training to take out their more fierce adversaries Haymitch has never seen me run Maybe if he had hed tell me to go for it Get the weapon Since thats the very weapon that might be my salvation And I only see one bow in that whole pile I know the minute must be almost up and will have to decide what my strategy will be and I find myself positioning my feet to run not away into the stir rounding forests but toward the pile toward the bow When suddenly I notice Peeta hes about five tributes to my right quite a fair distance still I can tell hes looking at me and I think he might be shaking his head But the suns in my eyes and while Im puzzling over it the gong rings out And Ive missed it Ive missed my chance Because those extra couple of seconds Ive lost by not being ready are enough to change my mind about going in Myfeet shuffle for a moment confused at the direction my brain wants to take and then I lunge forward scoop up the sheet of plastic and a loaf of bread The pickings are so small and Im so angry with Peeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to retrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything because I cant stand leaving with virtually nothing A boy I think from District  reaches the pack at the same time I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he coughs splattering my face with blood I stagger back repulsed by the warm sticky spray Then the boy slips to the ground Thats when I see the knife in his back Already other tributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out to attack Yes the girl from District  ten yards away running toward me one hand clutching a halfdozen knives Ive seen her throw in training She never misses And Im her next target All the general fear Ive been feeling condenses into at immediate fear of this girl this predator who might kill me in seconds Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling thepack over one shoulder and run fullspeed for the woods I can hear the blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack up to protect my head The blade lodges in the pack Both straps on my shoulders now I make for the trees Somehow I know the girl will not pursue me That shell be drawn back into the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone A grin crosses my face Thanks for the knife I think At the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the field About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one another at the horn Several lie dead already on the ground Those who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or into the void opposite me I continue running until the woods have hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a steady jog that I think I can maintain for a while For the next few hours I alternate between jogging and walking putting as much distance as I can between myself and my competitors I lost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District  but managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold it neatly and tuck it into a pocket I also free the knife its a fine one with a long sharp blade serrated near the handle which will make it handy for sawing through things and slide it into my belt I dont dare stop to examine the contents of the pack yet I just keep moving pausing only to check for pursuers I can go a long time I know that from my days in the woods But I will need water That was Haymitchs second instruction and since I sort of botched the first I keep a sharp eye out for any sign of it No luck The woods begin to evolve and the pines are intermixed with a variety of trees some I recognize some completely foreign to me At one point I hear a noise and pull my knife thinking I may have to defend myself but Ive only startled a rabbit Good to see you I whisper Iftheres one rabbit there could be hundreds just waiting to be snared The ground slopes down I dont particularly like this Valleys make me feel trapped I want to be high like in the hills around District  where I can see my enemies approaching But I have no choice but to keep going Funny though I dont feel too bad The days of gorging myself have paid off Ive got staying power even though Im short on sleep Being in the woods is rejuvenating Im glad for the solitude even though its an illusion because Im probably onscreen right now Not consistently but off and on There are so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekkingthrough the woods isnt much to look at But theyll show me enough to let people know Im alive uninjured and on the move One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening when the initial casualties come in But that cant compare to what happens as the field shrinks to a handful of players Its late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons Each shot represents a dead tribute The fighting must have finally stopped at the Cornucopia They never collect the bloodbath bodies until the killers have dispersed On the opening day they dont even fire the cannons until the initial fightings over because its too hard to keep track of the fatalities I allow myself to pause panting as I count the shots One    Two    Three    On and on until they reach eleven Eleven dead in all Thirteen left to play My fingernails scrape at the dried blood the boy from District  coughed into my face Hes gone certainly I wonder about Peeta Has he lasted through the day Ill know in a few hours When they project the deads images into the sky for the rest of us to see All of a sudden Im overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta may be already lost bled white collected and in the process of being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up redressed and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District  No longer hereHeading home I try hard to remember if I saw him once the action started But the last image I can conjure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out Maybe its better if hes gone already He had no confidence he could win And I will not end up with the unpleasant task of killing him Maybe its better if hes out of this for good I slump down next to my pack exhausted I need to go through it anyway before night falls See what I have to work with As I unhook the straps I can feel its sturdily made although a rather unfortunate color This orange will practically glow in the dark I make a mental note to camouflage it first thing tomorrow I flip open the flap What I want most right at this moment is water Haymitchs directive to immediately find water was not arbitrary I wont last long without it For a few days Ill be able to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration but after that Ill deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in a week tops Icarefully lay out the provisions One thin black sleeping bag that reflects body heal A pack of crackers A pack of dried beef strips A bottle of iodine A box of wooden matches A small coil of wire A pair of sunglasses And a halfgallon plasticbottle with a cap for carrying water thats bone dry No water How hard would it have been for them to fill up the bottle I become aware of the dryness in my throat and mouth the cracks in my lips Ive been moving all day long Its been hot and Ive sweat a lot I do this at home but there are always streams to drink from or snow to melt if it should come to it As I refill my pack I have an awful thought The lake The one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound What if thats the only water source in the arena That way theyll guarantee drawing us in to fight The lake is a full days journey from where I sit now a much harder journey with nothing to drink And then even if I reach it its sure to be heavily guarded by some of the Career Tributes Im about to panic when I remember the rabbit I startled earlier today It has to drink too I just have to find out where Twilight is closing in and I am ill at ease The trees are too thin to offer much concealment The layer of pine needles that muffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder when I need their trails to find water And Im still heading downhill deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless Im hungry too but I dont dare break into my precious store of crackers and beef yet Instead I take my knife and go to work on a pine tree cutting away the outer bark and scraping off a large handful of the softer inner bark I slowly chew the stuff as I walk along After a week of the finest food in the world its a little hard to choke down But Ive eaten plenty of pine in my life Ill adjust quickly In another hour its clear Ive got to find a place to camp Night creatures are coming out I can hear the occasional hoot or howl my first clue that Ill be competing with natural predators for the rabbits As to whether Ill be viewed as a source of food its too soon to tell There could be any number of animals stalking me at this moment But right now I decide to make my fellow tributes a priority Im sure many will continue hunting through the night Those who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food an abundance of water from the lake torches or flashlights and weapons theyre itching to use I can only hope Ive traveled far and fast enough to be out of range Before settling down I take my wire and set two twitchup snares in the brush I know its risky to be setting traps but food will go so fast out here And I cant set snares on the run Still I walk another five minutes before making camp I pick my tree carefully A willow not terribly tall but set in a clump of other willows offering concealment in those long flowing tresses I climb up sticking to the strongerbranches close tothe trunk and find a sturdy fork for my bed It takes some doing but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively comfortable manner I place my backpack in the foot of the bag then slide in after it As a precaution I remove my belt loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag and refasten it at my waist Now if I roll over in my sleep I wont go crashing to the ground Im small enough to tuck the top of the bag over my head but I put on my hood as well As night falls the air is cooling quickly Despite the risk I took in getting the backpack I know now it was the right choice This sleeping bag radiating back and preserving my body heat will be invaluable Im sure there are several other tributes whose biggest concern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actually be able to get a few hours of sleep If only I wasnt so thirsty    Night has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds the death recap Through the branches I can see the seal of the Capitol which appears to be floating in the sky Im actually viewing another screen an enormous one thats transported by of one of their disappearing hovercraft The anthem fades out and the sky goes dark for a moment At home we would be watching full coverage of each and every killing but thats thought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes For instance if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone my secret would be revealed to all No here in the arena all we see are the same photographs they showed when they televised our training scores Simple head shots But now instead of scores they post only district numbers I take a deep breath as the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off one by one on my fingers The first to appear is the girl from District  That means that the Career Tributes from  and  have all survived No surprise there Then the boy from  I didnt expect that one usually all the Careers make it through the first day The boy from District     I guess the foxfaced girl made it Both tributes from  and  The boy from  Both from  Yes theres the boy who I fought for the backpack Ive run through my fingers only one more dead tribute to go Is it Peeta No theres the girl from District  Thats it The Capitol seal is back with a final musical flourish Then darkness and the sounds of the forest resume Im relieved Peetas alive I tell myself again that if I get killed his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most This is what I tellmyself to explain the conflicting emotions that arise when I think of Peeta The gratitude that he gave me an edge by professing his love for me in the interview The anger at his superiority on the roof The dread that we may come facetoface at any moment in this arena Eleven dead but none from District  I try to work out who is left Five Career Tributes Foxface Thresh and Rue Rue    So she made it through the first day after all I canthelp feeling glad That makes ten of us The other three Ill figure out tomorrow Now when it is dark and I have traveled far and I am nestled high in this tree now I must try and rest I havent really slept in two days and then theres been the long days journey into the arena Slowly I allow my muscles to relax My eyes to close The last thing I think is its lucky I dont snore    Snap The sound of a breaking branch wakes me How long have I been asleep Four hours Five The tip of my nose is icy cold Snap Snap Whats going on This is not the sound of a branch under someones foot but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree Snap Snap I judge it to be several hundred yards to my right Slowly noiselessly I turn myself in that direction For a few minutes theres nothing but blackness and some scuffling Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to bloom A pair of hands warms over flames but I cant make out more than that I have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know at the fire starter What are they thinking A fire Ill just at nightfall would have been one thing Those who battled at the Cornucopia with their superior strength and surplus of supplies they couldnt possibly have been near enough to spot the flames then But now when theyve probably been combing the woods for hours looking for victims You might as well be waving a flag and shouting Come and get me And here I am a stones throw from the biggest idiot in the Games Strapped in a tree Not daring to flee since my general location has just been broadcast to any killer who cares I mean I know its cold out here and not everybody has a sleeping bag But then you grit your teeth and stick it out until dawn I lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours really thinking that if I can get out of this tree I wont have the least problem taking out my new neighbor My instinct has been to flee not fight But obviously this persons a hazard Stupid people are dangerous And this one probably doesnt have much in the way of weapons while Ive got this excellent knifeThe sky is still dark but I can feel the first signs of dawn approaching Im beginning to think we meaning the person whose death Im now devising and me we might actually have gone unnoticed Then I hear it Several pairs of feet breaking into a run The fire starter must have dozed off Theyre on her before she can escape I know its a girl now I can tell by the pleading the agonized scream that follows Then theres laughter and congratulations from several voices Someone cries out Twelve down and eleven to go which gets a round of appreciative hoots So theyre fighting in a pack Im not really surprised Often alliances are formed in the early stages of the Games The strong band together to hunt down the weak then when the tension becomes too great begin to turn on one another I dont have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance Itll be the remaining CareerTributes from Districts   and  Two boys and three girls The ones who lunched together For a moment I hear them checking the girl for supplies I can tell by their comments theyve found nothing good I wonder if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought Shes much too bright to be building a fire like that Better clear out so they can get the body before it starts stinking Im almost certain thats the brutish boy from District  There are murmurs of assent and then to my horror I hear the pack heading toward me They do not know Im here How could they And Im well concealed in the clump of trees At least while the sun stays down Then my black sleeping bag will turn from camouflage to trouble If they just keep moving they will pass me and be gone in a minute But the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from my tree They have flashlights torches I can see an arm here a boot there through the breaks in the branches I turn to stone not even daring to breathe Have they spotted me No not yet I can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere Shouldnt we have heard a cannon by now Id say yes Nothing to prevent them from going in immediately Unless she isnt dead Shes dead I stuck her myself Then wheres the cannon Someone should go back Make sure the jobs done Yeah we dont want to have to track her down twice I said shes dead An argument breaks out until one tribute silences the others Were wasting time Ill go finish her and lets move on I almost fall out of the tree The voice belongs to PeetaThank goodness I had the foresight to belt myself in Ive rolled sideways off the fork and Im facing the ground held in place by the belt one hand and my feet straddling the pack inside my sleeping bag braced against the trunk There must have been some rustling when I tipped sideways but the Careers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch it Go on then Lover Boy says the boy from District  See for yourself I just get a glimpse of Peeta lit by a torch heading back to the girl by the fire His face is swollen with bruises theres a bloody bandage on one arm and from the sound of his gait hes limping somewhat I remember him shaking him his head telling me not to go into the fight for the supplies when all along all along hed planned to throw himself into the thick of things Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid him to do Okay I can stomach that Seeing all those supplies was tempting But this    This other thing This teaming up with the Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us No one from District  would think of doing such a thing Career tributes are overly vicious arrogant better fed but only because theyre the Capitols lapdogs Universally solidly hated by all but those from their own districts I can imagine the things theyre saying about him back home now And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about disgrace Obviously the noble boy on the rooftopwas playing just one more game with me But this will be his last I will eagerly watch the night skies for signs of his death if I dont kill him first myself The Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot then use hushed voices Why dont we just kill him now and get it over with Let him tag along Whats the harm And hes handy with that knife Is he Thats news What a lot of interesting things Im learning about my friend Peeta today Besides hes our best chance of finding her It takes me a moment to register that the her theyre referring to is me Why You think she bought into that sappy romance stuff She might have Seemed pretty simpleminded to me Every time I think about her spinning around in that dress I want to puke Wish we knew how she got that eleven Bet you Lover Boy knows The sound of Peeta returning silences them Was she dead asks the boy from District  No But she isnow says Peeta Just then the cannon fires Ready to move on The Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to break and birdsong fills the air I remain in my awkward position muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer then hoist myself back onto my branch I need to get down to get going but for a moment I lie there digesting what Ive heard Not only is Peeta with the Careers hes helping them find me The simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because of her eleven Because she can use a bow and arrow Which Peeta knows better than anyone But he hasnt told them yet Is he saving that information because he knows its all that keeps him alive Is he still pretending to love me for the audience What is going on in his head Suddenly the birds fall silent Then one gives a highpitched warning call A single note Just like the one Gale and I heard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught High above the dying campfire a hovercraft materializes A set of huge metal teeth drops down Slowly gently the dead tribute girl is lifted into the hovercraft Then it vanishes The birds resume their song Move I whisper to myself I wriggle out of my sleeping bag roll it up and place it in the pack I take a deep breath While Ive been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willowbranches it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me I know they must be tracking me now though The minute I hit the ground Im guaranteed a closeup The audience will have been beside themselves knowing I was in the tree that I overheard the Careers talking that I discovered Peeta was with them Until I work out exactly how I want to play that Id better at least act on top of things Not perplexed Certainly not confused or frightened No I need to look one step ahead of the game So as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light I pause a second giving the cameras time to lock on me Then I cock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile There Let them figure outwhat that means Im about to take off when I think of my snares Maybe its imprudent to check them with the others so close But have to Too many years of hunting I guess And the lure of possible meat Im rewarded with one fine rabbit In no time Ive cleaned and gutted the animal leaving the head feet tail skin and innards under a pile of leaves Im wishing for a fire eating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever a lesson I learned the hard way when I think of the dead tribute I hurryback to her camp Sure enough the coals of her dying fire are still hot I cut up the rabbit fashion a spit out of branches and set it over the coals Im glad for the cameras now I want sponsors to see I can hunt that Im a good bet because I wont be lured into traps as easily as the others will by hunger While the rabbit cooks I grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack The black tones it down but I feel a layer of mud would definitely help Of course to have mud Id need water    I pull on my gear grab my spit kick some dirt over the coals and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went I eat half the rabbit as I go then wrap up the leftovers in my plastic for later The meat stops the grumbling in my stomach but does little to quench my thirst Water is my top priority now As I hike along I feel certain Im still holding the screen in the Capitol so Im careful to continue to hide my emotions But what a good time Claudius Templesmith must be having with his guest commentators dissecting Peetas behavior my reaction What to make of it all Has Peeta revealed his true colors How does this affect the betting odds Will we lose sponsors Do we even have sponsors Yes I feel certain we do or at least did Certainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our starcrossed loverdynamic Or has he Maybe since he hasnt spoken much about me we can still get some mileage out of it Maybe people will think its something we plotted together if I seem like it amuses me now The sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy it seems overly bright I coat my lips in some grease from the rabbit and try to keep from panting but its no use Its only been a day and Im dehydrating fast I try and think of everything I know about finding water It runs downhill so in fact continuing down into this valley isnt a bad thing If I could just locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of vegetation these might help me along but nothing seems to change Theres just the slight gradual slope the birds the sameness to the trees As the day wears on I know Im headed for trouble What little urine Ive been able to pass is a dark brown my head is aching and theres a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to moisten The sun hurts my eyes so I dig out my sunglasses but when I put them on they do something funny to my vision so I just stuff them back in my pack Its late afternoon when I think Ive foundhelp I spot a cluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit to suck thesweet juices from the skins But just as Im holding them to my lips I get a hard look at them What I thought were blueberries have a slightly different shape and when I break one open the insides are bloodred I dont recognize these berries perhaps they are edible but Im guessing this is some evil trick on the part of the Gamemakers Even the plant instructor in the Training Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries unless you were  percent sure they werent toxic Something I already knew but Im so thirsty it takes her reminder to give me the strength to fling them away Fatigue is beginning to settle on me but its not the usual tiredness that follows a long hike I have to stop and rest frequently although I know the only cure for what ails me requires continued searching I try a new tactic climbing a tree as high as I dare in my shaky state to look for any signs of water But as far as I can see in any direction theres the same unrelenting stretch of forest Determined to go on until nightfall I walk until Im stumbling over my own feet Exhausted I haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in Ive no appetite but I suck on a rabbit bone just to give my mouth something to do Night falls the anthem plays and high in the sky I see the picture of the girl who was apparently from District  The one Peeta wentback to finish off My fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my burning thirst Besides they were heading away from me and by now they too will have to rest With the scarcity of water they may even have had to return to the lake for refills Maybe that is the only course for me as well Morning brings distress My heads throbs with every beat of my heart Simple movements send stabs of pain through my joints I fall rather than jump from the tree It takes several minutes for me to assemble my gear Somewhere inside me I know this is wrong I should be acting with more caution moving with more urgency But my mind seems foggy and forming a plan is hard I lean back against the trunk of my tree one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my tongue as I assess my options How can I get water Return to the lake No good Id never make it Hope for rain Theres not a cloud in the sky Keep looking Yes this is my only chance But then another thought hits me and the surge of anger that follows brings me to me senses Haymitch He could send me water Press a button and have it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes I know I must have sponsors at least one or two who could afford a pint of liquid for me Yes its pricey but these people theyre made of money And theyllbe betting on me as well Perhaps Haymitch doesnt realize how deep my need is I say in a voice as loud as I dare Water I wait hopefully for a parachute to descend from the sky But nothing is forthcoming Something is wrongAm I deluded about having sponsors Or has Peetas behavior made them all hang back No I dont believe it Theres someone out there who wants to buy me water only Haymitch is refusing to let it go through As my mentor he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors I know he hates me Hes made that clear enough But enough to let me die From this He cant do that can he If a mentor mistreats his tributes hell be held accountable by the viewers by the people back in District  Even Haymitch wouldnt risk that would he Say what you will about my fellow traders in the Hob but I dont think theyd welcome him back there if he let me die this way And then where would he get his liquor So    What Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him Is he directing all the sponsors toward Peeta Is he just too drunk to even notice whats going on at the moment Somehow I dont believe that and I dont believe hes trying to kill me off by neglect either He has in fact in his own unpleasant way genuinely been trying to prepare me for this Then what is going on I bury my face in my hands Theres no danger of tears now I couldnt produce one to save my life What is Haymitch doing Despite my anger hatred and suspicions a small voice in the back of my head whispers an answer Maybe hes sending you a message it says A message Saying what Then I know Theres only one good reason Haymitch could be withholding water from me Because he knows Ive almost found it I grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet My backpack seems to have tripled in weight I find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and I start off The suns beating down even more searing than the first two days I feel like an old piece of leather drying and cracking in the heat Every step is an effort but I refuse to stop I refuse to sit down If I sit theres a good chance I wont be able to get up again that I wont even remember my task What easy prey I am Any tribute even tiny Rue could take me right now merely shove me over and kill me with my own knife and Id have little strength to resist But if anyone is in my part of the woods they ignore me The truth is I feel a million miles from another living soul Not alone though No theyve surely got a camera tracking me now I think back tothe years of watching tributes starve freeze bleed and dehydrate to death Unless theres a really good fight going on somewhere Im being featured My thoughts turn to Prim Its likely she wont be watching me live but theyll show updates at the school during lunch For her sake I try to look as least desperate as I can But by afternoon I know the end is coming My legs are shaking and my heart too quick I keep forgetting exactly what Im doing Ive stumbled repeatedly and managed to regain my feet but when the stick slides out from under me I finally tumble to the ground unable to get up I let my eyes close I have misjudged Haymitch He has nointention of helping me at all This is all right I think This is not so bad here The air is less hot signifying evenings approach Theres a slight sweet scent that reminds me of lilies My fingers stroke the smooth ground sliding easily across the top This is an okay place to die I think My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool slippery earth I love mud I think How many times Ive tracked game with the help of its soft readable surface Good for bee stings too Mud Mud Mud My eyes fly open and I dig my fingers into the earth It is mud My nose lifts in the air And those are lilies Pond lilies I crawl now through the mud dragging myself toward the scent Five yards from where I fell I crawl through a tangle of plants into a pond Floating on the top yellow flowers in bloom are my beautiful lilies Its all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and gulp down as much as I can hold But I have just enough sense left to abstain With trembling hands I get out my flask and fill it with water I add what I remember to be the right number of drops of iodine for purifying it The half an hour of waiting is agony but I do it At least I think its a half an hour but its certainly as long as I can stand Slowly easy now I tell myself I take one swallow and make myself wait Then another Over the next couple of hours I drink the entire half gallon Then a second I prepare another before I retire to a tree where I continue sipping eating rabbit and even indulge in one of my precious crackers By the time the anthem plays I feel remarkably better There are no faces tonight no tributes died today Tomorrow Ill stay here resting camouflaging my backpack with mud catching some of those little fish I saw as I sipped digging up the roots of the pond lilies to make a nice meal I snuggle down in my sleeping bag hanging on to my water bottle for dear life which of course it is A few hours laterthe stampede of feet shakes me from slumber I look around in bewilderment Its not yet dawn but my stinging eyes can see it It would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on meMy first impulse is to scramble from the tree but Im belted in Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall to the ground in a heap still snarled in my sleeping bag Theres no time for any kind of packing Fortunately my backpack and water bottle are already in the bag I shove in the belt hoist the bag over my shoulder and flee The world has transformed to flame and smoke Burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet All I can do is follow the others the rabbits and deer and I even spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods I trust their sense of direction because their instincts are sharper than mine But they are much faster flying through the underbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen tree limbs that theres no way I can keep apace with them The heat is horrible but worse than the heat is the smoke which threatens to suffocate me at any moment I pull the top of my shirt up over my nose grateful to find it soaked in sweat and it offers a thin veil of protection And I run choking my bag banging against my back my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning because I know I am supposed to run This was no tributes campfire gone out of control no accidental occurrence The flames that bear down on me have an unnatural height a uniformity that marks them as humanmade machinemade Gamemakermade Things have been too quiet today No deaths perhaps no fights at all The audience in the Capitol will be getting bored claiming that these Games are verging on dullness This is the one thing the Games must not do Its not hard to follow the Gamemakers motivation There is the Career pack and then there are the rest of us probably spread far and thin across the arena This fire is designed to flush us out to drive us together It may not be the most original device Ive seen but its very very effective I hurdle over a burning log Not high enough The tail end of my jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to rip it from my body and stamp out the flames But I dont dare leave the jacket scorched andsmoldering as it is I take the risk of shoving it in my sleeping bag hoping the lack of air will quell what I havent extinguished This is all I have what I carry on my back and its little enough to survive with In a matter of minutes my throat and nose are burning The coughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if they are actually being cooked Discomfort turns to distress until each breath sends a searing pain through my chest I manage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the vomiting begins and I lose my meager supper and whatever water has remained in my stomach Crouching on my hands and knees I retch until theres nothing left to come up I know I need to keep moving but Im trembling and lightheaded now gasping for air I allow myself about a spoonful of water to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows from my bottle You get one minute I tell myself One minute to rest I take the time to reorder my supplies wad up the sleeping bag and messily stuff everything into the backpack My minutes up I know its time to move on but the smoke has clouded my thoughts The swiftfooted animals that were my compass have left me behind I know I havent been in this part of the woods before there were no sizable rocks like the one Im sheltering against on my earlier travelsWhere are the Gamemakers driving me Back to the lake To a whole new terrain filled with new dangers I had just found a few hours of peace at the pond when this attack began Would there be any way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way back there to a source of water at least The wall of fire must have anend and it wont burn indefinitely Not because the Gamemakers couldnt keep it fueled but because again that would invite accusations of boredom from the audience If I could get back behind the fire line I could avoid meeting up with the Careers Ive just decided to try and loop back around although it will require miles of travel away from the inferno and then a very circuitous route back when the first fireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head I spring out from under my ledge energized by renewed fear The game has taken a twist The fire was just to get us moving now the audience will get to see some real fun When I hear the next hiss I flatten on the ground not taking time to look The fireball hits a tree off to my left engulfing it in flames To remain still is death Im barely on my feet before the third ball hits the ground where I was lying sending a pillar of fire up behind me Timeloses meaning now as I frantically try to dodge the attacks I cant see where theyre being launched from but its not a hovercraft The angles are not extreme enough Probably this whole segment of the woods has been armed with precision launchers that are concealed in trees or rocks Somewhere in a cool and spotless room a Gamemaker sits at a set of controls fingers on the triggers that could end my life in a second All that is needed is a direct hit Whatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning to my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and leap to avoid the fireballs Each one is only the size of an apple but packs tremendous power on contact Every sense I have goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over Theres no time to judge if a move is the correct one When theres a hiss I act or die Something keeps me moving forward though A lifetime of watching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas of the arena are rigged for certain attacks And that if I can just get away from this section I might be able to move out of reach of the launchers I might also then fall straight into a pit of vipers but I cant worry about that now How long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I cant say but the attacks finally begin to abate Which is good because Im retchingagain This time its an acidic substance that scalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well Im forced to stop as my body convulses trying desperately to rid itself of the poisons Ive been sucking in during the attack I wait for the next hiss the next signal to bolt It doesnt come The force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my stinging eyes My clothes are drenched in sweat Somehow through the smoke and vomit I pick up the scent of singed hair My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has seared off at least six inches of it Strands of blackened hair crumble in my fingers I stare at them fascinated by the transformation when the hissing registers My muscles react only not fast enoughthis time The fireball crashes into the ground at my side but not before it skids across my right calf Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over the edge I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet shrieking trying to remove myself from the horror When I finally regain enough sense I roll the leg back and forth on the ground which stifles the worst of it But then without thinking I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands I sit on the ground a few yards from the blazeset off by the fireball My calf is screaming my hands covered in red welts Im shaking too hard to move If the Gamemakers want to finish me off now is the time I hear Cinnas voice carrying images of rich fabric and sparkling gems Katniss the girl who was on fire What a good laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one Perhaps Cinnas beautiful costumes have even brought on this particular torture for me I know he couldnt have foreseen this must be hurting for me because in fact I believe he cares about me But all in all maybe showing up stark naked in that chariot would have been safer for me The attack is now over The Gamemakers dont want me dead Not yet anyway Everyone knows they could destroy us all within seconds of the opening gong The real sport of the Hunger Games is watching the tributes kill one another Every so often they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they can But mostly they manipulate us into confronting one another facetoface Which means if I am no longer being fired at there is at least one other tribute close at hand I would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I could but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me I make myself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames that lights up the sky It does not seem to be pursuing me any longer exceptwith its stinking black clouds Another light daylight begins to softly emerge Swirls of smoke catch the sunbeams My visibility is poor I can see maybe fifteen yards in any direction A tribute could easily be concealed from me here I should draw my knife as a precaution but I doubt my ability to hold it for long The pain in my hands can in no way compete with that in my calf I hate burns have always hated them even a small one gotten from pulling a pan of bread from the oven It is the worst kind of pain to me but I have never experienced anything like this Im so weary I dont even notice Im in the pool until Im ankledeep Its springfed bubbling up out of a crevice in some rocks and blissfully cool I plunge my hands into the shallow water and feel instant relief Isnt that what my mother always says The first treatment for a burn is cold water That it draws out the heat But she means minor burns Probably shed recommend it for my hands But what of my calf Although I have not yet had the courage to examine it Im guessing that its an injury in a whole different class I lie on my stomach at edge of thepool for a while dangling my hands in the water examining the little flames onmy fingernails that are beginning to chip off Good Ive had enough fire for a lifetime I bathe the blood and ash from my face I try to recall all I know about burns They are common injuries in the Seam where we cook and heat our homes with coal Then there are the mine accidents    A family once brought in an unconscious young man pleading with my mother to help him The district doctor whos responsible for treating the miners had written him off told the family to take him home to die But they wouldnt accept this He lay on our kitchen table senseless to the world I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh gaping charred flesh burned clear down to the bone before I ran from the house I went to the woods and hunted the entire day haunted by the gruesome leg memories of my fathers death Whats funny was Prim whos scared of her own shadow stayed and helped My mother says healers are born not made They did their best but the man died just like the doctor said he would My leg is in need of attention but I still cant look at it What if its as bad as the mans and I can see my bone Then I remember my mother saying that if a burns severe the victim might not even feel pain because the nerves would be destroyed Encouraged by this I sit up and swing my leg in front of me I almost faintat the sight of my calf The flesh is a brilliant red covered with blisters I force myself to take deep slow breaths feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face I cant show weakness at this injury Not if I want help Pity does not get you aid Admiration at your refusal to give in does I cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and examine the injury more closely The burned area is about the size of my hand None of the skin is blackened I think its not too bad to soak Gingerly I stretch out my leg into the pool propping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesnt get too sodden and sigh because this does offer some relief I know there are herbs if I could find them that would speed the healing but I cant quite call them to mind Water and time will probably be all I have to work with Should I be moving on The smoke is slowly clearing but still too heavy to be healthy If I do continue away from the fire wont I be walking straight into the weapons of the Careers Besides every time I lift my leg from the water the pain rebounds so intensely I have to slide it back in My hands are slightly less demanding They can handle small breaks from the pool So I slowly put my gear back in order First I fill my bottle with the pool water treat it and when enough time has passed begin to rehydrate my body After a timeI force myself to nibble on a cracker which helps settle my stomach I roll up my sleeping bag Except for a few black marks its relatively unscathed My jackets another matter Stinking and scorched at leasta foot of the back beyond repair I cut off the damaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to the bottom of my ribs But the hoods intact and its far better than nothing Despite the pain drowsiness begins to take over Id take to a tree and try to rest except Id be too easy to spot Besides abandoning my pool seems impossible I neatly arrange my supplies even settle my pack on my shoulders but I cant seem to leave I spot some water plants with edible roots and make a small meal with my last piece of rabbit Sip water Watch the sun make its slow arc across the sky Where would I go anyway that is any safer than here I lean back on my pack overcome by drowsiness If the Careers want me let them find me I think before drifting into a stupor Let them find me And find me they do Its lucky Im ready to move on because when I hear the feet I have less than a minute head start Evening has begun to fall The moment I awake Im up and running splashing across the poolflying into the underbrush My leg slows me down but I sense my pursuers are not as speedy as they were before the fire either I hear their coughs their raspy voices calling to one another Still they are closing in just like a pack of wild dogs and so I do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances I pick a high tree and begin to climb If running hurt climbing is agonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct contact of my hands on the tree bark Im fast though and by the time theyve reached the base of my trunk Im twenty feet up For a moment we stop and survey one another I hope they cant hear the pounding of my heart This could be it I think What chance do I have against them All six are there the five Careers and Peeta and my only consolation is theyre pretty beatup too Even so look at their weapons Look at their faces grinning and snarling at me a sure kill above them It seems pretty hopeless But then something else registers Theyre bigger and stronger than I am no doubt but theyre also heavier Theres a reason its me and not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit or rob the most remote bird nests I must weigh at least fifty or sixty pounds less than the smallest Career Now I smile Hows everything with you I call down cheerfully This takes them aback but I knowthe crowd will love it Well enough says the boy from District  Yourself Its been a bit warm for my taste I say I can almost hear the laughter from the Capitol The airs better up here Why dont you come on up Think I will says the same boy Here take this Cato says the girl from District  and she offers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows My bow My arrows Just the sight of them makes me so angry I want to scream at myself at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from having them I try to make eye contact with him now but he seems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his knife with the edgeof his shirt No says Cato pushing away the bow Ill do better with my sword I can see the weapon a short heavy blade at his belt I give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin to climb again Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the way I can scurry up even the slenderest limb Part of its my weight but part of its practice You have to know where to place your hands and feet Im another thirty feet in the air when I hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he and a branch go down He hits the ground hard and Im hoping he possibly broke his neckwhen he gets back to his feet swearing like a fiend The girl with the arrows Glimmer I hear someone call her ugh the names the people in District  give their children are so ridiculous anyway Glimmer scales the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop Im at least eighty feet high now She tries to shoot me and its immediately evident that shes incompetent with a bow One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me though and Im able to seize it I wave it teasingly above her head as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it when actually I mean to use it if I ever get the chance I could kill them everyone of them if those silver weapons were in my hands The Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them growling conspiratorially among themselves furious I have made them look foolish But twilight has arrived and their window of attack on me is closing Finally I hear Peeta say harshly Oh let her stay up there Its not like shes going anywhere Well deal with her in the morning Well hes right about one thing Im going nowhere All the relief from the pool water has gone leaving me to feel the full potency of my burns I scoot down to a fork in the tree and clumsily prepare for bed Put on my jacket Lay out my sleeping bed Belt myself in and try to keep frommoaning The heat of the bags too much for my leg I cut a slash in the fabric and hang my calf out in the open air I drizzle water on the wound my hands All my bravado is gone Im weak from pain and hunger but cant bring myself to eat Even if I can last the night what will the morning bring I stare into the foliage trying to will myself to rest but the burns forbid it Birds are settling down for the night singing lullabies to their young Night creatures emerge An owl hoots The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the smoke The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neighboring tree a possum maybe catching the firelight from the Careers torches Suddenly Im up on one elbow Those are no possums eyes I know their glassy reflection too well In fact those are not animal eyes at all In the last dim rays of light I make her out watching me silently from between the branches Rue How long has she been here The whole time probably Still and unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her Perhaps she headed up her treeshortly before I did hearing the pack was so close For a while we hold each others gaze Then without even rustling a leaf her little hand slides into the open andpoints to something above my headMy eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage above me At first I have no idea what shes pointing to but then about fifteen feet up I make out the vague shape in the dimming light But of    Of what Some sort of animal It looks about the size of a raccoon but it hangs from the bottom of a branch swaying ever so slightly Theres something else Among the familiar evening sounds of the woods my ears register a low hum Then I know Its a wasp nest Fear shoots through me but I have enough sense to keep still After all I dont know what kind of wasp lives there It could be the ordinary leaveusaloneandwellleaveyoualone type But these are the Hunger Games and ordinary isnt the norm More likely they will be one of the Capitols muttations tracker jackers Like the jabberjays these killer wasps were spawned in a lab and strategically placed like land mines around the districts during the war Larger than regular wasps they have a distinctive solid gold body and asting that raises a lump the size of a plum on contact Most people cant tolerate more than a few stings Some die at once If you live the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually driven people to madness And theres another thing these wasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and attempt to kill them Thats where the tracker part of the name comes from After the war the Capitol destroyed all the nests surrounding their city but the ones near the districts were left untouched Another reminder of our weakness I suppose just like the Hunger Games Another reason to keep inside the fence of District  When Gale and I come across a tracker jacker nest we immediately head in the opposite direction So is that what hangs above me I look back to Rue for help but shes melted into her tree Given my circumstances I guess it doesnt matter what type of wasp nest it is Im wounded and trapped Darkness has given me a brief reprieve but by the time the sun rises the Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me Theres no way they could do otherwise after Ive made them look so stupid That nest may be the sole option I have left If I can drop it down on them I may be able to escape But Ill risk my life in the process Of course Ill never be able to get in close enough to the actual nest tocut it free Ill have to saw off the branch at the trunk and send the whole thing down The serrated portion of my knife should be able to manage that But can my hands And will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm And what if the Careers figure out what Im doing and move their camp That would defeat the whole purpose I realize that the best chance Ill have to do the sawing without drawing notice will be during theanthem That could begin any time I drag myself out of my bag make sure my knife is secured in my belt and begin to make my way up the tree This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me but I persevere When I reach the limb that supports the nest the humming becomes more distinctive But its still oddly subdued if these are tracker jackers Its the smoke I think Its sedated them This was the one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps The seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem blares out Its now or never I think and begin to saw Blisters burst on my right hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back and forth Once Ive got a groove the work requires less effort but is almostmore than I can handle I grit my teeth and saw away occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there were no deaths today Thats all right The audience will be sated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me But the anthems running out and Im only three quarters of the way through the wood when the music ends the sky goes dark and Im forced to stop Now what I could probably finish off the job by sense of feel but that may not be the smartest plan If the wasps are too groggy if the nest catches on its way down if I try to escape this could all be a deadly waste of time Better I think to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies In the faint light of the Careers torches I inch back down to my fork to find the best surprise Ive ever had Sitting on my sleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver parachute My first gift from a sponsor Haymitch must have had it sent in during the anthem The pot easily fits in the palm of my hand What can it be Not food surely I unscrew the lid and I know by the scent that its medicine Cautiously I probe the surface of the ointment The throbbing in my fingertip vanishes Oh Haymitch I whisper Thank you He has not abandoned me Not left me to fend entirely for myself The cost of this medicine must be astronomical Probablynot one but many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot To me it is priceless I dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over my calf The effect is almost magical erasing the pain on contact leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind This is no herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland plants its hightech medicine brewed up in the Capitols labs When my calf is treated I rub a thin layer into my hands After wrapping the pot in the parachute I nestle it safely away in my pack Now that the pain has eased its all I can do to reposition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep A bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new day is dawning In the gray morning light I examine my hands The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a soft babyskin pink My leg still feels inflamed but that burn was far deeperI apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear Whatever happens Im going to have to move and move fast I also make myself eat a cracker and a strip of beef and drink a few cups of water Almost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday and Im already starting to feel the effects of hunger Below me Ican see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on the ground By her position leaning up against the trunk of the tree Id guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard but fatigue overcame her My eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me but I cant make out Rue Since she tipped me off it only seems fair to warn her Besides if Im going to die today its Rue I want to win Even if it means a little extra food for my family the idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable I call Rues name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear wide and alert at once She points up to the nest again I hold up my knife and make a sawing motion She nods and disappears Theres a rustling in a nearby tree Then the same noise again a bit farther off I realize shes leaping from tree to tree Its all I can do not to laugh out loud Is this what she showed the Gamemakers I imagine her flying around the training equipment never touching the floor She should have gotten at least a ten Rosy streaks are breaking through in the east I cant afford to wait any longer Compared to the agony of last nights climb this one is a cinch At the tree limb that holds the nest I position the knife in the groove and Im about to draw the teeth across the wood when I see something moving There on the nest The bright goldgleam of a tracker jacker lazily making its way across the papery gray surface No question its acting a little subdued but the wasp is up and moving and that means the others will be out soon as well Sweat breaks out on the palms of my hands beading up through the ointment and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt If I dont get through this branch in a matter of seconds the entire swarm could emerge and attack me Theres no sense in putting it off I take a deep breath grip the knife handle and bear down as hard as I can Back forth back forth The tracker jackers begin to buzz and I hear them coming out Back forth back forth A stabbing pain shoots through my knee and I know one has found me and the others will be honing in Back forth back forth And just as the knife cuts through I shove the end of the branch as far away from me as I can It crashes down through the lower branches snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground The nest bursts open like an egg and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air I feel a second sting on the cheek a third on my neck and their venom almost immediately makes me woozy I cling to the tree with one arm while I rip the barbed stingers out of my flesh Fortunately only these three tracker jackers hadidentified me before the nest went down The rest of the insects have targeted their enemies on the ground Its mayhem The Careers have woken to a fullscale tracker jacker attack Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop everything and bolt I can hear cries of To the lake To the lake and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the water It must be close if they think they can outdistance the furious insects Glimmer and another girl the one from District  are not so lucky They receive multiple stings before theyre even out of my view Glimmer appears to go completely mad shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow which is pointless She calls to the others for help but of course no one returns The girl from District  staggers out of sight although I wouldnt bet on her making it to the lake I watch Glimmer fall twitch hysterically around on the ground for a few minutes and then go still The nest is nothing but an empty shell The wasps have vanished in pursuit of the others I dont think theyll return but I dont want to risk it I scamper down the tree and hit the ground running in the opposite direction of the lake The poison from the stingers makes me wobbly but I find my way back to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water just in case any wasps are still on my trailAfter about five minutes I drag myself onto the rocks People have not exaggerated the effects of the tracker jacker stings Actually the one on my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size A foulsmelling green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out the stingers The swelling The pain The ooze Watching Glimmer twitching to death on the ground Its a lot to handle before the sun has even cleared the horizon I dont want to think about what Glimmer must look like now Her body disfigured Her swollen fingers stiffening around the bow    The bow Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought connects to another and Im on my feet teetering through the trees back to Glimmer The bow The arrows I must get them I havent heard the cannons fire yet so perhaps Glimmer is in some sort of coma her heart still struggling against the wasp venom But once it stops and the cannon signals her death a hovercraft will move in and retrieve her body taking the only bow and sheath of arrows Ive seen out of the Games for good And I refuse to let them slip through my fingers again I reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires The tracker jackers have vanished This girl so breathtakingly beautiful in her golden dress the night of the interviews is unrecognizable Her features eradicated herlimbs three times their normal size The stinger lumps have begun to explode spewing putrid green liquid around her I have to break several of what used to be her fingers with a stone to free the bow The sheath of arrows is pinned under her back I try to roll over her body by pulling on one arm but the flesh disintegratesin my hands and I fall back on the ground Is this real Or have the hallucinations begun I squeeze my eyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth ordering myself not to become sick Breakfast must stay down it might be days before I can hunt again A second cannon fires and Im guessing the girl from District  has just died I hear the birds fall silent and then one give the warning call which means a hovercraft is about to appear Confused I think its for Glimmer although this doesnt quite make sense because Im still in the picture still fighting for the arrows I lurch back onto my knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles In the middle of the sky I spot the hovercraft I throw myself over Glimmers body as if to protect it but then I see the girl from District  being lifted into the air and vanishing Do this I command myself Clenching my jaw I dig my hands underGlimmers body get a hold on what must be her rib cage and force her onto her stomach I cant help it Im hyperventilating now the whole thing is so nightmarish and Im losing my grasp on whats real I tug on the silver sheath of arrows but its caught on something her shoulder blade something and finally yank it free Ive just encircled the sheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps several pairs coming through the underbrush and I realize the Careers have come back Theyve come back to kill me or get their weapons or both But its too late to run I pull a slimy arrow from the sheath and try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one string I see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive I cant do it I cant do it I cant do it Im helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees spear lifted poised to throw The shock on Peetas face makes no sense to me I wait for the blow Instead his arm drops to his side What are you still doing here he hisses at me I stare uncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under his ear His whole body starts sparkling as if hes been dipped in dew Are you mad Hes prodding me with the shaft of the spear now Get up Get up I rise but hes still pushing at me What What is going on He shoves me away from him hard Run he screams RunBehind him Cato slashes his way through the brush Hes sparkling wet too and badly stung under one eye I catch the gleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says Holding tightly to my bow and arrows banging into trees that appear out of nowhere tripping and falling as I try to keep my balance Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods The world begins to bend in alarming ways A butterfly balloons to the size of a house then shatters into a million stars Trees transform to blood and splash down over my boots Ants begin to crawl out of the blisters on my hands and I cant shake them free Theyre climbing up my arms my neck Someones screaming a long high pitched scream that never breaks for breath I have a vague ideait might be me I trip and fall into a small pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the tracker jacker nest Tucking my knees up to my chin I wait for death Sick and disoriented Im able to form only one thought Peeta Mellark just saved my life Then the ants bore into my eyes and I black out I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me All the things I dread most all the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I cant help but believe theyre real Each time I wake I think At last this is over but it isnt Its only the beginning of a new chapter of torture How many ways do I watch Prim die Relive my fathers last moments Feel my own body ripped apart This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom so carefully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain When I finally do come to my senses I lie still waiting for the next onslaught of imagery But eventually I accept that the poison must have finally worked its way out of my system leaving my body wracked and feeble Im still lying on my side locked in the fetal position I lift a hand to my eyes to find them sound untouched by ants that never existed Simply stretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort So many parts of me hurt it doesnt seem worthwhile taking inventory of them Very very slowly I manage to sit up Im in a shallow hole not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallucination but with old dead leaves My clothings damp but I dont know whether pond water dew rain or sweat is the cause For a long time all I can do is take tiny sips from my bottleand watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle bush How long have I been out It was morning when I lost reason Now its afternoon But the stiffness in my joints suggests more than a day has passed even two possibly If so Ill have no way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker attack Not Glimmer or the girl from District  But there was the boy from District  both tributes from District  and Peeta Did they die from the stings Certainly if they lived their last days must have been as horrid as my own And what about Rue Shes so small it wouldnt take much venom to do her in But then again    The tracker jackers wouldve had to catch her and she had a good head start A foul rotten taste pervades my mouth and the water has little effect on it I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush and pluck a flower I gently pull the stamen through the blossom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue The sweetness spreads through my mouth down my throat warming my veins with memories of summer and my home woods and Gales presence beside me For some reason our discussion from that last morning comes back to me We could do it you know What Leave the district Run off Live in the woods You and I we could make it And suddenly Im not thinking ofGale but of Peeta and   Peeta He saved my life I think Because by the time we met up I couldnt tell what was real and what the tracker jacker venom had caused me to imagine But if he did and my instincts tell me he did what for Is he simply working the Lover Boy angle he initiated at the interview Or was he actually trying to protect me And if he was what was he doing with those Careers in the first place None of it makes sense I wonder what Gale made of the incident for a moment and then I push the whole thing out of my mind because for some reason Gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my thoughts So I focus on the one really good thing thats happened since I landed in the arena I have a bow and arrows A full dozen arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree They bear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from Glimmers body which leads me to believe that might not have been wholly real but they have a fair amount of dried blood on them I can clean them later but I do take a minute to shoot a few into a nearby tree They are more like the weapons in the Training Center than my ones at home but who cares That I can work with Theweapons give me an entirely new perspective on the Games I know I have tough opponents left to face But I am no longer merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate measures If Cato broke through the trees right now I wouldnt flee Id shoot I find Im actually anticipating the moment with pleasure But first I have to get some strength back in my body Im very dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously low The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself during prep time in the Capitol is gone plus several more pounds as well My hip bones and ribs are more prominent than I remember them being since those awful months after my fathers death And then there are my wounds to contend with burns cuts and bruises from smashing into the trees and three tracker jacker stings which are as sore and swollen as ever I treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a bit on my stings as well but it has no effect on them My mother knew a treatment for them some type of leaf that could draw out the poison but she seldom had cause to use it and I dont even remember its name let alone its appearance Water first I think You can hunt along the way now Its easy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruction my crazed body made through the foliage So I walk off in the otherdirection hoping my enemies still lie locked in the surreal world of tracker jacker venom I cant move too quickly my joints reject any abrupt motions But I establish the slow hunters tread I use when tracking game Within a few minutes I spot a rabbit and make my first kill with the bow and arrow Its not my usual clean shot through the eye but Ill take it After about an hour I find a stream shallow but wide and more than sufficient for my needs The suns hot and severe so while Iwait for my water to purify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into the mild current Im filthy from head to toe I try splashing myself but eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes letting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started to peel off my burns After rinsing out my clothes and hanging them on bushes to dry I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit untangling my hair with my fingers My appetite returns and I eat a cracker and a strip of beef With a handful of moss I polish the blood from my silver weapons Refreshed I treat my burns again braid back my hair and dress in the damp clothes knowing the sun will dry them soon enough Following the stream against its current seems the smartest course ofaction Im traveling uphill now which I prefer with a source of fresh water not only for myself but possible game I easily take out a strange bird that must be some form of wild turkey Anyway it looks plenty edible to me By late afternoon I decide to build a small fire to cook the meat betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and I can quench the fire by nightfall I clean the game taking extra care with the bird but theres nothing alarming about it Once the feathers are plucked its no bigger than a chicken but its plump and firm Ive just placed the first lot over the coals when I hear the twig snap In one motion I turn to the sound bringing the bow and arrow to my shoulder Theres no one there No one I can see anyway Then I spot the tip of a childs boot just peeking out from behind the trunk of a tree My shoulders relax and I grin She can move through the woods like a shadow you have to give her that How else could she have followed me The words come out of my mouth before I can stop them You know theyre not the only ones who can form alliances I say For a moment no response Then one of Rues eyes edges around the trunk You want me for an ally Why not You saved me with those tracker jackers Youre smart enough to still be alive And I cant seem to shake you anyway I say She blinks at metrying to decide You hungry I can see her swallow hard her eye flickering to the meat Come on then Ive had two kills today Rue tentatively steps out into the open I can fix your stings Can you I ask How She digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of leaves Im almost certain theyre the ones my mother uses Whered you find those Just around We all carry them when we work in the orchards They left a lot of nests there says Rue There are a lot here too Thats right Youre District Eleven Agriculture I say Orchards huh That must be how you can fly around the trees like youve got wings Rue smiles Ive landed on one of the few things shell admit pride in Well come on then Fix me up I plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal the sting on my knee To my surprise Rue places the handful of leaves into her mouth and begins to chewthem My mother would use other methods but its not like we have a lot of options After a minute or so Rue presses a gloppy green wad of chewed leaves and spit on my knee Ohhh The sound comes out of my mouth before I can stop it Its as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right out of the sting Rue gives a giggleLucky you had the sense to pull the stingers out or youd be a lot worse Do my neck Do my cheek I almost beg Rue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth and soon Im laughing because the relief is so sweet I notice a long burn on Rues forearm Ive got something for that I set aside my weapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine You have good sponsors she says longingly Have you gotten anything yet I ask She shakes her head You will though Watch The closer we get to the end the more people will realize how clever you are I turn the meat over You werent joking about wanting me for an ally she asks No I meant it I say I can almost hear Haymitch groaning as I team up with this wispy child But I want her Because shes a survivor and I trust her and why not admit it She reminds me of Prim Okay she says and holds out her hand We shake Its a deal Of course this kind of deal can only be temporary but neither of us mentions that Rue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root to the meal Roasted over the fire they have the sharp sweet taste of a parsnip She recognizes the bird too some wild thing they call a groosling in her district She says sometimes a flock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch that day For a while all conversation stops aswe fill our stomachs The groosling has delicious meal thats so fatty the grease drips down your face when you bite into it Oh says Rue with a sigh Ive never had a whole leg to myself before Ill bet she hasnt Ill bet meat hardly ever comes her way Take the other I say Really she asks Take whatever you want Now that Ive got a bow and arrows I can get more Plus Ive got snares I can show you how to set them I say Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg Oh take it I say putting the drumstick in her hands It will only keep a few days anyway and weve got the whole bird plus the rabbit Once shes got hold of it her appetite wins out and she takes a huge mouthful Id have thought in District Eleven youd have a bit more to eat than us You know since you grow the food I say Rues eyes widen Oh no were not allowed to eat the crops They arrest you or something I ask They whip you and make everyone else watch says Rue The mayors very strict about it I can tell by her expression that its not that uncommon an occurrence A public whippings a rare thing in District  although occasionally one occurs Technically Gale and I could be whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods well technically we could get a whole lot worse except all the officials buy our meat Besides ourmayor Madges father doesnt seem to have much taste for such events Maybe being the least prestigious poorest most ridiculed district in the country has its advantages Such as being largely ignored by the Capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas Do you get all the coal you want Rue asks No I answer Just what we buy and whatever we track in on our boots They feed us a bit extra during harvest so that people can keep going longer says Rue Dont you have to be in school I ask Not during harvest Everyone works then says Rue Its interesting hearing about her life We have so little communication with anyone outside our district In fact I wonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out our conversation because even though the information seems harmless they dont want people in different districts to know about one another At Rues suggestion we lay out all our food to plan ahead Shes seen most of mine but I add the last couple of crackers and beef strips to the pile Shes gathered quite a collection of roots nuts greens and even some berries I roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers You sure this is safe Oh yes we have them back home Ive been eating them for days she says popping a handful in her mouth I tentatively bite into one and its as good as our blackberries Taking Rue on as an allyseems a better choice all the time We divide up our food supplies so in case were separated well both be set for a few days Apart from the food Rue has a small water skin a homemade slingshot and an extra pair of socks She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife I know its not much she says as if embarrassed but I had to get away from the Cornucopia fast You did just right I say When I spread out my gear she gasps a little when she sees the sunglasses How did you get those she asks In my pack Theyve been useless so far They dont block the sun and they make it harder to see I say with a shrug These arent for sun theyre for darkness exclaims Rue Sometimes when we harvest through the night theyll pass out a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees Where the torchlight doesnt reach One time this boy Martin he tried to keep his pair Hid it in his pants They killed him on the spot They killed a boy for taking these I say Yes and everyone knew he was no danger Martin wasnt right in the head I mean he still acted like a threeyearold He just wanted the glasses to play with says Rue Hearing this makes me feel like District  is some sort of safe haven Of course people keel over from starvation all the time but I cant imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a simpleminded child Theres a littlegirl one of Greasy Saes grandkids who wanders around the Hob Shes not quite right but shes treated as a sort of pet People toss her scraps and things So what do these do I ask Rue taking the glasses They let you see in complete darkness says Rue Try them tonight when the sun goesdown I give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have plenty of leaves in case my stings flare up again We extinguish our fire and head upstream until its almost nightfall Where do you sleep I ask her In the trees She nods In just your jacket Rue holds up her extra pair of socks I have these for my hands I think of how cold the nights have been You can share my sleeping bag if you want Well both easily fit Her face lights up I can tell this is more than she dared hope for We pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just as the anthem begins to play There were no deaths today Rue I only woke up today How many nights did I miss The anthem should block out our words but still I whisper I even take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand I dont want the audience to know what Im planning to tell her about Peeta Taking a cue from me she does the same Two she says Thegirls from Districts One and Four are dead Theres ten of us left Something strange happened At least I think it did It might have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine things I say You know the boy from my district Peeta I think he saved my life But he was with the Careers Hes not with them now she says Ive spied on their base camp by the lake They made it back before they collapsed from the stingers But hes not there Maybe he did save you and had to run I dont answer If in fact Peeta did save me Im in his debt again And this cant be paid back If he did it was all probably just part of his act You know to make people think hes in love with me Oh says Rue thoughtfully I didnt think that was an act Course it is I say He worked it out with our mentor The anthem ends and the sky goes dark Lets try out these glasses I pull out the glasses and slip them on Rue wasnt kidding I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a skunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away I could kill it from here if I had a mind to I could kill anyone I wonder who else got a pair of these I say The Careers have two pairs But theyve got everything down by the lake Rue says And theyre so strong Were strong too I say Just in a different way You are You can shoot she says What can I do You can feedyourself Can they I ask They dont need to They have all those supplies Rue says Say they didnt Say the supplies were gone How long would they last I say I mean its the Hunger Games right But Katniss theyre not hungry says Rue No theyre not Thats the problem I agree And for the first time I have a plan A plan that isnt motivated by the need for flight and evasion An offensive plan I think were going to have to fix that RueRue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up against me and falls asleep Nor do I have any misgivings about her as I take no particular precautions If shed wanted me dead all shewould have had to do was disappear from that tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest Needling me at the very back of my mind is the obvious Both of us cant win these Games But since the odds are still against either of us surviving I manage to ignore the thought Besides Im distracted by my latest idea about the Careers and their supplies Somehow Rue and I must find a way to destroy their food Im pretty sure feeding themselves will be a tremendous struggle Traditionally the Career tributes strategy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there The years when they have not protected it well one year a pack of hideous reptiles destroyed it another a Gamemakers flood washed it away those are usually the years that tributes from other districts have won That the Careers have been better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage because they dont know how to be hungry Not the way Rue and I do But Im too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight My wounds recovering my mind still a bit foggy from the venom and the warmth of Rue at my side her head cradled on my shoulder have given me a sense of security I realize for the first time how very lonely Ive been in the arena How comforting the presence of another human being can be I give in to my drowsiness resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn Tomorrow its the Careers who will have to watch their backs The boom of the cannon jolts me awakeThe skys streaked with light the birds already chattering Rue perches in a branch across from me her hands cupping something We wait listening for more shots but there arent any Who do you think that was I cant help thinking of Peeta I dont know It could have been any of the others says Rue I guess well know tonight Whos left again I ask The boy from District One Both tributes from Two The boy from Three Thresh and me And you and Peeta says Rue Thats eight Wait and the boy from Ten the one with the bad leg He makes nine Theres someone else but neither of us can remember who it is I wonder how that last one died says Rue No telling But its good for us A death should hold the crowd for a bit Maybe well have time to do something before the Gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly I say Whats in your hands Breakfast says Rue She holds them out revealing two big eggs What kind are those I ask Not sure Theres a marshy area over that way Some kind of waterbird she says Itd be nice to cook them but neither of us wants to risk a fire My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the Careers which means theyve recovered enough to be back in the Games We each suck out the insides of an egg eat a rabbit leg and some berries Its a good breakfast anywhere Ready to do it I say pulling on my pack Do what says Rue but by the way she bounces up you can tell shes up for whatever I propose Today we take out the Careers food I say ReallyHow You can see the glint of excitement in her eyes In this way shes exactly the opposite of Prim for whom adventures are an ordeal No idea Come on well figure out a plan while we hunt I say We dont get much hunting done though because Im too busy getting every scrap of information I can out of Rue about the Careers base Shes only been in to spy on them briefly but shes observant They have set up their camp beside the lake Their supply stash is about thirty yards away During the day theyve been leaving another tribute the boy from District  to watch over the supplies The boy from District Three I ask Hes working with them Yes he stays at the camp fulltime He got stung too when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake says Rue I guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard But hes not very big What weapons does he have I ask Not much that I could see A spear He might be able to hold a few of us off with that but Thresh could killhim easily says Rue And the foods just out in the open I say She nods Somethings not quite right about that whole setup I know But I couldnt tell what exactly says Rue Katniss even if you could get to the food how would you get rid of it Burn it Dump it in the lake Soak it in fuel I poke Rue in the belly just like I would Prim Eat it She giggles Dont worry Ill think of something Destroying things is much easier than making them For a while we dig roots we gather berries and greens we devise a strategy in hushed voices And I come to know Rue the oldest of six kids fiercely protective of her siblings who gives her rations to the younger ones who forages in the meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours Rue who when you ask her what she loves most in the world replies of all things Music Music I say In our world I rank music somewhere between hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness At least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather You have a lot of time for that We sing at home At work too Thats why I love your pin she says pointing to the mockingjay that Ive again forgotten about You have mockingjays I ask Oh yes I have a few that are my special friends We can sing back and forth for hours They carry messages for me she says What do you mean I say Im usually up highest so Im the first to see the flag that signals quitting time Theres a special little song I do says Rue She opens her mouth and sings a little fournote run in a sweet clear voice And the mockingjays spread it around the orchard Thats how everyone knows to knock off she continues They can be dangerous though if you get too near their nests But you cant blame them for that I unclasp the pin and hold it out to her Here you take it It has more meaning for you than me Oh no says Rue closing my fingers back over the pin I like to see it on you Thats how I decided I could trust youBesides I have this She pulls a necklace woven out of some kind of grass from her shirt On it hangs a roughly carved wooden star Or maybe its a flower Its a good luck charm Well its worked so far I say pinning the mockingjay back on my shirt Maybe you should just stick with that By lunch we have a plan By early afternoon we are poised to carry it out I help Rue collect and place the wood for the first two campfires the third shell have time for on her own We decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first meal together The stream should help guide me backto it Before I leave I make sure Rues well stocked with food and matches I even insist she take my sleeping bag in case its not possible to rendezvous by nightfall What about you Wont you be cold she asks Not if I pick up another bag down by the lake I say You know stealing isnt illegal here I say with a grin At the last minute Rue decides to teach me her mockingjay signal the one she gives to indicate the days work is done It might not work But if you hear the mockingjays singing it youll know Im okay only I cant get back right away Are there many mockingjays here I ask Havent you seen them Theyve got nests everywhere she says I have to admit I havent noticed Okay then If all goes according to plan Ill see you for dinner I say Unexpectedly Rue throws her arms around me I only hesitate a moment before I hug her back You be careful she says to me You too I say I turn and head back to the stream feeling somehow worried About Rue being killed about Rue not being killed and the two of us being left for last about leaving Rue alone about leaving Prim alone back home No Prim has my mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she wont go hungry Rue has only me Once I reach the stream I have only to follow it downhill to the place I initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack I have to be cautious as I move along the water though because I find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered questions most of which concern Peeta The cannon that fired early this morning did that signify his death If so how did he die At the hand of a Career And was that in revenge for letting me live I struggle again to remember that moment over Glimmers body when he burst through the trees But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened I must have been moving very slowly yesterday because I reach the shallow stretch where I took my bath in just a few hours I stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to my backpack It seems bent on reverting to orange no matter how many times I cover it My proximity to the Careers camp sharpens my senses and the closer I get to them the more guarded I am pausing frequently to listen for unnatural sounds an arrow already fitted into the string of my bow I dont see any other tributes but I do notice some of the things Rue has mentionedPatches of the sweet berries A bush with the leaves that healed my stings Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the tree I was trapped in And hereand there the blackandwhite flash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head When I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot I pause a moment to gather my courage Rue has given specific instructions on how to reach the best spying place near the lake from this point Remember I tell myself Youre the hunter now not them I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on I make it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to admire her cleverness Its right at the edge of the wood but the bushy foliage is so thick down low I can easily observe the Career camp without being spotted Between us lies the flat expanse where the Games began There are four tributes The boy from District  Cato and the girl from District  and a scrawny ashenskinned boy who must be from District  He made almost no impression on me at all during our time in the Capitol I can remember almost nothing about him not his costume not his training score not his interview Even now as he sits there fiddling with some kind of plastic box hes easily ignored in the presence of his large and domineering companions But he must be of some value or they wouldnt have bothered to let him live Still seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over why the Careers would possibly leave him as a guard why they have allowed him to live at all All four tributes seem to still be recovering from the tracker jacker attack Even from here I can see the large swollen lumps on their bodies They must not have had the sense to remove the stingers or if they did not known about the leaves that healed them Apparently whatever medicines they found in the Cornucopia have been ineffective The Cornucopia sits in its original position but its insides have been picked clean Most of the supplies held in crates burlap sacks and plastic bins are piled neatly in a pyramid in what seems a questionable distance from the camp Others are sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid almost mimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the onset of the Games A canopy of netting that aside from discouraging birds seems to be useless shelters the pyramid itself The whole setup is completely perplexing The distance the netting and the presence of the boy from District  One things for sure destroying those supplies is not going to be as simple as it looks Some other factor is at play here and Id better stay put until I figure out what it is My guess is the pyramid is boobytrapped in some manner I think of concealed pits descending nets a thread that when broken sends a poisonous dart into your heart Really thepossibilities are endless While I am mulling over my options I hear Cato shout out Hes pointing up to the woods far beyond me and without turning I knowthat Rue must have set the first campfire Wed made sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke noticeable The Careers begin to arm themselves at once An argument breaks out Its loud enough for me to hear that it concerns whether or not the boy from District  should stay or accompany them Hes coming We need him in the woods and his jobs done here anyway No one can touch those supplies says Cato What about Lover Boy says the boy from District  I keep telling you forget about him I know where I cut him Its a miracle he hasnt bled to death yet At any rate hes in no shape to raid us says Cato So Peeta is out there in the woods wounded badly But I am still in the dark on what motivated him to betray the Careers Come on says Cato He thrusts a spear into the hands of the boy from District  and they head off in the direction of the fire The last thing I hear as they enter the woods is Cato saying When we find her I kill her in my own way and no one interferes Somehow I dont think hes talking about Rue She didnt drop a nest of acker jackers on him I stay put for a half an hour or so trying to figure out what to do about the supplies The one advantage I have with the bow and arrow is distance I could send a flaming arrow into the pyramid easily enough Im a good enough shot to get it through those openings in the net but theres no guarantee it would catch More likely itd just burn itself out and then what Id have achieved nothing and given them far too much information about myself That I was here that I have an accomplice that I can use the bow and arrow with accuracy Theres no alternative Im going to have to get in closer and see if I cant discover what exactly protects the supplies In fact Im just about to reveal myself when a movement catches my eye Several hundred yards to my right I see someone emerge from the woods For a second I think its Rue but then I recognize Foxface shes the one we couldnt remember this morning creeping out onto the plain When she decides its safe she runs for the pyramid with quick small steps Just before she reaches the circle of supplies that have been littered around the pyramid she stops searches the ground and carefully places her feet on a spot Then she begins to approach the pyramid with strange little hops sometimes landing on one foot teetering slightlysometimes risking a few steps At one point she launches up in the air over a small barrel and lands poised on her tiptoes But she overshot slightly and her momentum throws her forward I hear her give a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground but nothing happens In a moment shes regained her feet and continues until she has reached the bulk of the supplies So Im right about the booby trap but its clearly more complex than I had imagined I was right about the girl too How wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and to be able to replicate it so neatly She fills herpack taking a few items from a variety of containers crackers from a crate a handful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended from a rope off the side of a bin But only a handful from each not enough to tip off that the food is missing Not enough to cause suspicion And then shes doing her odd little dance back out of the circle and scampering into the woods again safe and sound I realize Im grinding my teeth in frustration Foxface has confirmed what Id already guessed But what sort of trap have they laid that requires such dexterity Has so many trigger points Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact with the earth Youd have thought    And slowly it begins to dawn on me    Youd have thought the very ground was going to explode Its mined I whisper That explains everything The Careers willingness to leave their supplies Foxfaces reaction the involvement of the boy from District  where they have the factories where they make televisions and automobiles and explosives But where did he get them In the supplies Thats not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually provide given that they like to see the tributes draw blood personally I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round metal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena The ground around it has been dug up and patted back down The land mines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the plates but the boy from District  must have managed to reactivate them Ive never seen anyone in the Games do that I bet it came as a shock even to the Gamemakers Well hurray for the boy from District  for putting one over on them but what am I supposed to do now Obviously I cant go strolling into that mess without blowing myself skyhigh As for sending in a burning arrow thats more laughable than ever The mines are set off by pressure It doesnt have to be a lot either One year a girldropped her token a small wooden ball while she was at her plate and they literally had to scrape bits of her off the ground My arms pretty good I might be able to chuck some rocks in there and set off what Maybe one mine That could start a chain reaction Or could it Would the boy from District  have placed the mines in such a way that a single mine would not disturb the others Thereby protecting the supplies but ensuring the death of the invader Even if I only blew up one mine Id draw the Careers back down on me for sure And anyway what am I thinking Theres that net clearly strung to deflect any such attack Besides what Id really need is to throw about thirty rocks in there at once setting off a big chain reaction demolishing the whole lot I glance back up at the woods The smoke from Rues second fire is wafting toward the sky By now the Careers have probably begun to suspect some sort of trick Time is running out There is a solution to this I know there is if I can only focus hard enough I stare at the pyramid thebins the crates too heavy to topple over with an arrow Maybe one contains cooking oil and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I could end uplosing all twelve of my arrows and not get a direct hit on an oil bin since Id just be guessing Im genuinely thinking of trying to recreate Foxfaces trip up to the pyramid in hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes light on the burlap bag of apples I could sever the rope in one shot didnt I do as much in the Training Center Its a big bag but it still might only be good for one explosion If only I could free the apples themselves    I know what to do I move into range and give myself three arrows to get the job done I place my feet carefully block out the rest of the world as I take meticulous aim The first arrow tears through the side of the bag near the top leaving a split in the burlap The second widens it to a gaping hole I can see the first apple teetering when I let the third arrow go catching the torn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag For a moment everything seems frozen in time Then the apples spill to the ground and Im blown backward into the airThe impact with the hardpacked earth of the plain knocks the wind out of meMy backpack does little to soften the blow Fortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow sparing both itself and my shoulder and my bow is locked in my grasp The ground still shakes with explosions I cant hear them I cant hear anything at the moment But the apples must have set off enough mines causing debris to activate the others I manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter some of it burning rain down around me An acrid smoke fills the air which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe After about a minute the ground stops vibrating I roll on my side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of the smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid The Careers arent likely to salvage anything out of that Id better get out of here I think Theyll be making a beeline for the place But once Im on my feet I realize escape may not be so simple Im dizzy Not the slightly wobbly kind but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the earth to move in waves under your feet I take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and knees I wait a few minutes to let it pass but it doesnt Panic begins to set in I cant stay here Flight is essential But I can neither walk nor hear I place a hand to my left ear theone that was turned toward the blast and it comes away bloody Have I gone deaf from the explosion The idea frightens me I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter maybe more at times But I cant let my fear show Absolutely positively I am live on every screen in Panem No blood trails I tell myself and manage to pull my hood up over my head tie the cord under my chin with uncooperativefingers That should help soak up the blood I cant walk but can I crawl I move forward tentatively Yes if I go very slowly I can crawl Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover My only hope is to make it back to Rues copse and conceal myself in greenery I cant get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open Not only will I face death its sure to be a long and painful one at Catos hand The thought of Prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout Another blast knocks me flat on my face A stray mine set off by some collapsing crate This happens twice more Im reminded of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and I pop corn over the fire at home To say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement I have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes atthe base of the trees when theres Cato barreling onto the plain soon followed by his companions His rage is so extreme it might be comical so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists if I didnt know that it was aimed at me at what I have done to him Add to that my proximity my inability to run or defend myself and in fact the whole thing has me terrified Im glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because Im biting my nails like theres no tomorrow Gnawing off the last bits of nail polish trying to keep my teeth from chattering The boy from District  throws stones into the ruins and must have declared all the mines activated because the Careers are approaching the wreckage Cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers The other tributes are poking around in the mess looking for anything to salvage but theres nothing The boy from District  has done his job too well This idea must occur to Cato too because he turns on the boy and appears to be shouting at him The boy from District  only has time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind I can see the muscles ripple in Catos arms as he sharply jerks the boys head to the sideIts that quick The death of the boy from District  The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down I can tell he wants to return to the woods but they keep pointing at the sky which puzzles me until I realize Of course They think whoever set off the explosions is dead They dont know about the arrows and the apples They assume the booby trap was faulty but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it If there was a cannon shot it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from District  And they wait I suppose a cannon goes off A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy The sun dips belowthe horizon Night falls Up in the sky I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun A moment of darkness They show the boy from District  They show the boy from District  who must have died this morning Then the seal reappears So now they know The bomber survived In the seals light I can see Cato and the girl from District  put on their nightvision glasses The boy from District  ignites atree branch for a torch illuminating the grim determination on all their faces The Careers stride back into the woods to hunt The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deafened I can hear a ringing in my right which seems a good sign Theres no point in leaving my hiding place though Im about as safe as I can be here at the crime scene They probably think the bomber has a two or threehour lead on them Still its a long time before I risk moving The first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them on which relaxes me a little to have at least one of my hunters senses working I drink some water and wash the blood from my ear Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators fresh blood is bad enough I make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered today Where is my little ally Did she make it back to the rendezvous point Is she worried about me At least the sky has shown were both alive I run through the surviving tributes on my fingers The boy from  both from  Foxface both from  and  Just eight of us The betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol Theyll be doing special features on each of us now Probably interviewing our friends and families Its been a long time since a tribute from District  made it into the top eight And now there are twoof us Although from what Cato said Peetas on his way out Not that Cato is the final word on anything Didnt he just lose his entire stash of supplies Let the Seventyfourth Hunger Games begin Cato I think Let them begin for real A cold breeze has sprung up I reach for my sleeping bag before I remember I left it with Rue I was supposed to pick up another one but what with the mines and all I forgot I begin to shiver Since roosting overnight in a tree isnt sensible anyway I scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself with leaves and pine needles Im still freezing I lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind Its a little better I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from District  that lit the fire that first night But now its me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning More leaves more pine needles I pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest Somehow I drift off to sleep When I open my eyes the world looks slightly fractured and it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up and the glasses fragmenting my vision As I sit up and remove them I hear a laugh somewhere nearthe lake and freeze The laughs distorted but the fact that it registered at all means I must be regaining my hearing Yes my right ear can hear again although its still ringing As for my left ear well at least the bleeding has stopped I peer through the bushes afraid the Careers have returned trapping me here for an indefinite time No its Foxface standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing Shes smarter than the Careers actually finding a few useful items in the ashes A metal pot A knife blade Im perplexed by her amusement until I realize that with the Careers stores eliminated she might actually stand a chance Just like the rest of us It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack But I rule it out Theres something about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back With that in mind this might be an excellent time to shoot her But shes heard something not me because her head turns away toward the dropoff and she sprints for the woods I wait No one nothing shows up Still if Foxface thought it was dangerous maybe its time for me to get out of here too Besides Im eager to tell Rue about the pyramid Since Ive no idea where the Careers are the route back by the stream seems as good as any Ihurry loaded bow in one hand a hunk of cold groosling in the other because Im famished now and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the meat The trip to the stream is uneventful Once there I refill my water and wash taking particular care with my injured ear Then I travel uphill using the stream as a guide At one point I find boot prints in the mud along the bank The Careers have been here but not for a while The prints are deep because they were made in soft mud but now theyre nearly dry in the hot sun I havent been careful enough about my own tracks counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints Now I strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream The cool water has an invigorating effect on my body my spirits I shoot two fish easy pickings in this slowmoving stream and go ahead and eat one raw even though Ive just had the groosling The second Ill save for Rue Gradually subtly the ringing in my right ear diminishes until its gone entirely I find myself pawing at my left ear periodically trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds If theres improvement its undetectable I cant adjust to deafness in the ear It makes me feel offbalanced and defenseless to my left Blind even My head keeps turning tothe injured side as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant flow of information The more time that passes the less hopeful I am that this is an injury that will heal When I reach the site of our first meeting I feel certain its beenundisturbed Theres no sign of Rue not on the ground or in the trees This is odd By now she should have returned as its midday Undoubtedly she spent the night in a tree somewhere What else could she do with no light and the Careers with their nightvision glasses tramping around the woods And the third fire she was supposed to set although I forgot to check for it last night was the farthest from our site of all Shes probably just being cautious about making her way back I wish shed hurry because I dont want to hang around here too long I want to spend the afternoon traveling to higher ground hunting as we go But theres nothing really for me to do but wait I wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my evergrowing list of wounds The burns are much better but I use a bit of medicine on them anyway The main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection I go ahead andeat the second fish It isnt going to last long in this hot sun but it should be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue If she would just show up Feeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided hearing I scale a tree to wait If the Careers show up this will be a fine place to shoot them from The sun moves slowly I do things to pass the time Chew leaves and apply them to my stings that are deflated but still tender Comb through my damp hair with my fingers and braid it Lace my boots back up Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows Test my left ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it but without good results Despite the groosling and the fish my stomachs growling and I know Im going to have what we call a hollow day back in District  Thats a day where no matter what you put in your belly its never enough Having nothing to do but sit in a tree makes it worse so I decide to give into it After all Ive lost a lot of weight in the arena I need some extra calories And having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident about my future prospects I slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts My last cracker The groosling neck Thats good because it takes time to pick clean Finally a groosling wing and the bird is history But its a hollow day and even with all that I start daydreaming about foodParticularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol The chicken in creamy orange sauce The cakes and pudding Bread with butter Noodles in green sauce The lamb and dried plum stew I suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get over it Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over Sort of Dangling up in the tree with the sun warming me a mouthful of mint my bow and arrows at hand    This is the most relaxed Ive been since Ive entered the arena If only Rue would show up and we could clear out As the shadows grow so does my restlessness By late afternoon Ive resolved to go looking for her I can at least visit the spotwhere she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts Before I go I scatter a few mint leaves around our old campfire Since we gathered these some distance away Rue will understand Ive been here while theyll mean nothing to the Careers In less than an hour Im at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and I know something has gone amiss The wood has been neatly arranged expertly interspersed with tinder but it has never been lit Rue set up thefire but never made it back here Somewhere between the second column of smoke I spied before I blew up the supplies and this point she ran into trouble I have to remind myself shes still alive Or is she Could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up Will she appear in the sky tonight No I refuse to believe it There could be a hundred other explanations She could have lost her way Run into a pack of predators or another tribute like Thresh and had to hide Whatever happened Im almost certain shes stuck out there somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet Something is keeping her up a tree I think Ill go hunt it down Its a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon I creep silently through the shadows letting them conceal me But nothing seems suspicious Theres no sign of any kind of struggle no disruption of the needles on the ground Ive stopped for just a moment when I hear it I have to cock my head around to the side to be sure but there it is again Rues fournote tune coming out of a mockingjays mouth The one that means shes all right I grin and move in the direction of the bird Another just a short distance ahead picks up on the handful of notes Rue has beensinging to them and recently Otherwise theyd have taken up some other song My eyes lift up into the trees searching for a sign of her I swallow and sing softly back hoping shell know its safe to join me A mockingjay repeats the melody to me And thats when I hear the scream Its a childs scream a young girls scream theres no one in the arena capable of making that sound except Rue And now Im running knowing this may be a trap knowing the three Careers may be poised to attack me but I cant help myself Theres another highpitched cry this time my name Katniss Katniss Rue I shout back so she knows Im near So they know Im near and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with tracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still cant explain will be enough to pull their attention away from her Rue Im coming When I break into the clearing shes on the ground hopelessly entangled in a net She just has time to reach her hand through the mesh and say my name before the spear enters her bodyThe boy from District  dies before he can pull out the spear My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck He falls to his knees andhalves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood Im reloaded shifting my aim from side to side while I shout at Rue Are there more Are there more She has to say no several times before I hear it Rue has rolled to her side her body curved in and around the spear I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife freeing her from the net One look at the wound and I know its far beyond my capacity to heal beyond anyones probably The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach I crouch before her staring helplessly at the embedded weapon Theres no point in comforting words in telling her shell be all right Shes no fool Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline As if its me whos dying instead of Rue You blew up the food she whispers Every last bit I say You have to win she says Im going to Going to win for both of us now I promise I hear a cannon and look up It must be for the boy from District  Dont go Rue tightens her grip on my hand Course not Staying right here I say I move in closerto her pulling her head onto my lap I gently brush the dark thick hair back behind her ear Sing she says but I barely catch the word Sing I think Sing what I do know a few songs Believe it or not there was once music in my house too Music I helped make My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice but I havent sung much since he died Except when Prim is very sick Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby Sing My throat is tight with tears hoarse from smoke and fatigue But if this is Prims I mean Rues last request I have to at least try The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby one we sing fretful hungry babies to sleep with Its old very old I think Made up long ago in our hills What my music teacher calls a mountain air But the words are easy and soothing promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today I give a small cough swallow hard and beginDeep in the meadow under the willowA bed of grass a soft green pillowLay down your head and close your sleepy eyesAnd when again they open the sun will riseHere its safe here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love youRues eyes have fluttered shut Her chest moves but only slightly My throat releases the tears and they slide down my cheeks But I have to finish the song for herDeep in the meadow hidden far awayA cloak of leaves a moonbeam rayForget your woes and let your troubles layAnd when again its morning theyll wash awayHere its safe here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmThe final lines are barely audibleHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them trueHere is the place where I love youEverythings still and quiet Then almost eerily the mockingjays take up my song For a moment I sit there watching my tears drip down on her face Rues cannon fires I lean forward and press my lips against her temple Slowly as if not to wake her I lay her head back on the ground and release her hand Theyll want me to clear out now So they can collect the bodies And theres nothing to stay for I roll the boy from District  onto his face and take his pack retrieve the arrow that ended his life I cut Rues pack from her back as well knowing shed want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach Weapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft Ive no use for a spear so the sooner its gone from the arena the better I cant stop looking at Rue smaller than ever a baby animal curled up in a nest of netting I cant bring myself to leave her like this Past harm but seeming utterly defenseless To hate the boy from District  who also appears so vulnerable in death seems inadequate Its the Capitol I hate for doing this to all of us Gales voice is in my head His ravings against the Capitol no longer pointless no longer to be ignored Rues death has forced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty the injustice they inflict upon us But here even more strongly than at home I feel my impotenceTheres no way to take revenge on the Capitol Is there Then I remember Peetas words on the roof Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to    To show the Capital they dont own me That Im more than just a piece in their Games And for the first time I understand what he means I want to do something right here right now to shame them to make them accountable to show the Capitol that whatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tribute they cant own That Rue was more than a piece in their Games And so am I A few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers Perhaps they are really weeds of some sort but they have blossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white I gather up an armful and come back to Rues side Slowly one stem at a time I decorate her body in the flowers Covering the ugly wound Wreathing her face Weaving her hair with bright colors Theyll have to show it Or even if they choose to turn the cameras elsewhere at this moment theyll have to bring them back when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her then and know I did it I step back and take a last look at Rue She could really be asleep in that meadow after all Bye Rue I whisper I press the three middle fingers of my left hand against my lips and hold them out in herdirection Then I walk away without looking back The birds fall silent Somewhere a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft I dont know how it knows It must hearthings that humans cant I pause my eyes focused on whats ahead not whats happening behind me It doesnt take long then the general birdsong begins again and I know shes gone Another mockingjay a young one by the look of it lands on a branch before me and bursts out Rues melody My song the hovercraft were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up but it has mastered her handful of notes The ones that mean shes safe Good and safe I say as I pass under its branch We dont have to worry about her now Good and safe Ive no idea where to go The brief sense of home I had that one night with Rue has vanished My feet wander this way and that until sunset Im not afraid not even watchful Which makes me an easy target Except Id kill anyone I met on sight Without emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands My hatred of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competitors in the least Especially the Careers They at least can be made to pay for Rues death No one materializes though There arent many of us left and its a big arena Soon theyll be pulling out some other device to force us together But theres been enough gore today Perhaps well even get to sleep Im about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me A gift from a sponsor But why now Ive been in fairly good shape with supplies Maybe Haymitchs noticed my despondency and is trying to cheer me up a bit Or could it be something to help my ear I open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread Its not the fine white Capitol stuff Its made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent Sprinkled with seeds I flash back to Peetas lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center This bread came from District  I cautiously lift the still warm loaf What must it have cost the people of District  who cant even feed themselves How many wouldve had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf It had been meant for Rue surely But instead of pulling the gift when she died theyd authorized Haymitch to give it to me As a thankyou Or because like me they dont like to let debts go unpaid For whatever reason this is a first A district gift to a tribute whos not your own I lift my face and step into the last falling rays ofsunlight My thanks to the people of District Eleven I say I want them to know I know where it came from That the full value of their gift has been recognized I climb dangerously high into a tree not for safety but to get as far away from today as I can My sleeping bag is rolled neatly in Rues pack Tomorrow Ill sort through the supplies Tomorrow Ill make a new plan But tonight all I can do is strap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread Its good It tastes of home Soon the seals in the sky the anthem plays in my right ear I see the boy from District  Rue Thats all for tonight Six of us left I think Only six Withthe bread still locked in my hands I fall asleep at once Sometimes when things are particularly bad my brain will give me a happy dream A visit with my father in the woods An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim Tonight it sends me Rue still decked in her flowers perched in a high sea of trees trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays I see no sign of her wounds no blood just a bright laughing girl She sings songs Ive never heard in a clear melodic voice On and on Through the night Theres a drowsy inbetween period when I can hear the last few strains of her music although shes lost in the leaves When I fully awaken Im momentarily comforted I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream but it quickly slips away leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever Heaviness infuses my whole body as if theres liquid lead in my veins Ive lost the will to do the simplest tasks to do anything but lie here staring unblinkingly through the canopy of leaves For several hours I remain motionless As usual its the thought of Prims anxious face as she watches me on the screens back home that breaks me from my lethargy I give myself a series of simple commands to follow like Now you have to sit up Katniss Now you have to drink water Katniss I act on the orders with slow robotic motions Now you have to sort the packs Katniss Rues pack holds my sleeping bag her nearly empty water skin a handful of nuts and roots a bit of rabbit her extra socks and her slingshot The boy from District  has several knives two spare spearheads a flashlight a small leather pouch a firstaid kit a full bottle of water and a pack of dried fruit A pack of dried fruit Out of all he might have chosen from To me this is a sign of extreme arrogance Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp When you will kill your enemies so quickly youll be home before yourehungry I can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing Speaking of which my own supply is running low I finish off the loaf from District  and the last of the rabbit How quickly the food disappears All I have left are Rues roots and nuts the boys dried fruit and one strip of beef Now you have to hunt Katniss I tell myself I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack After I climb down the tree I conceal the boys knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them Ive lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did yesterday evening but I try and head back in the general direction of the stream I know Im on course when I come across Rues third unlit fire Shortly thereafter I discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them I return to Rues signal fire and start it up not caring about the excessive smoke Where are you Cato I think as I roast the birds and Rues roots Imwaiting right here Who knows where the Careers are now Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or  Is it possible Too scared of me They know I have the bow and arrows of course Cato saw me take them from Glimmers body but have they put two and two together yet Figured out I blew up the supplies and killed their fellow Career Possibly they think Thresh did this Wouldnt he be more likely to revenge Rues death than I would Being from the same district Not that he ever took any interest in her And what about Foxface Did she hang around to watch me blow up the supplies No When I caught her laughing in the ashes the next morning it was as if someone had given her a lovely surprise I doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire Catos sure hes as good as dead I find myself wishing I could tell Peeta about the flowers I put on Rue That I now understand what he was trying to say on the roof Perhaps if he wins the Games hell see me on victors night when they replay the highlights of the Games on a screen over the stage where we did our interviews The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform surrounded by their support crew But I told Rue Id be there For both of us And somehow that seems even more important than the vow I gave Prim I really think I stand a chance of doing it nowWinning Its not just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few times although those things help Something happened when I was holding Rues hand watching the life drain out of her Now I am determined to revenge her to make her loss unforgettable and I can only do that by winning and thereby making myself unforgettable I overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot but no one does Maybe the other tributes are out there beating one another senseless Which would be fine Ever since the bloodbath Ive been featured on screens most than I care Eventually I wrap up my food and go back to the stream to replenish my water and gather some But the heaviness from the morning drapes back over me and even though its only early evening I climb a tree and settle in for the night My brain begins to replay the events from yesterday I keep seeing Rue speared my arrow piercing the boys neck I dont know why I should even care about the boy Then I realize    He was my first kill Along with other statistics they report to help people place their bets every tribute has a list of kills I guess technically Id get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District  too for dumping that nest on them But the boy from District  was the first person I knew would die because of my actionsNumerous animals have lost their lives at my hands but only one human I hear Gale saying How different can it be really Amazingly similar in the execution A bow pulled an arrow shot Entirely different in the aftermath I killed a boy whose name I dont even know Somewhere his family is weeping for him His friendscall for my blood Maybe he had a girlfriend who really believed he would come back    But then I think of Rues still body and Im able to banish the boy from my mind At least for now Its been an uneventful day according to the sky No deaths I wonder how long well get until the next catastrophe drives us back together If its going to be tonight I want to get some sleep first I cover my good ear to block out the strains of the anthem but then I hear the trumpets and sit straight up in anticipation For the most part the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll But occasionally there will be trumpets followed by an announcement Usually this will be a call to a feast When food is scarce the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia as an inducement to gather and fight Sometimes there is a feastand sometimes theres nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for I wouldnt go in for the food but this could be an ideal time to take out a few competitors Claudius Templesmiths voice booms down from overhead congratulating the six of us who remain But he is not inviting us to a feast Hes saying something very confusing Theres been a rule change in the Games A rule change That in itself is mind bending since we dont really have any rules to speak of except dont step off your circle for sixty seconds and the unspoken rule about not eating one another Under the new rule both tributes from the same district will be declared winners if they are the last two alive Claudius pauses as if he knows were not getting it and repeats the change again The news sinks in Two tributes can win this year If theyre from the same district Both can live Both of us can live Before I can stop myself I call out Peetas namePART IIITHE VICTORI clap my hands over my mouth but the sound has already escaped The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing Stupid I tell myself What a stupid thing to do I wait frozen for the woods to come alive with assailants Then I remember theres almost no one left Peeta whos been wounded is now my ally Whatever doubts Ive had about him dissipate because if either of us took the others life now wed be pariahs when we returned to District  In fact I know if I was watching Id loathe any tribute who didnt immediately ally with their district partner Besides it just makes sense to protect each other And in my case being one of the starcrossed lovers from District  its an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors The starcrossed lovers    Peeta must have been playing that angle all along Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules For two tributes to have a shot at winning our romance must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games Nothanks to me All Ive done is managed not to kill Peeta But whatever hes donein the arena he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia Fighting Cato to let me escape Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me Peeta it turns out has never been a danger to me The thought makes me smile I drop my hands and hold my face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it So who is there left to be afraid of Foxface The boy tribute from her district is dead Shes operating alone at night And her strategy has been to evade not attack I dont really think that even if she heard my voice shed do anything but hope someone else would kill me Then theres Thresh All right hes a distinct threat But I havent seen him not once since the Games began I think about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the site of the explosion But she didnt turn to the Woods she turned to whatever lies across from it To that area of the arena that drops off into I dont know what I feel almost certain that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain Hed never have heard me from there and even if he did Im up too high for someone his size to reach So that leaves Cato and the girl from District  who are now surely celebrating the new rule Theyre the onlyones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself Do I run from them now on the chance they heard me call Peetas name No I think Let them come Let them come with their nightvision glasses and their heavy branchbreaking bodies Right into the range of my arrows But I know they wont If they didnt come in daylight to my fire they wont risk what could be another trap at night When they come it will be on their own terms not because Ive let them know my whereabouts Stay put and get some sleep Katniss I instruct myself although I wish I could start tracking Peeta now Tomorrow youll find him I do sleep but in the morning Im extracautious thinking that while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree theyre completely capable of setting an ambush for me I make sure to fully prepare myself for the day eating a big breakfast securing my pack readying my weapons before I descend But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground Today Ill have to be scrupulously careful The Careers will know Im trying to locate Peeta They may well want to wait until I do before they move in If hes as badly wounded as Cato thinks Id be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance But if hes that incapacitated how has he managed to stay alive And how on earth will I find him Itry to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me an indication as to where hes hiding out but nothing rings a bell So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the sunlight yelling at me to run Then Cato appeared hissword drawn And after I was gone he wounded Peeta But how did Peeta get away Maybe hed held out better against the tracker jacker poison than Cato Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape But hed been stung too So how far could he have gotten stabbed and filled with venom And how has he stayed alive all these days since If the wound and the stingers havent killed him surely thirst would have taken him by now And thats when I get my first clue to his whereabouts He couldnt have survived without water I know that from my first few days here He must be hidden somewhere near a source Theres the lake but I find that an unlikely option since its so close to the Careers base camp A few springfed pools But youd really be a sitting duck at one of those And the stream The one that leads from the camp Rue and I made all the way down near the lake and beyond If he stuck to the stream he could change his location and always be near water He could walk in thecurrent and erase any tracks He might even be able to get a fish or two Well its a place to start anyway To confuse my enemies minds I start a fire with plenty of green wood Even if they think its a ruse I hope theyll decide Im hidden somewhere near it While in reality Ill be tracking Peeta The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual The waters cool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream Im tempted to call out Peetas name as I go but decide against it I will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me But hell know Ill be looking right He wont have so low of an opinion of me as to think Id ignore the new rule and keep to myself Would he Hes very hard to predict which might be interesting under different circumstances but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle It doesnt take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to go the Careers camp Theres been no sign of Peeta but this doesnt surprise me Ive been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident If he were nearby surely Id have had some suspicion of it The stream begins to curve to the left into a part of the woods thats new to me Muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in size until Ibegin to feel somewhat trapped It would be no small matter to escape the stream now Fighting off Cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky terrain In fact Ive just about decided Im on the wrong track entirely that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source when I see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder Its long dried now but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties tried to wipe it away Hugging the rocks I move slowly in the direction of the blood searching for him I find a few more bloodstains onewith a few threads of fabric glued to it but no sign of life I break down and say his name in a hushed voice Peeta Peeta Then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to mimic my tones so I stop I give up and climb back down to the stream thinking He must have moved on Somewhere farther down My foot has just broken the surface of the water when I hear a voice You here to finish me off sweetheart I whip around Its come from the left so I cant pick it up very well And the voice was hoarse and weak Still it must have been Peeta Who else in the arena would call mesweetheart My eyes peruse the bank but theres nothing Just mud the plants the base of the rocks Peeta I whisper Where are you Theres no answer Could I just have imagined it No Im certain it was real and very close at hand too Peeta I creep along the bank Well dont step on me I jump back His voice was right under my feet Still theres nothing Then his eyes open unmistakably blue in the brown mud and green leaves I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of white teeth as he laughs Its the final word in camouflage Forget chucking weights around Peeta should have gone into his private session with the Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree Or a boulder Or a muddy bank full of weeds Close your eyes again I order He does and his mouth too and completely disappears Most of what I judge to be his body is actually under a layer of mud and plants His face and arms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible I kneel beside him I guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off Peeta smiles Yes frosting The final defense of the dying Youre not going to die I tell him firmly Says who His voice is so ragged Says me Were on the same team now you know I tell him His eyes open So I heard Nice of you to find whats left of me I pull out my water bottle and give him a drink Did Cato cut you I ask Left legUp high he answers Lets get you in the stream wash you off so I can see what kind of wounds youve got I say Lean down a minute first he says Need to tell you something I lean over and put my good ear to his lips which tickle as he whispers Remember were madly in love so its all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it I jerk my head back but end up laughing Thanks Ill keep it in mind At least hes still able to joke around But when I start to help him to the stream all the levity disappears Its only two feet away how hard can it be Very hard when I realize hes unable to move an inch on his own Hes so weak that the best he can do is not to resist I try to drag him but despite the fact that I know hes doing all he can to keep quiet sharp cries of pain escape him The mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him and I finally have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their clutches Hes still two feet from the water lying there teeth gritted tears cutting trails in the dirt on his face Look Peeta Imgoing to roll you into the stream Its very shallow here okay I say Excellent he says I crouch down beside him No matter what happens I tell myself dont stopuntil hes in the water On three I say One two three I can only manage one full roll before I have to stop because of the horrible sound hes making Now hes on the edge of the stream Maybe this is better anyway Okay change of plans Im not going to put you all the way in I tell him Besides if I get him in who knows if Id ever be able to get him out No more rolling he asks Thats all done Lets get you cleaned up Keep an eye on the woods for me okay I say Its hard to know where to start He so caked with mud and matted leaves I cant even see his clothes If hes wearing clothes The thought makes me hesitate a moment but then I plunge in Naked bodies are no big deal in the arena right Ive got two water bottles and Rues water skin I prop them against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while I pour the third over Peetas body It takes a while but I finally get rid of enough mud to find his clothes I gently unzip his jacket unbutton his shirt and ease them off him His undershirt is so plastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with my knife and drench him again to work it loose Hes badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker jacker stings if you count the one under his ear But I feel a bit better This much I can fix I decide to take care of his upper body first to alleviatesome pain before I tackle whatever damage Cato did to his leg Since treating his wounds seems pointless when hes lying in whats become a mud puddle I manage to prop him up against a boulder He sits there uncomplaining while I wash away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin His flesh is very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and stocky I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker lumps which causes him to wince but the minute I apply the leaves he sighs in relief While he dries in the sun I wash his filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders Then I apply the burn cream to his chest This is when I notice how hot his skin is becoming The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that hes burning with fever I dig through the firstaid kit I got from the boy from District  and find pills that reduce your temperature My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail Swallow these I tell him and he obediently takes the medicine You must be hungry Not really Its funny I havent been hungry for days says Peeta In fact when I offer him groosling he wrinkles his nose at it and turns away Thats when I know how sick he is Peeta we need to get some food in you I insist Itll just come right back up he says The best Ican do is to get him to eat a few bits of dried apple Thanks Im much better really Can I sleep nowKatniss he asks Soon I promise I need to look at your leg first Trying to be as gentle as I can I remove his boots his socks and then very slowly inch his pants off of him I can see the tear Catos sword made in the fabric over his thigh but it in no way prepares me for what lies underneath The deep inflamed gash oozing both blood and pus The swelling of the leg And worst of all the smell of festering flesh I want to run away Disappear into the woods like I did that day they brought the burn victim to our house Go and hunt while my mother and Prim attend to what I have neither the skill nor the courage to face But theres no one here but me I try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when handling particularly bad cases Pretty awful huh says Peeta Hes watching me closely Soso I shrug like its no big deal You should see some of the people they bring my mother from the mines I refrain from saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever shes treating anything worse than a cold Come to think of it I dont even much like to be around coughingFirst thing is to clean it well Ive left on Peetas undershorts because theyre not in bad shape and I dont want to pull them over the swollen thigh and all right maybe the idea of him being naked makes me uncomfortable Thats another thing about my mother and Prim Nakedness has no effect on them gives them no cause for embarrassment Ironically at this point in the Games my little sister would be of far more use to Peeta than I am I scoot my square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of him With each bottle I pour over him the worse the wound looks The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well just one tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat quickly But the gash on his leg    What on earth can I do for that Why dont we give it some air and then    I trail off And then youll patch it up says Peeta He looks almost sorry for me as if he knows how lost I am Thats right I say In the meantime you eat these I put a few dried pear halves in his hand and go back in the stream to wash the rest of his clothes When theyre flattened out and drying I examine the contents of the firstaid kit Its pretty basic stuff Bandages fever pills medicine to calm stomachs Nothing of the caliber Ill need to treat Peeta Were going to have to experiment some I admit I know the tracker jacker leavesdraw out infection so I start with those Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewedup green stuff into the wound pus begins running down the side of his leg I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of my cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a reappearance Katniss Peeta says I meet his eyes knowing my face must be some shade of green He mouths the words How about that kiss I burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting I cant stand it Something wrong he asks a little tooinnocently I    Im no good at this Im not my mother Ive no idea what Im doing and I hate pus I say Euh I allow myself to let out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and apply the second Euuuh How do you hunt he asks Trust me Killing things is much easier than this I say Although for all I know I am killing you Can you speed it up a little he asks No Shut up and eat your pears I say After three applications and what seems like a bucket of pus the wound does look better Now that the swelling has gone down I can see how deep Catos sword cut Right down to the bone What next Dr Everdeen he asks Maybe Ill put some of the burnointment on it I think it helps with infection anyway And wrap it up I say I do and the whole thing seems a lot more manageable covered in clean white cotton Although against the sterile bandage the hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with contagion I pull out Rues backpack Here cover yourself with this and Ill wash your shorts Oh I dont care if you see me says Peeta Youre just like the rest of my family I say I care all right I turn my back and look at the stream until the undershorts splash into the current He must be feeling a bit better if he can throw You know youre kind of squeamish for such a lethal person says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between two rocks I wish Id let you give Haymitch a shower after all I wrinkle my nose at the memory Whats he sent you so far Not a thing says Peeta Then theres a pause as it hits him Why did you get something Burn medicine I say almost sheepishly Oh and some bread I always knew you were his favorite says Peeta Please he cant stand being in the same room with me I say Because youre just alike mutters Peeta I ignore it though because this really isnt the time for me to be insulting Haymitch which is my first impulse I let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out but by late afternoon I dont dare wait any longer I gently shake hisshoulder Peeta weve got to go now Go He seems confused Go where Away from here Downstream maybe Somewhere we can hide you until youre stronger I say I help him dress leaving his feet bare so we can walk in the water and pull him upright His face drains of color the moment he puts weight on his leg Come on You can do this But he cant Not for long anyway We make it about fifty yards downstream with him propped up by my shoulder and I can tell hes going to black out I sit him on the bank push his head between his knees and pat his back awkwardly as I survey the area Of course Id love to get him up in a tree but thats not going to happen It could be worse though Some of the rocks form small cavelike structures I set my sights on one about twenty yards above the stream When Peetas able to stand I halfguide halfcarry him up to the cave Really Id like to look around for a better place but this one will have to do because myally is shot Paper white panting and even though its only just cooling off hes shivering I cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles unroll my sleeping bag and tuck him into it I get a couple of pills and some water into himwhen hes not noticing but he refuses to eat even the fruit Then he just lies there his eyes trained on my face as I build a sort of blind out of vines to conceal the mouth of the cave The result is unsatisfactory An animal might not question it but a human would see hands had manufactured it quickly enough I tear it down in frustration Katniss he says I go over to him and brush the hair back from his eyes Thanks for finding me You would have found me if you could I say His foreheads burning up Like the medicines having no effect at all Suddenly out of nowhere Im scared hes going to die Yes Look if I dont make it back he begins Dont talk like that I didnt drain all that pus for nothing I say I know But just in case I dont he tries to continue No Peeta I dont even want to discuss it I say placing my fingers on his lips to quiet him But I he insists Impulsively I lean forward and kiss him stopping his words This is probably overdue anyway since hes right we are supposed to be madly in love Its the first time Ive ever kissed a boy which should make some sort of impression I guess but all I can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever I break away and pull the edge of the sleeping bag up around him Youre not going to die I forbid it All right All right he whispers I step out in the coolevening air just as the parachute floats down from the sky My fingers quickly undo the tie hoping for some real medicine to treat Peetas leg Instead I find a pot of hot broth Haymitch couldnt be sending me a clearer message One kiss equals one pot of broth I can almost hear his snarl Youre supposed to be in love sweetheart The boys dying Give me something I can work with And hes right If I want to keep Peeta alive Ive got to give the audience something more to care about Starcrossed lovers desperate to get home together Two hearts beating as one Romance Never having been in love this is going to be a real trick I think of my parents The way my father never failed to bring her gifts from the woods The way my mothers face would light up at the sound of his boots at the door The way she almost stopped living when he died Peeta I say trying for the special tone that my mother used only with my father Hes dozed off again but I kiss him awake which seems to startle him Then he smiles as if hed be happy to lie there gazing at me forever Hes great at this stuff I hold up the pot Peeta look what Haymitch has sent youGetting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing begging threatening and yes kissing but finally sip by sip he empties the pot I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to my own needs wolfing down a supper ofgroosling and roots while I watch the daily report in the sky No new casualties Still Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting day Hopefully the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night I automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before I realize thats over At least for a while I cant very well leave Peeta unguarded on the ground I left the scene of his last hiding place on the bank of the stream untouched how could I conceal it and were a scant fifty yards downstream I put on my glasses place my weapons in readiness and settle down to keep watch The temperature drops rapidly and soon Im chilled to the bone Eventually I give in and slide into the sleeping bag with Peeta Its toasty warm and I snuggle down gratefully until I realize its more than warm its overly hot because the bag is reflecting back his fever I check his forehead and find it burning and dry I dont know what to do Leave him in the bag and hope the excessive heat breaks thefever Take him out and hope the night air cools him off I end up just dampening a strip of bandage and placing it on his forehead It seems weak but Im afraid to do anything too drastic I spend the night halfsitting halflying next to Peeta refreshing the bandage and trying not to dwell on the fact that by teaming up with him Ive made myself far more vulnerable than when I was alone Tethered to the ground on guard with a very sick person to take care of But I knew he was injured And still I came after him Im just going to have to trust that whatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one When the sky turns rosy I notice the sheen of sweat on Peetas lip and discover the fever has broken Hes not back to normal but its come down a few degrees Last night when I was gathering vines I came upon a bush of Rues berries I strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold water Peetas struggling to get up when I reach the cave I woke up and you were gone he says I was worried about you I have to laugh as I ease him back down You were worried about me Have you taken a look at yourself lately I thought Cato and Clove might have found you They like to hunt at night he says still serious Clove Which one is that I ask The girl from District Two Shes still alive right hesays Yes theres just them and us and Thresh and Foxface I say Thats what I nicknamed the girl from Five How do you feel Better than yesterday This is an enormous improvement over the mud he says Clean clothes and medicine and a sleeping bag    And you Oh right the whole romance thing I reach out to touch his cheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips I remember my father doing this very thing to my mother and I wonder where Peeta picked it up Surely not from his father and the witch No more kisses for you until youve eaten I say We get him propped up against the wall and he obediently swallows the spoonfuls of theberry mush I feed him He refuses the groosling again though You didnt sleep Peeta says Im all right I say But the truth is Im exhausted Sleep now Ill keep watch Ill wake you if anything happens he says I hesitate Katniss you cant stay up forever Hes got a point there Ill have to sleep eventually And probably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert and we have daylight on our side All right I say But just for a few hours Then you wake me Its too warm for the sleeping bag now I smooth it out on the cave floor and lie down one hand on my loaded bow incase I have to shoot at a moments notice Peeta sits beside me leaning against the wall his bad leg stretched out before him his eyes trained on the world outside Go to sleep he says softly His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off my forehead Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far this gesture seems natural and comforting I dont want him to stop and he doesnt Hes still stroking my hair when I fall asleep Too long I sleep too long I know from the moment I open my eyes that were into the afternoon Peetas right beside me his position unchanged I sit up feeling somehow defensive but better rested than Ive been in days Peeta you were supposed to wake me after a couple of hours I say For what Nothings going on here he says Besides I like watching you sleep You dont scowl Improves your looks a lot This of course brings on a scowl that makes him grin Thats when I notice how dry his lips are I test his cheek Hot as a coal stove He claims hes been drinking but the containers still feel full to me I give him more fever pills and stand over him while he drinks first one then a second quart of water Then I tend to his minor wounds the burns the stings which are showing improvement I steel myself and unwrap the leg My heart drops into my stomach Its worse much worse Theres nomore pus in evidence but the swelling has increased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed Then I see the red streaks starting to crawl up his leg Blood poisoning Unchecked it will kill him for sure My chewedup leaves and ointment wont make a dent in it Well need strong antiinfection drugs from the Capitol I cant imagine the cost of such potent medicine If Haymitch pooled every donation from every sponsor would he have enough I doubt it Gifts go up in price the longer the Games continue What buys a full meal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve And the kind of medicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the beginning Well theres more swelling but the pus is gone I say in an unsteady voice I know what blood poisoning is Katniss says Peeta Even if my mother isnt a healer Youre just going to have to outlast the others Peeta Theyll cure it back at the Capitol when we win I say Yes thats a good plan he says But I feel this is mostly for my benefit You have to eat Keep your strength up Im going to make yousoup I say Dont light a fire he says Its not worth it Well see I say As I take the pot down to the stream Im struck by how brutally hot it is I swear theGamemakers are progressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime and sending it plummeting at night The heat of the sunbaked stones by the stream gives me an idea though Maybe I wont need to light a fire I settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream and the cave After purifying half a pot of water I place it in direct sunlight and add several eggsize hot stones to the water Im the first to admit Im not much of a cook But since soup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting its one of my better dishes I mince groosling until its practically mush and mash some of Rues roots Fortunately theyve both been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated up Already between the sunlight and the rocks the waters warm I put in the meat and roots swap in fresh rocks and go find something green to spice it up a little Before long I discover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks Perfect I chop them very fine and add them to the pot switch out the rocks again put on the lid and let the whole thing stew Ive seen very few signs of game around but I dont feel comfortable leaving Peeta alone while I hunt so I rig half a dozen snares and hope I get lucky I wonder about the other tributes how theyre managing now that their main source of food has been blown upAt least three of them Cato Clove and Foxface had been relying on it Probably not Thresh though Ive got a feeling he must share some of Rues knowledge on how to feed yourself from the earth Are they fighting each other Looking for us Maybe one of them has located us and is just waiting for the right moment to attack The idea sends me back to the cave Peetas stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the shade of the rocks Although he brightens a bit when I come in its clear he feels miserable I put cool cloths on his head but they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin Do you want anything I ask No he says Thank you Wait yes Tell me a story A story What about I say Im not much for storytelling Its kind of like singing But once in a while Prim wheedles one out of me Something happy Tell me about the happiest day you can remember says Peeta Something between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves my mouth A happy story This will require a lot more effort than the soup I rack my brains for good memories Most of them involve Gale and me out hunting and somehow I dont think these will play well with either Peeta or the audience That leaves Prim Did I ever tell you about how I got Prims goat I ask Peeta shakes his head and looks at me expectantly So I begin But carefullyBecause my words are going out all over Panem And while people have no doubt put two and two together that I hunt illegally I dont want to hurt Galeor Greasy Sae or the butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who are my customers by publicly announcing theyd breaking the law too Heres the real story of how I got the money for Prims goat Lady It was a Friday evening the day before Prims tenth birthday in late May As soon as school ended Gale and I hit the woods because I wanted to get enough to trade for a present for Prim Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hairbrush Our snares had done well enough and the woods were flush with greens but this was really no more than our average Fridaynight haul I was disappointed as we headed back even though Gale said wed be sure to do better tomorrow We were resting a moment by a stream when we saw him A young buck probably a yearling by his size His antlers were just growing in still small and coated in velvet Poised to run but unsure of us unfamiliar with humans Beautiful Less beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him one in the neck the other in the chest Gale and I had shot at the same time The buck tried to run but stumbled andGales knife slit his throat before he knew what had happened Momentarily Id felt a pang at killing something so fresh and innocent And then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all that fresh and innocent meat A deer Gale and I have only brought down three in all The first one a doe that had injured her leg somehow almost didnt count But we knew from that experience not to go dragging the carcass into the Hob It had caused chaos with people bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces themselves Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us with our deer to the butcher but not before itd been badly damaged hunks of meat taken the hide riddled with holes Although everybody paid up fairly it had lowered the value of the kill This time we waited until dark fell and slipped under a hole in the fence close to the butcher Even though we were known hunters it wouldnt have been good to go carrying a pound deer through the streets of District  in daylight like we were rubbing it in the officials faces The butcher a short chunky woman named Rooba came to the back door when we knocked You dont haggle with Rooba She gives you one price which you can take or leave but its a fair price We took her offer on the deer and she threw in a couple of venison steaks we could pick up after thebutchering Even with the money divided in two neither Gale nor I had held so much at one time in our lives We decided to keep it a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money at the end of the next day This is where I really got the money for the goat but I tell Peeta I sold an old silver locket of my mothers That cant hurt anyone Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prims birthday Gale and I went to the market on the square so that I could buy dress materials As I was running my fingers over a length of thick blue cotton cloth something caught myeye Theres an old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side of the Seam I dont know his real name everyone just calls him the Goat Man His joints are swollen and twisted in painful angles and hes got a hacking cough that proves he spent years in the mines But hes lucky Somewhere along the way he saved up enough for these goats and now has something to do in his old age besides slowly starve to death Hes filthy and impatient but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you can afford it One of the goats a white one with black patches was lying down in a cart It was easy to see why Something probably a dog had mauled hershoulder and infection had set in It was bad the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her But I thought I knew someone who could fix it Gale I whispered I want that goat for Prim Owning a nanny goat can change your life in District  The animals can live off almost anything the Meadows a perfect feeding place and they can give four quarts of milk a day To drink to make into cheese to sell Its not even against the law Shes hurt pretty bad said Gale We better take a closer look We went over and bought a cup of milk to share then stood over the goat as if idly curious Let her be said the man Just looking said Gale Well look fast She goes to the butcher soon Hardly anyone will buy her milk and then they only pay half price said the man Whats the butcher giving for her I asked The man shrugged Hang around and see I turned and saw Rooba coming across the square toward us Lucky thing you showed up said the Goat Man when she arrived Girls got her eye on your goat Not if shes spoken for I said carelessly Rooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat Shes not Look at that shoulder Bet you half the carcass will be too rotten for even sausage What said the Goat Man We had a deal We had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks Not that thing Sell her to the girl if shes stupid enough to takeher said Rooba As she marched off I caught her wink The Goat Man was mad but he still wanted that goal off his hands It took us half an hour to agree on the price Quite a crowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions It was an excellent deal if the goat lived Id been robbed if she died People took sides in the argument but I took the goat Gale offered to carry her I think he wanted to see the look on Prims face as much as I did In a moment of complete giddiness I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck Then we hurried back to my house You should have seen Prims reaction when we walked in with that goat Remember this is a girl who wept to save that awful old cat Buttercup She was so excited she started crying and laughing all at once My mother was less sure seeing the injury but the pair of them went to work on it grinding up herbs and coaxing brews down the animals throat They sound like you says Peeta I had almost forgotten hewas there Oh no Peeta They work magic That thing couldnt have died if it tried I say But then I bite my tongue realizing what that must sound like to Peeta who is dying in my incompetent hands Dont worry Im not trying he jokes Finishthe story Well thats it Only I remember that night Prim insisted on sleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire And just before they drifted off the goat licked her cheek like it was giving her a good night kiss or something I say It was already mad about her Was it still wearing the pink ribbon he asks I think so I say Why Im just trying to get a picture he says thoughtfully I can see why that day made you happy Well I knew that goat would be a little gold mine  say Yes of course I was referring to that not the lasting joy you gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the reaping says Peeta drily The goat has paid for itself Several times over I say in a superior tone Well it wouldnt dare do anything else after you saved its life says Peeta I intend to do the same thing Really What did you cost me again I ask A lot of trouble Dont worry Youll get it all back he says Youre not making sense I say I test his forehead The levers going nowhere but up Youre a little cooler though The sound of the trumpets startles me Im on my feet and at the mouth of the cave in a flash not wanting to miss a syllable Its my new best friend Claudius Templesmith and as I expected hes inviting us to a feast Well were not that hungry and I actually wave his offer away in indifference when he says Nowhold on Some of you may already be declining my invitation But this is no ordinary feast Each of you needs something desperately I do need something desperately Something to heal Peetas leg Each of you will find that something in a backpack marked with your district number at the Cornucopia at dawn Think hard about refusing to show up For some of you this will be your last chance says Claudius Theres nothing else just his words hanging in the air I jump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind No he says Youre not risking your life for me Who said I was I say So youre not going he asks Of course Im not going Give me some credit Do you think Im running straight into some freeforall against Cato and Clove and Thresh Dont be stupid I say helping him back to bed Ill let them fight it out well see whos in the sky tomorrow night and work out a plan from there Youre such a bad liar Katniss I dont know how youve survived this long He begins to mimic me I knew that goat would be a little gold mine Youre a little cooler though Of course Im not going He shakes his head Never gamble at cards Youll lose your last coin he says Anger flushes my face All right I am going and you cant stop me I can follow you At least partway I may not make it to the Cornucopia but if Im yelling yourname I bet someone can find me And thenIll be dead for sure he says You wont get a hundred yards from here on that leg I say Then Ill drag myself says Peeta You go and Im going too Hes just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to do it Come howling after me in the woods Even if a tribute doesnt find him something else might He cant defend himself Id probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go myself And who knows what the exertion will do to him What am I supposed to do Sit here and watch you die I say He must know thats not an option That the audience would hate me And frankly I would hate myself too if I didnt even try I wont die I promise If you promise not to go he says Were at something of a stalemate I know I cant argue him out of this one so I dont try I pretend reluctantly to go along Then you have to do what I say Drink your water wake me when I tell you and eat every bite of the soup no matter how disgusting it is I snap at him Agreed Is it ready he asks Wait here I say The airs gone cold even though the suns still up Im right about the Gamemakers messing with the temperature I wonder if the thingsomeone needs desperately is a good blanket The soup is still nice and warm in its iron pot And actually doesnt taste too bad Peeta eats without complaint even scraping out the pot to show his enthusiasm He rambles on about how delicious it is which should be encouraging if you dont know what fever does to people Hes like listening to Haymitch before the alcohol has soaked him into incoherence I give him another dose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely As I go down to the stream to wash up all I can think is that hes going to die if I dont get to that feast Ill keep him going for a day or two and then the infection will reach his heart or his brain or his lungs and hell be gone And Ill be here all alone Again Waiting for the others Im so lost in thought that I almost miss the parachute even though it floats right by me Then I spring after it yanking it from the water tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial Haymitch has done it Hes gotten the medicine I dont know how persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell their jewels and I can save Peeta Its such a tiny vial though It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta A ripple of doubt runs through me I uncork the vial and take a deep sniff My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent Just to be sure I place a drop on the tip of mytongue Theres no question its sleep syrup Its a common medicine in District  Cheap as medicine goes but very addictive Almost everyones had a dose at one time or another We have some in a bottle at home My mother gives it to hysterical patients to knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds or just to help someone in pain get through the night It only takes a little A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full day but what good is that Imso furious Im about to throw Haymitchs last offering into the stream when it hits me A full day Thats more than I need I mash up a handful of berries so the taste wont be as noticeable and add some mint leaves for good measure Then I head back up to the cave Ive brought you a treat I found a new patch of berries a little farther downstream Peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation He swallows then frowns slightly Theyre very sweet Yes theyre sugar berries My mother makes jam from them Havent you ever had them before I say poking the next spoonful in his mouth No he says almost puzzled But they taste familiar Sugar berries Well you cant get them in the market much they only grow wild I say Another mouthfulgoes down Just one more to go Theyre sweet as syrup he says taking the last spoonful Syrup His eyes widen as he realizes the truth I clamp my hand over his mouth and nose hard forcing him to swallow instead of spit He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up but its too late hes already losing consciousness Even as he fades away I can see in his eyes what Ive done is unforgivable I sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of sadness and satisfaction A stray berry stains his chin and I wipe it away Who cant lie Peeta I say even though he cant hear me It doesnt matter The rest of Panem canIn the remaining hours before nightfall I gather rocks and do my best to camouflage the opening of the cave Its a slow and arduous process but after a lot of sweating and shifting things around Im pretty pleased with my work The cave now appears to be part of a larger pile of rocks like so many in the vicinity I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening but its undetectable from the out sideThats good because Ill need to share that sleeping bag again tonight Also if I dont make it back from the feast Peeta will be hidden but not entirely imprisoned Although I doubt he can hang on much longer without medicine If I die at the feast District  isnt likely to have a victor I make a meal out of the smaller bonier fish that inhabit the stream down here fill every water container and purify it and clean my weapons Ive nine arrows left in all I debate leaving the knife with Peeta so hell have some protection while Im gone but theres really no point He was right about camouflage being his final defense But I still might have use for the knife Who knows what Ill encounter Here are some things Im fairly certain of That at least Cato Clove and Thresh will be on hand when the feast starts Im not sure about Foxface since direct confrontation isnt her style or her forte Shes even smaller than I am and unarmed unless shes picked up some weapons recently Shell probably be hanging somewhere nearby seeing what she can scavenge But the other three    Im going to have my hands full My ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset but I know Ill have to goright into the thick of things to get that backpack the one with the number  on it that Claudius Templesmith mentioned I watch the sky hoping for one less opponent at dawn but nobody appears tonight Tomorrow there will be faces up there Feasts always result in fatalities I crawl into the cave secure my glasses and curl up next to Peeta Luckily I had that good long sleep today I have to stay awake I dont really think anyone will attack our cave tonight but I cant risk missing the dawn So cold so bitterly cold tonight As if the Gamemakers have sent an infusion of frozen air across the arena which may be exactly what theyve done I lay next to Peeta in the bag trying to absorb every bit of his fever heat Its strange to be so physically close to someone whos so distant Peeta might as well be back in the Capitol or in District  or on the moon right now hed be no harder to reach Ive never felt lonelier since the Games began Just accept it will be a bad night I tell myself I try not to but I cant help thinking of my mother and Prim wondering if theyll sleep a wink tonight At this late stage in the Games with an important event like the feast school will probably be canceled My family can either watch on that staticfilled old clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the square towatch on the big clear screens Theyll have privacy at home but support in the square People will give them a kind word a bit of food if they can spare it I wonder if the baker has sought them out especially now that Peeta and I are a team and made good on his promise to keep my sisters belly full Spirits must be running high in District  We so rarely have anyone to root for at this point in the Games Surely people are excited about Peeta and me especially now that were together If I close my eyes I can imagine their shouts at the screens urging us on I see their faces Greasy Sac and Madge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for us And Gale I know him He wont be shouting and cheering But hell be watching every moment every twist and turn and willing me to come home I wonder if hes hoping that Peeta makes it as well Gales not my boyfriend but would he be if I opened that door He talked about us running away together Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district Or something more I wonder what he makes of all this kissing Through a crack in the rocks I watch the moon cross the sky At what I judge to be about three hours before dawn I begin final preparations Im careful to leave Peeta with water and the medical kit right beside him Nothingelse will be of much use if I dont return and even these would only prolong his life a short time After some debate I strip him of his jacket and zip it on over my own He doesnt need it Not now in the sleeping bag with his fever and during the day if Im not there to remove it hell be roasting init My hands are already stiff from cold so I take Rues spare pair of socks cut holes for my fingers and thumbs and pull them on It helps anyway I fill her small pack with some food a water bottle and bandages tuck the knife in my belt get my bow and arrows Im about to leave when I remember the importance of sustaining the starcrossed lover routine and I lean over and give Peeta a long lingering kiss I imagine the teary sighs emanating from the Capitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own Then I squeeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night My breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air Its as cold as a November night at home One where Ive slipped into the woods lantern in hand to join Gale at some prearranged place where well sit bundled together sipping herb tea from metal flasks wrapped in quilting hoping game will pass our way as the morning comes on OhGale I think If only you had my back now    I move as fast as I dare The glasses are quite remarkable but I still sorely miss having the use of my left ear I dont know what the explosion did but it damaged something deep and irreparable Never mind If I get home Ill be so stinking rich Ill be able to pay someone to do my hearing The woods always look different at night Even with the glasses everything has an unfamiliar slant to it As if the daytime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent slightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their places I dont try anything tricky like taking a new route I make my way back up the stream and follow the same path back to Rues hiding place near the lake Along the way I see no sign of another tribute not a puff of breath not a quiver of a branch Either Im the first to arrive or the others positioned themselves last night Theres still more than an hour maybe two when I wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the blood to begin to flow I chew a few mint leaves my stomach isnt up for much more Thank goodness I have Peetas jacket as well as my own If not Id be forced to move around to stay warm The sky turns a misty morning gray and still theres no sign of the other tributes Its not surprising really Everyone has distinguished themselves either bystrength or deadliness or cunning Do they suppose I wonder that I have Peeta with me I doubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded All the better if they think hes covering me when I go in for the backpack But where is it The arena has lightened enough for me to remove my glasses I can hear the morning birds singing Isnt it time For a second Im panicked that Im at the wrong location But no Im certain I remember Claudius Templesmith specifying the Cornucopia And there it is And here I am So wheres my feast Just as the first ray of sun glints off the gold Cornucopia theres a disturbance on the plain The ground before the mouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a snowy whitecloth rises into the arena On the table sit four backpacks two large black ones with the numbers  and  a mediumsize green one with the number  and a tiny orange one really I could carry it around my wrist that must be marked with a  The table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out of the Cornucopia snags the green backpack and speeds off Foxface Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and risky idea The rest of us are still poised around the plain sizing up thesituation and shes got hers Shes got us trapped too because no one wants to chase her down not while their own pack sits so vulnerable on the table Foxface must have purposefully left the other packs alone knowing that to steal one without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer That should have been my strategy By the lime Ive worked through the emotions of surprise admiration anger jealousy and frustration Im watching that reddish mane of hair disappear into the trees well out of shooting range Huh Im always dreading the others but maybe Foxface is the real opponent here Shes cost me time too because by now its clear that I must get to the table next Anyone who beats me to it will easily scoop up my pack and be gone Without hesitation I sprint for the table I can sense the emergence of danger before I see it Fortunately the first knife comes whizzing in on my right side so I can hear it and Im able to deflect it with my bow I turn drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow straight at Cloves heart She turns just enough to avoid a fatal hit but the point punctures her upper left arm Unfortunately she throws with her right but its enough to slow her down a few moments having to pull the arrow from her arm take in the severity of the wound I keep moving positioningthe next arrow automatically as only someone who has hunted for years can do Im at the table now my fingers closing over the tiny orange backpack My hand slips between the straps and I yank it up on my arm its really too small to fit on any other part of my anatomy and Im turning to fire again when the second knife catches me in the forehead It slices above my right eyebrow opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face blinding my eye filling my mouth with the sharp metallic taste of my own blood I stagger backward but still manage to send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assailant I know as it leaves my hands it will miss And then Clove slams into me knocking me flat on my back pinning my shoulders to the ground with her knees This is it I think and hope for Prims sake it will be fast But Clove means to savor the moment Even feels she has time No doubt Cato is somewhere nearby guarding her waiting for Thresh and possibly Peeta Wheres your boyfriend District Twelve Still hanging on she asks Well as long as were talking Im alive Hes out there now Hunting Cato I snarl at her Then I scream atthe top of my lungs Peeta Clove jams her fist into my windpipe veryeffectively cutting off my voice But her heads whipping from side to side and I know for a moment shes at least considering Im telling the truth Since no Peeta appears to save me she turns back to me Liar she says with a grin Hes nearly dead Cato knows where he cut him Youve probably got him strapped up in some tree while you try to keep his heart going Whats in the pretty little backpack That medicine for Lover Boy Too bad hell never get it Clove opens her jacket Its lined with an impressive array of knives She carefully selects an almost daintylooking number with a cruel curved blade I promised Cato if he let me have you Id give the audience a good show Im struggling now in an effort to unseat her but its no use Shes too heavy and her lock on me too tight Forget it District Twelve Were going to kill you Just like we did your pathetic little ally    What was her name The one who hopped around in the trees Rue Well first Rue then you and then I think well just let nature take care of Lover Boy How does that sound Clove asks Now where to start She carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with her jacket sleeve For a moment she surveys my face tilting it from side to side as if its a block of wood and shes deciding exactly what pattern to carve on it I attempt to bite her hand but shegrabs the hair on the top of my head forcing me back to the ground I think    She almost purrs I think well start with your mouth I clamp my teeth together as she teasingly traces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade I wont close my eyes The comment about Rue has filled me with fury enough fury I think to die with some dignity As my last act of defiance I will stare her down as long as I can see which will probably not be an extended period of time but I will stare her down I will not cry out I will die in my own small way undefeated Yes I dont think youll have much use for your lips anymore Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss she asks I work up a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face She flushes with rage All right then Lets get started I brace myself for the agony thats sure to follow But as I feel the tip open the first cut at my lip some great form yanks Clove from my body and then shes screaming Im too stunned at first too unable to process what has happened Has Peeta somehow come to my rescue Have the Gamemakers sent in some wild animal to add to the fun Has a hovercraft inexplicably plucked her into the air But when I push myself up on my numb arms I see its none of the above Clove is dangling a foot off the ground imprisoned in Threshs arms I let out a gaspseeing him like that towering over me holding Clove like a rag doll I remember him as big but he seems more massive more powerful than I even recall If anything he seems to have gained weight in the arena He flipsClove around and flings her onto the ground When he shouts I jump never having heard him speak above a mutter Whatd you do to that little girl You kill her Clove is scrambling backward on all fours like a frantic insect too shocked to even call for Cato No No it wasnt me You said her name I heard you You kill her Another thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features You cut her up like you were going to cut up this girl here No No I Clove sees the stone about the size of a small loaf of bread in Threshs hand and loses it Cato she screeches Cato Clove I hear Catos answer but hes too far away I can tell that much to do her any good What was he doing Trying to get Foxface or Peeta Or had he been lying in wait for Thresh and just badly misjudged his location Thresh brings the rock down hard against Cloves temple Its not bleeding but I can see the dent in her skull and I know that shes a goner Theres still life in her now though in the rapid rise and fall of herchest the low moan escaping her lips When Thresh whirls around on me the rock raised I know its no good to run And my bow is empty the last loaded arrow having gone in Cloves direction Im trapped in the glare of his strange golden brown eyes Whatd she mean About Rue being your ally I I we teamed up Blew up the supplies I tried to save her I did But he got there first District One I say Maybe if he knows I helped Rue he wont choose some slow sadistic end for me And you killed him he demands Yes I killed him And buried her in flowers I say And I sang her to sleep Tears spring in my eyes The tension the fight goes out of me at the memory And Im overwhelmed by Rue and the pain in my head and my fear of Thresh and the moaning of the dying girl a few feet away To sleep Thresh says gruffly To death I sang until she died I say Your district   They sent me bread My hand reaches up but not for an arrow that I know Ill never reach Just to wipe my nose Do it fast okay Thresh Conflicting emotions cross Threshs face He lowers the rock and points at me almost accusingly Just this one time I let you go For the little girl You and me were even then No more owed You understand I nod because I do understand About owing About hating it I understand that if Threshwins hell have to go back and face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank me and he is breaking the rules to thank me too And I understand that for the moment Thresh is not going to smash in my skull Clove Catos voice is much nearer now I can tell by the pain in it that he sees her on the ground You better run now Fire Girl says Thresh I dont need to be told twice I flip over and my feet dip into the hardpacked earth as I run away from Thresh and Clove and the sound of Catos voice Only when I reach the woods do I turn back for an instant Thresh and both large backpacks are vanishing over the edge of the plain into thearea Ive never seen Cato kneels beside Clove spear in hand begging her to stay with him In a moment he will realize its futile she cant be saved I crash into the trees repeatedly swiping away the blood thats pouring into my eye fleeing like the wild wounded creature I am After a few minutes I hear the cannon and I know that Clove has died that Cato will be on one of our trails Either Threshs or mine Im seized with terror weak from my head wound shaking I load an arrow but Cato can throw that spear almost as far as I can shoot Only one thing calms me down Threshhas Catos backpack containing the thing he needs desperately If I had to bet Cato headed out after Thresh not me Still I dont slow down when I reach the water I plunge right in boots still on and flounder downstream I pull off Rues socks that Ive been using for gloves and press them into my forehead trying to staunch the flow of blood but theyre soaked in minutes Somehow I make it back to the cave I squeeze through the rocks In the dappled light I pull the little orange backpack from my arm cut open the clasp and dump the contents on the ground One slim box containing one hypodermic needle Without hesitating I jam the needle into Peetas arm and slowly press down on the plunger My hands go to my head and then drop to my lap slick with blood The last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful greenandsilver moth landing on the curve of my wristThe sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gently pulls me toward consciousness I fight to return to sleep though wrapped in a warm cocoon ofblankets safe at home Im vaguely aware that my head aches Possibly I have the flu and this is why Im allowed to stay in bed even though I can tell Ive been asleep a long time My mothers hand strokes my cheek and I dont push it away as I would in wakefulness never wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch How much I miss her even though I still dont trust her Then theres a voice the wrong voice not my mothers and Im scared Katniss it says Katniss can you hear me My eyes open and the sense of security vanishes Im not home not with my mother Im in a dim chilly cave my bare feet freezing despite the cover the air tainted with the unmistakable smell of blood The haggard pale face of a boy slides into view and after an initial jolt of alarm I feel better Peeta Hey he says Good to see your eyes again How long have I been out I ask Not sure I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying next to me in a very scary pool of blood he says I think its stopped finally but I wouldnt sit up or anything I gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged This simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy Peeta holds a bottle to my lips and I drink thirstily Youre better I say Much better Whatever you shot into my arm did the trick he says By this morning almost all the swelling inmy leg was gone Hedoesnt seem angry about my tricking him drugging him and running off to the feast Maybe Im just too beatup and Ill hear about it later when Im stronger But for the moment hes all gentleness Did you eat I ask Im sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groosling before I realized it might have to last a while Dont worry Im back on a strict diet he says No its good You need to eat Ill go hunting soon I say Not too soon all right he says You just let me take care of you for a while I dont really seem to have much choice Peeta feeds me bites of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of water He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them in his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around my chin Your boots and socks are still damp and the weathers not helping much he says Theres a clap of thunder and I see lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks Rain drips through several holes in the ceiling but Peeta has built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging the square of plastic into the rock above me I wonder what brought on this storm I mean whos the target says PeetaCato and Thresh I say without thinking Foxface will be in her den somewhere and Clove    She cut me an then    My voice trails off I know Cloves dead I saw it in the sky last night h says Did you kill her No Thresh broke her skull with a rock I say Lucky he didnt catch you too says Peeta The memory of the feast returns fullforce and I feel sick He did But he let me go Then of course I have to tell him About things Ive kept to myself because he was too sick to ask and I wasnt ready to relive anyway Like the explosion and my ear and Rues dying and the boy from District  and the bread All of which leads to what happened with Thresh and how he was paying off a debt of sorts He let you go because he didnt want to owe you anything asks Peeta in disbelief Yes I dont expect you to understand it Youve always had enough But if youd lived in the Seam I wouldnt have to explain I say And dont try Obviously Im too dim to get it Its like the bread How I never seem to get over owing you for that I say The bread What From when we were kids he says I think we can let that go I mean you just brought me back from the dead But you didnt know me We had never even spoken Besides its the first gift thats always the hardest to pay back I wouldnt even have been here to do it if you hadnt helpedme then I say Why did you anyway Why You know why Peeta says I give my head a slight painful shake Haymitch said you would take a lot of convincing Haymitch I ask Whats he got to do with it Nothing Peeta says So Cato and Thresh huh I guess its too much to hope that theyll simultaneously destroy each other But the thought only upsets me I think we would like Thresh I think hed be our friend back in District Twelve I say Then lets hope Cato killshim so we dont have to says Peeta grimly I dont want Cato to kill Thresh at all I dont want anyone else to die But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that victors go around saying in the arena Despite my best efforts I can feel tears starting to pool in my eyes Peeta looks at me in concern What is it Are you in a lot of pain I give him another answer because it is equally true but can be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a terminal one I want to go home Peeta I say plaintively like a small child You will I promise he says and bends over to give me a kiss I want to go home now I say Tell you what You go back to sleep and dream of home And youll be there for real before you know it lie says Okay Okay I whisperWake me if you need me to keep watch Im good and rested thanks to you and Haymitch Besides who knows how long this will last he says What does he mean The storm The brief respite ii brings us The Games themselves I dont know but Im ion sad and tired to ask Its evening when Peeta wakes me again The rain has turned to a downpour sending streams of water through our ceiling where earlier there had been only drips Peeta has placed the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the plastic to deflect most of it from me I feel a bit better able to sit up without getting too dizzy and Im absolutely famished So is Peeta Its clear hes been waiting for me to wake up to eat and is eager to get started Theres not much left Two pieces of groosling a small mishmash of roots and a handful of dried fruit Should we try and ration it Peeta asks No lets just finish it The grooslings getting old anyway and the last thing we need is to get sick off spoiled food I say dividing the food into two equal piles We try and eat slowly but were both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes My stomach is in no way satisfied Tomorrows a hunting day I say I wont be much help with that Peeta says Ive never hunted before Ill kill and you cook I say And you can always gather I wish there was some sort of bread bush out theresays Peeta The bread they sent me from District Eleven was still warm I say with a sigh Here chew these I hand him a couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth Its hard to even see the projection in the sky but its clear enough to know there were no more deaths today So Cato and Thresh havent had it out yet Where did Thresh go I mean whats on the far side of the circle I ask Peeta A field As far as you can see its full of grasses as high as my shoulders I dont know maybe some of them are grain There are patches of different colors But there are no paths says Peeta I bet some of them are grain I bet Thresh knows which ones too I say Did you go in there No Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that grass It has a sinister feeling to it Every time I look at that field all I can think of are hidden things Snakes andrabid animals and quicksand Peeta says There could be anything in there I dont say so but Peetas words remind me of the warnings they give us about not going beyond the fence in District  I cant help for a moment comparing him with Gale who would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a threat Threshcertainly did Its not that Peetas soft exactly and hes proved hes not a coward But there are things you dont question too much I guess when your home always smells like baking bread whereas Gale questions everything What would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes between us as we break the law each day Would it shock him The things we say about Panem Gales tirades against the Capitol Maybe there is a bread bush in that field I say Maybe thats why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started the Games Either that or hes got very generous sponsors says Peeta I wonder what wed have to do to get Haymitch to send us some bread I raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesnt know about the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago One kiss equals one pot of broth Its not the sort of thing I can blurt out either To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping off the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play on their sympathies and that would result in no food at all Somehow believably Ive got to get things back on track Something simple to start with I reach out and take his hand Well he probably used up a lot of resources helping me knock you out I say mischievously Yeah about that says Peeta entwining his fingers in mine Dont try something likethat again Or what I ask Or    Or    He cant think of anything good Just give me a minute Whats the problem I say with a grin The problem is were both still alive Which only reinforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing says Peeta I did do the right thing I say No Just dont Katniss His grip tightens hurting my hand and theres real anger in his voice Dont die for me You wont be doing me any favors All right Im startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent opportunity for getting food so I try to keep up Maybe I did it for myself Peeta did you ever think of that Maybe you arent the only one who    Who worries about    What it would be like if   I fumble Im not as smooth with words as Peeta And while I was talking the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and I realized how much I dont want him to die And its not about the sponsors And its not about what will happen back home And its not just that I dont want to be alone Its him I do not want to lose the boy with the bread If what Katniss he says softly I wish I could pull the shutters closed blocking out this moment from the prying eyes of Panem Even if it means losing food Whatever Im feeling its no ones business but mine Thats exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer clear of Isay evasively although Haymitch never said anything of the kind In fact hes probably cursing me out right now for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged moment But Peeta somehow catches it Then Ill just have to fill in the blanks myself he says and moves in to me This is the first kiss that were both fully aware of Neither of us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious Our lips neither burning with fever or icy cold This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest Warm and curious This is the first kiss that makes me want another But I dont get it Well I do get a second kiss but its just a light one on the tip of my nose because Peetas been distracted I think your wound is bleeding again Come on lie down its bedtime anyway he says My socks are dry enough to wear now I make Peeta put his jacket back on The damp cold seems to cut right down to my bones so he must be half frozen I insist on taking the first watch too although neither of us think its likely anyone will come in this weather But he wont agree unless Im in the bag too and Im shivering so hard that its pointless to object In stark contrast to two nights ago when I felt Peeta was a million miles away Im struck by his immediacy now As we settle in he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow the other restsprotectively over me even when he goes to sleep No one has held me like this in such a long time Since my father died and I stopped trusting my mother no one elses arms have made me feel this safe With the aid of the glasses I lie watching the drips of water splatter on the cave floor Rhythmic and lulling Several times I drift off briefly and then snap awake guilty and angry with myself After three or four hours I cant help it I have to rouse Peeta because I cant keep my eyes open He doesnt seem to mind Tomorrow when its dry Ill find us a place so high in the trees we can both sleep in peace I promise as I drift off But tomorrow is no better in terms of weather The deluge continues as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all away The thunders so powerful it seems to shake the ground Peetas considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food but I tell him in this storm it would be pointless He wont be able to see three feet in front of his face and hell only end up getting soaked to the skin for his troubles He knows Im right but the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful The day drags on turning into evening and theres no break in the weather Haymitch is our only hope but nothing is forthcoming either from lack of money everything will cost an exorbitant amount or because hesdissatisfied with our performance Probably the latter Id be the first to admit were not exactly riveting today Starving weak from injuries trying not to reopen wounds Were sitting huddled together wrapped in the sleeping bag yes but mostly to keep warm The most exciting thingeither of us does is nap Im not really sure how to ramp up the romance The kiss last night was nice but working up to another will take some forethought There are girls in the Seam some of the merchant girls too who navigate these waters so easily But Ive never had much time or use for it Anyway just a kiss isnt enough anymore clearly because if it was wed have gotten food last night My instincts tell me Haymitch isnt just looking for physical affection he wants something more personal The sort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when we were practicing for the interview Im rotten at it but Peetas not Maybe the best approach is to get him talking Peeta I say lightly You said at the interview youd had a crush on me forever When did forever start Oh lets see I guess the first day of school We were five You had on a red plaid dress and your hair    It was in two braids instead of one My father pointed you out when we were waiting to line up Peeta says Your father Why I ask He said See that little girl I wanted to marry her mother but she ran off with a coal miner Peeta says What Youre making that up I exclaim No true story Peeta says And I said A coal miner Why did she want a coal miner if she couldve had you And he said Because when he sings    Even the birds stop to listen Thats true They do I mean they did I say Im stunned and surprisingly moved thinking of the baker telling this to Peeta It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing my own dismissal of music might not really be that I think its a waste of time It might be because it reminds me too much of my father So that day in music assembly the teacher asked who knew the valley song Your hand shot right up in the air She stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us And I swear every bird outside the windows fell silent Peeta says Oh please I say laughing No it happened And right when your song ended I knew just like your mother I was a goner Peeta says Then for the next eleven years I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you Without success I add Without success So in a way my name being drawn in the reaping was a real piece of luck says Peeta For a moment Im almost foolishlyhappy and then confusion sweeps over me Because were supposed to be making up this stuff playing at being in love not actually being in love But Peetas story has a ring of truth to it That part about my father and the birds And I did sing the first day of school although I dont remember the song And that red plaid dress    There was one a handmedown to Prim that got washed to rags after my fathers death It would explain another thing too Why Peeta took a beating to give me the bread on that awful hollow day So if those details are true    Could it all be true You have a    Remarkable memory I say haltingly I remember everything about you says Peeta tucking a loose strand of hairbehind my ear Youre the one who wasnt paying attention I am now I say Well I dont have much competition here he says I want to draw away to close those shutters again but I know I cant Its as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my ear Say it Say it I swallow hard and get the words out You dont have much competition anywhere And this time its me who leans in Our lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside makes us jump My bow comes up the arrow readyto fly but theres no other sound Peeta peers through the rocks and then gives a whoop Before I can stop him lies out in the rain then handing something in to me A silver parachute attached to a basket I rip it open at once and inside theres a feast fresh rolls goat cheese apples and best of all a tureen of that incredible lamb stew on wild rice The very dish I told Caesar Flickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to offer Peeta wriggles back inside his face lit up like the sun I guess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve I guess so I answer But in my head I can hear Haymitchs smug if slightly exasperated words Yes thats what Im looking lot sweetheartEvery cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and cram it handful by handful into my mouth But Peetas voice stops me We better take it slow on that stew Remember the first night on the train The rich food made me sick and I wasnt even starving then Youre right And I could just inhale the whole thing I sayregretfully But I dont We are quite sensible We each have a roll half an apple and an eggsize serving of stew and rice I make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls they even sent us silverware and plates savoring each bite When we finish I stare longingly at the dish I want more Me too Tell you what We wait an hour if it stays down then we get another serving Peeta says Agreed I say Its going to be a long hour Maybe not that long says Peeta What was that you were saying just before the food arrived Something about me    No competition    Best thing that ever happened to you    I dont remember that last part I say hoping its too dim in here for the cameras to pick up my blush Oh thats right Thats what I was thinking he says Scoot over Im freezing I make room for him in the sleeping bag We lean back against the cave wall my head on his shoulder his arms wrapped around me I can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep up the act So since we were five you never even noticed any other girls I ask him No I noticed just about every girl but none of them made a lasting impression but you he says Im sure that would thrill your parents you liking a girl from the Seam I say Hardly But I couldnt care less Anyway if we make it back you wont be a girl from the Seam youll be a girl from theVictors Village he says Thats right If we win well each get a house in the part of town reserved for Hunger Games victors Long agowhen the Games began the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each district Of course in ours only one is occupied Most of the others have never been lived in at all A disturbing thought hits me But then our only neighbor will be Haymitch Ah thatll be nice says Peeta tightening his arms around me You and me and Haymitch Very cozy Picnics birthdays long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games tales I told you he hates me I say but I cant help laughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new pal Only sometimes When hes sober Ive never heard him say one negative thing about you says Peeta Hes never sober I protest Thats right Who am I thinking of Oh I know Its Cinna who likes you But thats mainly because you didnt try to run when he set you on fire says Peeta On the other hand Haymitch    Well if I were you Id avoid Haymitch completely He hates you I thought you said I was his favorite I say He hates me more says Peeta I dont think people in general are his sort of thing I know theaudience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitchs expense He has been around so long hes practically an old friend to some of them And after his headdive off the stage at the reaping everybody knows him By this time theyll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us No telling what sort of lies hes made up Hes at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment Kind of like me when I was alone in the arena I wonder how hes holding up with the drinking the attention and the stress of trying to keep us alive Its funny Haymitch and I dont get along well in person but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it and how I knew the sleep syrup just wasnt something to ease Peetas pain and how I know now that I have to play up the romance He hasnt made much effort to connect with Peeta really Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta whereas Ill see the strings attached to it A thought hits me and Im amazed the questions taken so long to surface Maybe its because Ive only recently begun to view Haymitch witha degree of curiosity How do you think he did it Who Did what Peeta asks Haymitch How do you think he won the Games I say Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers Haymitch is sturdily built but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh Hes not particularly handsome Not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you And hes so surly its hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him Theres only one way Haymitch could have won and Peeta says it just as Im reaching this conclusion myself He outsmarted the others says Peeta I nod then let the conversation drop But secretlyIm wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive Maybe he wasnt always a drunk Maybe in the beginning he tried to help the tributes But then it got unbearable It must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die Year after year after year I realize that if I get out of here that will become my job To mentor the girl from District  The idea is so repellent I thrust it from my mind About half an hour has passed before I decide I have to eat again Peetas too hungry himself toput up an argument While Im dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew and rice we hear the anthem begin to play Peeta presses his eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky There wont be anything to see tonight I say far more interested in the stew than the sky Nothings happened or we wouldve heard a cannon Katniss Peeta says quietly What Should we split another roll too I ask Katniss he repeats but I find myself wanting to ignore him Im going to split one But Ill save the cheese for tomorrow I say I see Peeta staring at me What Thresh is dead says Peeta He cant be I say They must have fired the cannon during the thunder and we missed it says Peeta Are you sure I mean its pouring buckets out there I dont know how you can see anything I say I push him away from the rocks and squint out into the dark rainy sky For about ten seconds I catch a distorted glimpse of Threshs picture and then hes gone Just like that I slump down against the rocks momentarily forgetting about the task at hand Thresh dead I should be happy right One less tribute to face And a powerful one too But Im not happy All I can think about is Thresh letting me go letting me run because of Rue who died with that spear in her stomach    You all right asks Peeta I give a noncommittalshrug and cup my elbows in my hands hugging them close to my body I have to bury the real pain because whos going to bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents Rue was one thing We were allies She was so young But no one will understand my sorrow at Threshs murder The word pulls me up short Murder Thankfully I didnt say it aloud Thats not going to win me any points in the arena What I do say is Its just    If we didnt win    I wanted Thresh to Because he let me go And because of Rue Yeah I know says Peeta But this means were one step closer to District Twelve He nudges a plate of foot into my hands Eat Its still warm I take a bite of the stew to show I dont really care but its like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow It also means Cato will be back hunting us And hes got supplies again says Peeta Hell be wounded I bet I say What makes you say that Peeta asks Because Thresh would have never gone down without a fight Hes so strong I mean he was And they were in his territory I sayGood says Peeta The more wounded Cato is the better I wonder how Foxface is making out Oh shes fine I say peevishly Im still angry she thought of hiding inthe Cornucopia and I didnt Probably be easier to catch Cato than her Maybe theyll catch each other and we can just go home says Peeta But we better be extra careful about the watches I dozed off a few times Me too I admit But not tonight We finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to take the first watch I burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras I just need a few moments of privacy where I can let any emotion cross my face without being seen Under the hood I silently say goodbye to Thresh and thank him for my life I promise to remember him and if I can do something to help his family and Rues if I win Then I escape into sleep comforted by a full belly and the steady warmth of Peeta beside me When Peeta wakes me later the first thing I register is the smell of goat cheese Hes holding out half a roll spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices Dont be mad he says I had to eat again Heres your half Oh good I say immediately taking a huge bite The strong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim makes the apples are sweet and crunchy Mm We make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery he says Bet thats expensive I say Too expensive for my family to eat Unless its gone very stale Of coursepractically everything we eat is stale says Peeta pulling the sleeping bag up around him In less than a minute hes snoring Huh I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life And its true Peeta has always had enough to eat But theres something kind of depressing about living your life on stale bread the hard dry loaves that no one else wanted One thing about us since I bring our food home on a daily basis most of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isnt going to make a run for it Somewhere during my shift the rain stops not gradually but all at once The downpour ends and theres only the residual drippings of water from branches the rush of the now overflowing stream below us A full beautiful moon emerges and even without the glasses I can see outside I cant decide if the moon is real or merely a projection of the Gamemakers I know it was full shortly before I left home Gale and I watched it rise as we hunted into the late hours How long have I been gone Im guessing its been about two weeks in the arena and there was that week of preparation in the Capitol Maybe the moon has completed its cycle For some reason I badly want it to be my moon the same one I see from the woods around District  That would give me something to cling to in the surreal world of the arenawhere the authenticity of everything is to be doubted Four of us left For the first time I allow myself to truly think about the possibility that I might make it homeTo fame To wealth To my own house in the Victors Village My mother and Prim would live there with me No more fear of hunger A new kind of freedom But then    What What would my life be like on a daily basis Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food Take that away and Im not really sure who I am what my identity is The idea scares me some I think of Haymitch with all his money What did his life become He lives alone no wife or children most of his waking hours drunk I dont want to end up like that But you wont be alone I whisper to myself I have my mother and Prim Well for the time being And then    I dont want to think about then when Prim has grown up my mother passed away I know Ill never marry never risk bringing a child into the world Because if theres one thing being a victor doesnt guarantee its your childrens safety My kids names would go right into the reaping balls with everyone elses And I swear Ill never let that happen The sun eventually rises its light slipping through the cracks and illuminating Peetas face Who will he transform into if we make it home This perplexing goodnatured boy who can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Panem believes him to be hopelessly in love with me and Ill admit it there are moments when he makes me believe it myself At least well be friends I think Nothing will change the fact that weve saved each others lives in here And beyond that he will always be the boy with the bread Good friends Anything beyond that though    And I feel Gales gray eyes watching me watching Peeta all the way from District  Discomfort causes me to move I scoot over and shake Peetas shoulder His eyes open sleepily and when they focus on me he pulls me down for a long kiss Were wasting hunting time I say when I finally break away I wouldnt call it wasting he says giving a big stretch as he sits up So do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an edge Not us I say We stuff ourselves to give us staying power Count me in Peeta says But I can see hes surprised when I divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate to him All this Well earn it back today I say and we both plow into our plates Even cold its one of the best things Ive ever tasted I abandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my finger I can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners HeyEffie watch this says Peeta He tosses his fork over his shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue making loud satisfied sounds Then he blows a kiss out to her in general and calls We miss you Effie I cover his mouth with my hand but Im laughing Stop Cato could be right outside our cave He grabs my hand away What do I care Ive got you to protect me now says Peeta pulling me to him Come on I say in exasperation extricating myself from his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss Once were packed up and standingoutside our cave our mood shifts to serious Its as though for the last few days sheltered by the rocks and the rain and Catos preoccupation with Thresh we were given a respite a holiday of sorts Now although the day is sunny and warm we both sense were really back in the Games I hand Peeta my knife since whatever weapons he once had are long gone and he slips it into his belt My last seven arrows of the twelve I sacrificed three in the explosion two at the feast rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver I cant afford to lose any more Hell be hunting us by now says Peeta Cato isnt one to wait for his prey to wander by If hes wounded I begin It wont matterPeeta breaks in If he can move hes coming With all the rain the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side We stop there to replenish our water I check the snares I set days ago and come up empty Not surprising with the weather Besides I havent seen many animals or signs of them in this area If we want food we better head back up to my old hunting grounds I say Your call Just tell me what you need me to do Peeta says Keep an eye out I say Stay on the rocks as much as possible no sense in leaving him tracks to follow And listen for both of us Its clear at this point that the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for good Id walk in the water to cover our tracks completely but Im not sure Peetas leg could take the current Although the drugs have erased the infection hes still pretty weak My forehead hurts along the knife cut but after three days the bleeding has stopped I wear a bandage around my head though just in case physical exertion should bring it back As we head up alongside the stream we pass the place where I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud One good thing between the downpour and the flooded banks all signs of his hiding place have been wiped out That means that if need be we can come back to our cave Otherwise I wouldnt riskit with Cato after us The boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to pebbles and then to my relief were back on pine needles and the gentle incline of the forest floor For the first time I realize we have a problem Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg well youre naturally going to make some noise But even on the smooth bed of needles Peeta is loud And I mean loud loud as if hes stomping his feet or something I turn and look at him What he asks Youve got to move more quietly I say Forget about Cato youre chasing off every rabbit in a tenmile radius Really he says Sorry I didnt know So we start up again and hes a tiny bit better but even with only one working ear hes making me jump Can you take your boots off I suggest Here he asks in disbelief as if Id asked him to walk barefoot on hot coals or something I have to remind myself that hes still not used to the woods that its the scary forbidden place beyond the fences ofDistrict  I think of Gale with his velvet tread Its eerie how little sound he makes even when the leaves have fallen and its a challenge to move at all without chasing off the game I feel certain hes laughing back home Yes I say patiently I will too That way well both be quieter Like I was making any noise So we both strip off our boots and socks and while theres some improvement I could swear hes making an effort to snap every branch we encounter Needless to say although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with Rue Ive shot nothing If the stream would settle down fish might be an option but the current is still too strong As we stop to rest and drink water I try to work out a solution Ideally Id dump Peeta now with some simple rootgathering chore and go hunt but then hed be left with only a knife to defend himself against Catos spears and superior strength So what Id really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe then go hunt and come back and collect him But I have a feeling his ego isnt going to go for that suggestion Katniss he says We need to split up I know Im chasing away the game Only because your legs hurt I say generously because really you can tell thats only a small part of the problem I know he says So why dont you go on Show me some plants to gather and that way well both be useful Not if Cato comes and kills you I tried to say it in a nice way but it still sounds like I think hes a weakling Surprisingly he just laughs Look I can handle Cato I fought him before didnt I Yeah and that turnedout great You ended up dying in a mud bank Thats what I want to say but I cant He did save my life by taking on Cato after all I try another tactic What if you climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I hunted I say trying to make it sound like very important work What if you show me whats edible around here and go get us some meat he says mimicking my tone Just dont go far in case you need help I sigh and show him some roots to dig We do need food no question One apple two rolls and a blob of cheese the size of a plum wont last long Ill just go a short distance and hope Cato is a long way off I teach him a bird whistle not a melody like Rues but a simple twonote whistle which we can use to communicate that were all right Fortunately hes good at this Leaving him with the pack I head off I feel like Im eleven again tethered not to the safety of the fence but to Peeta allowing myself twenty maybe thirty yards of hunting space Away from him though the woods come alive with animal sounds Reassured by his periodic whistles I allow myself to drift farther away and soon have two rabbits and a fat squirrel to show for it I decide its enough I can set snares and maybe get some fish With Peetas roots this will be enough for now As I travel the short distance back I realize we haventexchanged signals in a while When my whistle receives noresponse I run In no time I find the pack a neat pile of roots beside it The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground where the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers it But where is he Peeta I call out in a panic Peeta I turn to the rustle of brush and almost send an arrow through him Fortunately I pull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to his left He jumps back flinging a handful of berries into the foliage My fear comes out as anger What are you doing Youre supposed to be here not running around in the woods I found some berries down by the stream he says clearly confused by my outburst I whistled Why didnt you whistle back I snap at him I didnt hear The waters too loud I guess he says He crosses and puts his hands on my shoulders Thats when I feel that Im trembling I thought Cato killed you I almost shout No Im fine Peeta wraps his arms around me but I dont respond Katniss I push away trying to sort out my feelings If two people agree on a signal they stay in range Because if one of them doesnt answer theyre in trouble all right All right he says All right Because thats what happened with Rueand I watched her die I say I turn away from him go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water although I still have some in mine But Im not ready to forgive him I notice the food The rolls and apples are untouched but someones definitely picked away part of the cheese And you ate without me I really dont care I just want something else to be mad about What No I didnt Peeta says Oh and I suppose the apples ate the cheese I say I dont know what ate the cheese Peeta says slowly and distinctly as if trying not to lose his temper but it wasnt me Ive been down by the stream collecting berries Would you care for some I would actually but I dont want to relent too soon I do walk over and look at them Ive never seen this type before No I have But not in the arena These arent Rues berries although they resemble them Nor do they match any I learned about in training I lean down and scoop up a few rolling them between my fingers My fathers voice comes back to me Not these Katniss Never these Theyre nightlock Youll be dead before they reach your stomach Just then the cannon fires I whip around expecting Peeta to collapse to the ground but he only raises his eyebrows The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away Whats left of Foxfaces emaciated body is lifted into the airI can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight I should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese    Peeta has me by the arm pushing me toward a tree Climb Hell be here in a second Well stand a better chance fighting him from above I stop him suddenly calm No Peeta shes your kill not Catos What I havent even seen her since the first day he says How could I have killed her In answer I hold out the berriesIt takes a while toexplain the situation to Peeta How Foxface stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it how she wouldnt question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves I wonder how she found us says Peeta My fault I guess if Im as loud as you say We were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle but I tryto be kind And shes very clever Peeta Well she was Until you outfoxed her Not on purpose Doesnt seem fair somehow I mean we would have both been dead too if she hadnt eaten the berries first He checks himself No of course we wouldnt You recognized them didnt you I give a nod We call them nightlock Even the name sounds deadly he says Im sorry Katniss I really thought they were the same ones youd gathered Dont apologize It just means were one step closer to home right I ask Ill get rid of the rest Peeta says He gathers up the sheet of blue plastic careful to trap the berries inside and goes to toss them into the woods Wait I cry I find the leather pouch that belonged to the boy from District  and fill it with a few handfuls of berries from the plastic If they fooled Foxface maybe they can fool Cato as well If hes chasing us or something we can act like we accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them Then hello District Twelve says Peeta Thats it I say securing the pouch to my belt Hell know where we are now says Peeta If he was anywhere nearby and saw that hovercraft hell know we killed her and come after us Peetas right This could be just the opportunity Catos been waiting for But even if we run now theres the meat to cook and our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts Lets make a fire Rightnow I begin to gather branches and brush Are you ready to face him Peeta asks Im ready to eat Better to cook our food while we have the chance If he knows were here he knows But he also knows theres two of us and probably assumes we were hunting Foxface That means youre recovered And the fire means were not hiding were inviting him here Would you show up I ask Maybe not he says Peetas a whiz with fires coaxing a blaze out of the damp wood In no time I have the rabbits and squirrel roasting the roots wrapped in leaves baking in the coals We take turns gathering greens and keeping a careful watch for Cato but as I anticipated he doesnt make an appearance When the foods cooked I pack most of it up leaving us each a rabbits leg to eat as we walk I want to move higher into the woods climb a good tree and make camp for the night but Peeta resists I cant climb like you Katniss especially with my leg and I dont think I could ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground Its not safe to stay in the open Peeta I say Cant we go back to the cave he asks Its near water and easy to defend I sigh Several more hours of walking or should I say crashing throughthe woods to reach an area well just have to leave in the morning to hunt But Peeta doesnt ask for much Hes followed my instructions all day and Im sure if things were reversed he wouldnt make me spend the night in a tree It dawns on me that I havent been very nice to Peeta today Nagging him about how loud he was screaming at him over disappearing The playful romance we had sustained in the cave has disappeared out in the open under the hot sun with the threat of Cato looming over us Haymitch has probably just about had it with me And as for the audience    I reach up and give him a kiss Sure Lets go back to the cave He looks pleased and relieved Well that was easy I work my arrow out of the oak careful not to damage the shaft These arrows are food safety and life itself now We toss a bunch more wood on the fire It should be sending off smoke for a few more hours although I doubt Cato assumes anything at this point When we reach the stream I see the water has dropped considerably and moves at its old leisurely pace so I suggest we walk back in it Peetas happy to oblige and since hes a lot quieter in water than on land its a doubly good idea Its a long walk back to the cave though even going downward even with the rabbit to give us a boost Were both exhausted by ourhike today and still way too underfed I keep my bow loaded both for Cato and any fish I might see but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures By the time we reach our destination our feet are dragging and the sun sits low on the horizon We fill up our water bottles and climb the little slope to our den Its not much but out here in the wilderness its the closest thing we have to a home It will be warmer than a tree too because it provides some shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in from the west I set a good dinner out but halfway through Peeta begins to nod off After days of inactivity the hunt has taken its toll I order him into the sleeping bag and set aside the rest of his food for when he wakes He drops off immediately I pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his forehead not for the audience but for me Because Im so grateful that hes still here not dead by the stream as Id thought So glad that I dont have to face Cato alone Brutal bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his arm who had the power to overcome Thresh who has had it out for me since the beginning He probably has had a special hatred for me ever since I outscored him in training A boy like Peeta would simply shrug that off But I have a feeling it drove Cato to distraction Which is not that hard Ithink of his ridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up The others were upset of course but he was completely unhinged I wonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane The sky lights up with the seal and I watch Foxface shine in the sky and then disappear from the world forever He hasnt said it but Idont think Peeta felt good about killing her even if it was essential I cant pretend Ill miss her but I have to admire her My guess is if they had given us some sort of test she would have been the smartest of all the tributes If in fact we had been setting a trap for her I bet shed have sensed it and avoided the berries It was Peetas own ignorance that brought her down Ive spent so much time making sure I dont underestimate my opponents that Ive forgotten its just as dangerous to overestimate them as well That brings me back to Cato But while I think I had a sense of Foxface who she was and how she operated hes a little more slippery Powerful well trained but smart I dont know Not like she was And utterly lacking in the control Foxface demonstrated I believe Cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper Not that I can feel superior on that point I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the apple in the pigs mouth when I was so enraged Maybe I do understand Cato better than I think Despite the fatigue in my body my minds alert so I let Peeta sleep long past our usual switch In fact a soft gray day has begun when I shake his shoulder He looks out almost in alarm I slept the whole night Thats not fair Katniss you should have woken me I stretch and burrow down into the bag Ill sleep now Wake me if anything interesting happens Apparently nothing does because when I open my eyes bright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks Any sign of our friend I ask Peeta shakes his head No hes keeping a disturbingly low profile How long do you think well have before the Gamemakers drive us together I ask Well Foxface died almost a day ago so theres been plenty of time for the audience to place bets and get bored I guess it could happen at any moment says Peeta Yeah I have a feeling todays the day I say I sit up and look out at the peaceful terrain I wonder how theyll do it Peeta remains silent Theres not really any good answer Well until they do no sense in wasting a hunting day But we should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we run into trouble I say Peeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal The rest of the rabbits rootsgreens the rolls spread with the last bit of cheese The only thing I leave in reserve is the squirrel and the apple By the time were done all thats left is a pile of rabbit bones My hands are greasy which only adds to my growing feeling of grubbiness Maybe we dont bathe daily in the Seam but we keep cleaner than I have of late Except for my feet which have walked in the stream Im covered in a layer of grime Leaving the cave has a sense of finality about it I dont think there will be another night in the arena somehow One way or the other dead or alive I have the feeling Ill escape it today I give the rocks a pat goodbye and we head down to the stream to wash up I can feel my skin itching for the cool water Imay do my hair and braid it back wet Im wondering if we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub when we reach the stream Or what used to be the stream Now theres only a bonedry bed I put my hand down to feel it Not even a little damp They must have drained it while we slept I say A fear of the cracked tongue aching body and fuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps into my consciousness Our bottles and skin are fairly full but with two drinking and this hot sun it wont take long to deplete them The lake says Peeta Thats where they want us to go Maybe the ponds still have some I say hopefully We can check he says but hes just humoring me Im humoring myself because I know what Ill find when we return to the pond where I soaked my leg A dusty gaping mouth of a hole But we make the trip anyway just to confirm what we already know Youre right Theyre driving us to the lake I say Where theres no cover Where theyre guaranteed a bloody fight to the death with nothing to block their view Do you want to go straightaway or wait until the waters tapped out Lets go now while weve had food and rest Lets just go end this thing he says I nod Its funny I feel almost as if its the first day of the Games again That Im in the same position Twentyone tributes are dead but I still have yet to kill Cato And really wasnt he always the one to kill Now it seems the other tributes were just minor obstacles distractions keeping us from the real battle of the Games Cato and me But no theres the boy waiting beside me I feel his arms wrap around me Two against one Should be a piece of cake he says Next time we eat it will be in the Capitol I answer You bet it will he says We stand there a while locked in an embrace feeling each other the sunlight the rustle of theleaves at our feet Then without a word we break apart and head for the lake I dont care now that Peetas footfalls send rodents scurrying make birds take wing We have to fight Cato and Id just as soon do it here as on the plain But I doubt Ill have that choice If the Gamemakers want us in the open then in the open we will be We stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where the Careers trapped me The husk of the tracker jacker nest beaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning sun confirms the location I touch it with the tip of my boot and it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the breeze I cant help looking up in the tree where Rue secretly perched waiting to save my life Tracker jackers Glimmers bloated body The terrifying hallucinations    Lets move on I say wanting to escape the darkness that surrounds this place Peeta doesnt object Given our late start to the day when we reach the plain its already early evening Theres no sign of Cato No sign of anything except the gold Cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun rays Just in case Cato decided to pull a Foxface onus we circle the Cornucopia to make sure its empty Then obediently as if following instructions we cross to the lake and fill our water containers I frown at the shrinking sun We dont want to fight him after dark Theres only the one pair of glasses Peeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the water Maybe thats what hes waiting for What do you want to do Go back to the cave Either that or find a tree But lets give him another half an hour or so Then well take cover I answer We sit by the lake in full sight Theres no point in hiding now In the trees at the edge of the plain I can see the mockingjays flitting about Bouncing melodies back and forth between them like brightly colored balls I open my mouth and sing out Rues fournote run I can feel them pause curiously at the sound of my voice listening for more I repeat the notes in the silence First one mockingjay trills the tune back then another Then the whole world comes alive with the sound Just like your father says Peeta My fingers find the pin on my shirt Thats Rues song I say I think they remember it The music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it As the notes overlap they compliment one another forming a lovely unearthly harmony It was this sound then thanks to Rue that sent the orchard workers of District  home each night Does someone start it at quitting time I wonder now that she is deadFor a while I just close my eyes and listen mesmerized by the beauty of the song Then something begins to disrupt the music Runs cut off in jagged imperfect lines Dissonant notes intersperse with the melody The mockingjays voices rise up in a shrieking cry of alarm Were on our feet Peeta wielding his knife me poised to shoot when Cato smashes through the trees and bears down on us He has no spear In fact his hands are empty yet he runs straight for us My first arrow hits his chest and inexplicably falls aside Hes got some kind of body armor I shout to Peeta Just in time too because Cato is upon us I brace myself but he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his speed I can tell from his panting the sweat pouring off his purplish face that hes been running hard a long time Not toward us From something But what My eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature leap onto the plain As Im turning away I see another half dozen join it Then I am stumbling blindly after Cato with no thought of anything but to save myselfMuttations No question about it Ive never seen these mutts but theyre no naturalborn animals They resemble huge wolves but what wolf lands and then balances easily on its hind legs What wolf waves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw as though it had a wrist These things I can see at a distance Up close Im sure their more menacing attributes will be revealed Cato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia and without question I follow him If he thinks its thesafest place who am I to argue Besides even if I could make it to the trees it would be impossible for Peeta to outrun them on that leg Peeta My hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of the Cornucopia when I remember Im part of a team Hes about fifteen yards behind me hobbling as fast as he can but the mutts are closing in on him fast I send an arrow into the pack and one goes down but there are plenty to take its place Peetas waving me up the horn Go Katniss Go Hes right I cant protect either of us on the ground I start climbing scaling the Cornucopia on my hands and feet The pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest so there are little ridges and seams to get a decent holdon But after a day in the arena sun the metal feels hot enough to blister my hands Cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn twenty feet above the ground gasping to catch his breath as he gags over the edge Nows my chance to finish him off I stop midway up the horn and load another arrow but just as Im about to let it fly I hear Peeta cry out I twist around and see hes just reached the tail and the mutts are right on his heels Climb I yell Peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg but the knife in his hand I shoot my arrow down the throat of the first mutt that places its paws on the metal As it dies the creature lashes out inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its companions Thats when I get a look at the claws Four inches and clearly razorsharp Peeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull him along Then I remember Cato waiting at the top and whip around but hes doubled over with cramps and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts than us He coughs out something unintelligible The snuffling growling sound coming from the mutts isnt helping What I shout at him He said Can they climb it answers Peeta drawing my focus back to the base of the horn The mutts are beginning to assemble As they join together they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving them an eerilyhuman quality Each has a thick coat some with fur that is straight and sleek others curly and the colors vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond Theres something else about them something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck but I cant put my finger on it They put their snouts on the horn sniffing and tasting the metal scraping paws over the surface and then making highpitched yipping sounds to one another This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room Then one of them a goodsize mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn Its back legs must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet below us its pink lips pulled back in a snarl For a moment it hangs there and in that moment I realize what else unsettled me about the mutts The greeneyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf any canine Ive ever seen They are unmistakably human And that revelation has barely registered when I notice the collar with the number  inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me The blonde hair the green eyes the number    Its Glimmer A shriek escapes my lipsand Im having trouble holding the arrow in place I have been waiting to fire only too aware of my dwindling supply of arrows Waiting to see if the creatures can in fact climb But now even though the mutt has begun to slide backward unable to find any purchase on the metal even though I can hear the slow screeching of the claws like nails on a blackboard I fire into its throat Its body twitches and flops onto the ground with a thud Katniss I can feel Peetas grip on my arm Its her I get out Who asks Peeta My head snaps from side to side as I examine the pack taking in the various sizes and colors The small one with the red coat and amber eyes    Foxface And there the ashen hair and hazel eyes of the boy from District  who died as we struggled for the backpack And worst of all the smallest mutt with dark glossy fur huge brown eyes and a collar that reads  in woven straw Teeth bared in hatred Rue    What is it Katniss Peeta shakes my shoulder Its them Its all of them The others Rue and Foxface and    All of the other tributes I choke out I hear Peetas gasp of recognition What did they do to them You dont think    Those could be their real eyes Their eyes are the least of my worries What about their brains Have they been given any of the real tributes memories  Have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly because we have survived and they were so callously murdered And the ones we actually killed    Do they believe theyre avenging their own deaths Before I can get this out the mutts begin a new assault on the horn Theyve split into two groups at the sides of the horn and are using those powerful hindquarters to launch themselves at us A pair of teeth ring together just inches from my hand and then I hear Peeta cry out feel the yank on his body the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side If not for the grip on my arm hed be on the ground but as it is it takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of the horn And more tributes are coming Kill it Peeta Kill it Im shouting and although I cant quite see whats happening I know he must have stabbed the thing because the pull lessens Im able to haul him back onto the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils awaits Cato has still not regained his feet but his breathing is slowing and I know soon hell be recovered enough to come for us to hurl us over the side to our deaths I arm my bow but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be Thresh Who else could jump so high I feel a moments relief because we must finally beup above the mutt line and Im just turning back to face Cato when Peetas jerked from my side Im sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face Cato stands before me almost at the lip of the horn holding Peeta in some kind of headlock cutting off his air Peetas clawing at Catos arm but weakly as if confused over whether its more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf I aim one of my last two arrows at Catos head knowing itll have no effect on his trunk or limbs which I can now see are clothed in a skintight fleshcolored mesh Some highgrade body armor from the Capitol Was that what was in his pack at the feast Body armor to defend against my arrows Well they neglected to send a face guard Cato just laughs Shoot me and he goes down with me Hes right If I take him out and he falls to the mutts Peeta is sure to die with him Weve reached a stalemate I cant shoot Cato without killing Peeta too He cant kill Peeta without guaranteeing an arrow in his brain We stand like statues both of us seeking an out My muscles are strained so tightly they feel they might snap at any moment My teeth clenched to the breaking point The mutts go silent and the only thing I can hear is the blood pounding in my good ear Peetas lips are turning blue IfI dont do something quickly hell die of asphyxiation and then Ill have lost him and Cato will probably use his body as a weapon against me In fact Im sure this is Catos plan because while hes stopped laughing his lips are set in a triumphant smile As if in a lastditch effort Peeta raises his fingers dripping with blood from his leg up to Catos arm Instead of trying to wrestle his way free his forefinger veers off and makes a deliberate X on the back of Catos hand Cato realizes what it means exactly one second after I do I can tell by the way the smile drops from his lips But its one second too late because by that time my arrow is piercing his hand He cries out and reflexively releases Peeta who slams back against him For a horrible moment I think theyre both going over I dive forward just catching hold of Peeta as Cato loses his footing on the bloodslick horn and pluminets to the ground We hear him hit the air leaving his body on impact and then the mutts attack him Peeta and I hold on to each other waiting for the cannon waiting for the competition to finish waiting to be released But it doesnt happen Not yet Because this is the climax of the Hunger Games and the audience expects a show I dont watch but I can hear the snarls the growls the howls of pain from both human and beast as Cato takes on the mutt packI cant understand how he can be surviving until I remember the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck and I realize what a long night this could be Cato must have a knife or sword or something too something he had hidden in his clothes because on occasion theres thedeath scream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with the golden horn The combat moves around the side of the Cornucopia and I know Cato must be attempting the one maneuver that could save his life to make his way back around to the tail of the horn and rejoin us But in the end despite his remarkable strength and skill he is simply overpowered I dont know how long it has been maybe an hour or so when Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging him dragging him back into the Cornucopia Now theyll finish him off I think But theres still no cannon Night falls and the anthem plays and theres no picture of Cato in the sky only the faint moans coming through the metal beneath us The icy air blowing across the plain reminds me that the Games are not over and may not be for who knows how long and there is still no guarantee of victory I turn myattention to Peeta and discover his leg is bleeding as badly as ever All our supplies our packs remain down by the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the mutts I have no bandage nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf Although Im shaking in the biting wind I rip off my jacket remove my shirt and zip back into the jacket as swiftly as possible That brief exposure sets my teeth chattering beyond control Peetas face is gray in the pale moonlight I make him lie down before I probe his wound Warm slippery blood runs over my fingers A bandage will not be enough Ive seen my mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate it I cut free a sleeve from my shirt wrap it twice around his leg just under his knee and tie a half knot I dont have a stick so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot twisting it as tightly as I dare Its risky business Peeta may end up losing his leg but when I weigh this against him losing his life what alternative do I have I bandage the wound in the rest of my shirt and lay down with him Dont go to sleep I tell him Im not sure if this is exactly medical protocol but Im terrified that if he drifts off hell never wake again Are you cold he asks He unzips his jacket and I press against him as he fastens it around me Its a bit warmer sharingour body heat inside my double layer of jackets but the night is young The temperature will continue to drop Even now I can feel the Cornucopia which burned so when I first climbed it slowly turning to ice Cato may win this thing yet I whisper to Peeta Dont you believe it he says pulling up my hood but hes shaking harder than I am The next hours are the worst in my life which if you think about it is saying something The cold would be torture enough but the real nightmare is listening to Cato moaning begging and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away at him After a very short time I dont care who he is or what hes done all I want is for his suffering to end Why dont they just kill him I ask PeetaYou know why he says and pulls me closer to him And I do No viewer could turn away from the show now From the Gamemakers point of view this is the final word in entertainment It goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes my mind blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow erasing everything but the present which I begin to believe will never change There will never be anything but cold and fear and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in thehorn Peeta begins to doze off now and each time he does I find myself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes and dies on me now I know Ill go completely insane Hes fighting it probably more for me than for him and its hard because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape But the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow me to follow him so I cant let him go I just cant The only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens the subtle shift of the moon So Peeta begins pointing it out to me insisting I acknowledge its progress and sometimes for just a moment I feel a flicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs me again Finally I hear him whisper that the sun is rising I open my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn I can see too how bloodless Peetas face has become How little time he has left And I know I have to get him back to the Capitol Still no cannon has fired I press my good ear against the horn and can just make out Catos voice I think hes closer now Katniss can you shoot him Peeta asks If hes near the mouth I may be able to take him out It would be an act of mercy at this point My last arrows in your tourniquet I say Make it count says Peeta unzipping his jacket letting me loose So I free the arrow tying thetourniquet back as tightly as my frozen fingers can manage I rub my hands together trying to regain circulation When I crawl to the lip of the horn and hang over the edge I feel Peetas hands grip me for support It takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light in the blood Then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy makes a sound and I know where his mouth is And I think the word hes trying to say is please Pity not vengeance sends my arrow flying into his skull Peeta pulls me back up bow in hand quiver empty Did you get him he whispers The cannon fires in answer Then we won Katniss he says hollowly Hurray for us I get out but theres no joy of victory in my voice A hole opens in the plain and as if on cue the remaining mutts bound into it disappearing as the earth closes above them We wait for the hovercraft to take Catos remains for the trumpets of victory that should follow but nothing happens Hey I shout into air Whats going on The only response is the chatter of waking birds Maybe its the body Maybe we have to move away from it says Peeta I try to remember Do you have to distance yourself from the dead tributeon the final kill My brain is too muddled to be sure but what else could be the reason for the delay Okay Think you could make it to the lake I ask Think I better try says Peeta We inch down to the tail of the horn and fall to the ground If the stiffness in my limbs is this bad how can Peeta even move I rise first swinging and bending my arms and legs until I think I can help him up Somehow we make it back to the lake I scoop up a handful of the cold water for Peeta and bring a second to my lips A mockingjay gives the long low whistle and tears of relief fill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes Catos body away Now they will take us Now we can go home But again theres no response What are they waiting for says Peeta weakly Between the loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the lake his wound has opened up again I dont know I say Whatever the holdup is I cant watch him lose any more blood I get up to find a stick but almost immediately come across the arrow that bounced off Catos body armor It will do as well as the other arrow As I stoop to pick it up Claudius Templesmiths voice booms into the arena Greetings to the final contestants of the Seventyfourth Hunger Games The earlier revision has been revoked Closer examination of the rule book has disclosed that only onewinner may be allowed he says Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor Theres a small burst of static and then nothing more I stare at Peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in They never intended to let us both live This has all been devised by the Gamemakers to guarantee the most dramatic showdown in history And like a fool I bought into it If you think about it its not that surprising he says softly I watch as he painfully makes it to his feet Then hes moving toward me as if in slow motion his hand is pulling the knife from his belt Before I am even aware of my actions my bow is loaded with the arrow pointed straight at his heart Peeta raises his eyebrows and I see the knife has already left his hand on its way to the lake where it splashes in the water I drop my weapons and take a step back my face burning in what can only be shame No he says Do it Peeta limps toward me and thrusts the weapons back in my hands I cant I say I wont Do it Before they send those mutts back or something I dont want to die like Cato he says Then you shoot me I say furiously shoving the weapons back at him You shoot me and go home and live with it And as I say it I know death right here right now would be the easier of the two You know I cant Peeta says discarding the weapons Fine Ill gofirst anyway He leans down and rips the bandage off his leg eliminating the final barrier between his blood and the earth No you cant kill yourself I say Im on my knees desperately plastering the bandage back onto his wound Katniss he says Its what I want Youre not leaving me here alone I sayBecause if he dies Ill never go home not really Ill spend the rest of my life in this arena trying to think my way out Listen he says pulling me to my feet We both know they have to have a victor It can only be one of us Please take it For me And he goes on about how he loves me what life would be without me but Ive stopped listening because his previous words are trapped in my head thrashing desperately around We both know they have to have a victor Yes they have to have a victor Without a victor the whole thing would blow up in the Gamemakers faces Theyd have failed the Capitol Might possibly even be executed slowly and painfully while the cameras broadcast it to every screen in the country If Peeta and I were both to die or they thought we were    My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt freeing it Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist No I wont let you Trust me Iwhisper He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets me go I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm Then I fill my own On the count of three Peeta leans down and kisses me once very gently The count of three he says We stand our backs pressed together our empty hands locked tight Hold them out I want everyone to see he says I spread out my fingers and the dark berries glisten in the sun I give Peetas hand one last squeeze as a signal as a goodbye and we begin counting One Maybe Im wrong Two Maybe they dont care if we both die Three Its too late to change my mind I lift my hand to my mouth taking one last look at the world The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them Stop Stop Ladies and gentlemen I am pleased to present the victors of the Seventyfourth Hunger Games Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark I give you the tributes of District TwelveI spew the berries from my mouth wiping my tongue with the end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains Peeta pulls me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water and then collapse into each others arms You didnt swallow any I ask him He shakes his head You Guess Id be dead by now if I did I say I can see his lips moving in reply but I cant hear him over the roar of the crowd in the Capitol that theyre playing live over the speakers The hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders drop only theres no way Im letting go of Peeta I keep one arm around him as I help him up and we each place a foot on the first rung of the ladder The electric current freezes us in place and this time Im glad because Im not really sure Peeta can hang on for the whole ride And since my eyes were looking down I can see that while our muscles are immobile nothing is preventing the blood from draining out of Peetas leg Sure enough the minute the door closes behind us and the current stops he slumps to the floor unconscious My fingers arestill gripping the back of his jacket so tightly that when they take him away it tears leaving me with a fistful of black fabric Doctors in sterile white masked andgloved already prepped to operate go into action Peetas so pale and still on a silver table tubes and wires springing out of him every which way and for a moment I forget were out of the Games and I see the doctors as just one more threat one more pack of mutts designed to kill him Petrified I lunge for him but Im caught and thrust back into another room and a glass door seals between us I pound on the glass screaming my head off Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol attendant who appears behind me and offers me a beverage I slump down on the floor my face against the door staring uncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand Icy cold filled with orange juice a straw with a frilly white collar How wrong it looks in my bloody filthy hand with its dirtcaked nails and scars My mouth waters at the smell but I place it carefully on the floor not trusting anything so clean and pretty Through the glass I see the doctors working feverishly on Peeta their brows creased in concentration I see the flow of liquids pumping through the tubes watch a wall of dials and lights that mean nothing to me Im not sure but I think his heart stops twice Its like being home again when they bring in the hopelessly mangled person from the mine explosion or the woman in her third day of labor or the famishedchild struggling against pneumonia and my mother and Prim they wear that same look on their faces Now is the time to run away to the woods to hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in another part of the Seam the hammers make the coffin But Im held here both by the hovercraft walls and the same force that holds the loved ones of the dying How often Ive seen them ringed around our kitchen table and I thought Why dont they leave Why do they stay to watch And now I know Its because you have no choice I startle when I catch someone staring at me from only a few inches away and then realize its my own face reflecting back in the glass Wild eyes hollow cheeks my hair in a tangled mat Rabid Feral Mad No wonder everyone is keeping a safe distance from me The next thing I know weve landed back on the roof of the Training Center and theyre taking Peeta but leaving me behind the door I start hurling myself against the glass shrieking and I think I just catch a glimpse of pink hair it must be Effie it has to be Effie coming to my rescue when the needle jabs me from behind When I wake Im afraid to move at first The entire ceiling glows with a soft yellow light allowing me to see that Im in a room containing just my bed No doors no windows are visible The air smells ofsomething sharp and antiseptic My right arm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me Im naked but the bedclothes arc soothing against my skin Itentatively lift my left hand above the cover Not only has it been scrubbed clean the nails are filed in perfect ovals the scars from the burns are less prominent I touch my cheek my lips the puckered scar above my eyebrow and am just running my fingers through my silken hair when I freeze Apprehensively I ruffle the hair by my left ear No it wasnt an illusion I can hear again I try and sit up but some sort of wide restraining band around my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inches The physical confinement makes me panic and Im trying to pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when a portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded Avox girl carrying a tray The sight of her calms me and I stop trying to escape I want to ask her a million questions but Im afraid any familiarity would cause her harm Obviously I am being closely monitored She sets the tray across my thighs and presses something that raises me to a sitting position While she adjusts my pillows I risk one question I say it out loud as clearly as my rusty voicewill allow so nothing will seem secretive Did Peeta make it She gives me a nod and as she slips a spoon into my hand I feel the pressure of friendship I guess she did not wish me dead after all And Peeta has made it Of course he did With all their expensive equipment here Still I hadnt been sure until now As the Avox leaves the door closes noiselessly after her and I turn hungrily to the tray A bowl of clear broth a small serving of applesauce and a glass of water This is it I think grouchily Shouldnt my homecoming dinner be a little more spectacular But I find its an effort to finish the spare meal before me My stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a chestnut and I have to wonder how long Ive been out because I had no trouble eating a fairly sizable breakfast that last morning in the arena Theres usually a lag of a few days between the end of the competition and the presentation of the victor so that they can put the starving wounded mess of a person back together again Somewhere Cinna and Portia will be creating our wardrobes for the public appearances Haymitch and Effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors reviewing the questions for our final interviews Back home District  is probably in chaos as they try and organize the homecoming celebrations for Peeta and me giventhat the last one was close to thirty years ago Home Prim and my mother Gale Even the thought of Prims scruffy old cat makes me smile Soon I will be home I want to get out of this bed To see Peeta and Cinna to find out more about whats been going on And why shouldnt I I feel fine But as I start to work my way out of the band I feel a cold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes and almost immediately lose consciousness This happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of time My waking eating and even though I resist the impulseto try and escape the bed being knocked out again I seem to be in a strange continual twilight Only a few things register The redheaded Avox girl has not returned since the feeding my scars are disappearing and do I imagine it Or do I hear a mans voice yelling Not in the Capitol accent but in the rougher cadences of home And I cant help having a vague comforting feeling that someone is looking out for me Then finally the time arrives when I come to and theres nothing plugged into my right arm The restraint around my middle has been removed and I am free to move about I start to sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands The skinsperfection smooth and glowing Not only are the scars from the arena gone but those accumulated over years of hunting have vanished without a trace My forehead feels like satin and when I try to find the burn on my calf theres nothing I slip my legs out of bed nervous about how they will bear my weight and find them strong and steady Lying at the foot of the bed is an outfit that makes me flinch Its what all of us tributes wore in the arena I stare at it as if it had teeth until I remember that of course this is what I will wear to greet my team Im dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in front of the wall where I know theres a door even if I cant see it when suddenly it slides open I step into a wide deserted hall that appears to have no other doors on it But it must And behind one of them must be Peeta Now that Im conscious and moving Im growing more and more anxious about him He must be all right or the Avox girl wouldnt have said so But I need to see him for myself Peeta I call out since theres no one to ask I hear my name in response but its not his voice Its a voice that provokes first irritation and then eagerness Effie I turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end of the hall Effie Haymitch and Cinna My feet take off without hesitation Maybe a victor should show more restraint moresuperiority especially when she knows this will be on tape but I dont care I run for them and surprise even myself when I launch into Haymitchs arms first When he whispers in my ear Nice job sweetheart it doesnt sound sarcastic Effies somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking about how she told everyone we were pearls Cinna just hugs me tight and doesnt say anything Then I notice Portia is absent and get a bad feeling Wheres Portia Is she with Peeta He is all right isnt he I mean hes alive I blurt out Hes fine Only they want to do your reunion live on air at the ceremony says Haymitch Oh Thats all I say The awful moment of thinking Peetas dead again passes I guess Id want to see that myself Go on with Cinna He has to get you ready says Haymitch Its a relief to be alone with Cinna to feel his protective arm around my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras down a few passages and to an elevator that leads to thelobby of the Training Center The hospital then is far underground even beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying knots and throwing spears The windows of the lobby are darkened and a handful of guards stand on duty No oneelse is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator Our footsteps echo in the emptiness And when we ride up to the twelfth floor the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash across my mind and theres a heavy tight place in my chest When the elevator doors open Venia Flavius and Octavia engulf me talking so quickly and ecstatically I cant make out their words The sentiment is clear though They are truly thrilled to see me and Im happy to see them too although not like I was to see Cinna Its more in the way one might be glad to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly difficult day They sweep me into the dining room and I get a real meal roast beef and peas and soft rolls although my portions are still being strictly controlled Because when I ask for seconds Im refused No no no They dont want it all coming back up on the stage says Octavia but she secretly slips me an extra roll under the table to let me know shes on my side We go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a while as the prep team gets me ready Oh they did a full body polish on you says Flavius enviously Not a flaw left on your skin But when I look at my naked body in the mirror all I can see is how skinny I am I mean Im sure I was worse when I came out of the arena but I can easily count my ribs They takecare of the shower settings for me and they go to work on my hair nails and makeup when Im done They chatter so continuously that I barely have to reply which is good since I dont feel very talkative Its funny because even though theyre rattling on about the Games its all about where they were or what they were doing or how they felt when a specific event occurred I was still in bed I had just had my eyebrows dyed I swear I nearly fainted Everything is about them not the dying boys and girls in the arena We dont wallow around in the Games this way in District  We grit our teeth and watch because we must and try to get back to business as soon as possible when theyre over To keep from hating the prep team I effectively tune out most of what theyre saying Cinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yellow dress across his arms Have you given up the whole girl on fire thing I ask You tell me he says and slips it over my head I immediately notice the padding over my breasts adding curves that hunger has stolen from my body My hands go to my chest and I frown I know says Cinna before I can object But the Gamemakers wanted to alter you surgically Haymitch had a huge fight with them over it This was the compromise He stops me before I can look at my reflectionWait dont forget the shoes Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and Iturn to the mirror I am still the girl on fire The sheer fabric softly glows Even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my body By comparison the chariot costume seems garish the interview dress too contrived In this dress I give the illusion of wearing candlelight What do you think asks Cinna I think its the best yet I say When I manage to pull my eyes away from the flickering fabric Im in for something of a shock My hairs loose held back by a simple hairband The makeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face A clear polish coats my nails The sleeveless dress is gathered at my ribs not my waist largely eliminating any help the padding would have given my figure The hem falls just to my knees Without heels you can see my true stature I look very simply like a girl A young one Fourteen at the most Innocent Harmless Yes it is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off when you remember Ive just won the Games This is a very calculated look Nothing Cinna designs is arbitrary I bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation I thought itd be something more    Sophisticatedlooking I say I thought Peeta would like thisbetter he answers carefully Peeta No its not about Peeta Its about the Capitol and the Gamemakers and the audience Although I do not yet understand Cinnas design its a reminder the Games are not quite finished And beneath his benign reply I sense a warning Of something he cant even mention in front of his own team We take the elevator to the level where we trained Its customary for the victor and his or her support team to rise from beneath the stage First the prep team followed by the escort the stylist the mentor and finally the victor Only this year with two victors who share both an escort and a mentor the whole thing has had to be rethought I find myself in a poorly lit area under the stage A brandnew metal plate has been installed to transport me upward You can still see small piles of sawdust smell fresh paint Cinna and the prep team peel off to change into their own costumes and take their positions leaving me alone In the gloom I see a makeshift wall about ten yards away and assume Peetas behind it The rumbling of the crowd is loud so I dont notice Haymitch until he touches my shoulder I spring away startled still half in the arena I guess Easy just me Lets have a look at you Haymitch says I hold out my arms and turn once Good enough Its not much of acompliment But what I say Haymitchs eyes shift around my musty holding space and he seems to make a decision But nothing How about a hug for luck Okay thats an odd request from Haymitch but after all we are victors Maybe a hug for luck is in order Only when I put my arms around his neck I find myself trapped in his embrace He begins talking very fast very quietly in my ear my hair concealing his lips Listen up Youre in trouble Word is the Capitols furious aboutyou showing them up in the arena The one thing they cant stand is being laughed at and theyre the joke of Panem says Haymitch I feel dread coursing through me now but I laugh as though Haymitch is saying something completely delightful because nothing is covering my mouth So what Your only defense can be you were so madly in love you werent responsible for your actions Haymitch pulls back and adjusts my hairband Got it sweetheart He could be talking about anything now Got it I say Did you tell Peeta this Dont have to says Haymitch Hes already there But you think Im not I say taking the opportunity to straighten a bright red bow tie Cinna must have wrestled him into Since when does it matter what I thinksays Haymitch Better take our places He leads me to the metal circle This is your night sweetheart Enjoy it He kisses me on the forehead and disappears into the gloom I tug on my skirt willing it to be longer wanting it to cover the knocking in my knees Then I realize its pointless My whole bodys shaking like a leaf Hopefully it will be put down to excitement After all its my night The damp moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to choke me A cold clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and I cant rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head are about to collapse to bury me alive under the rubble When I left the arena when the trumpets played I was supposed to be safe From then on For the rest of my life But if what Haymitch says is true and hes got no reason to lie Ive never been in such a dangerous place in my life Its so much worse than being hunted in the arena There I could only die End of story But out here Prim my mother Gale the people of District  everyone I care about back home could be punished if I cant pull off the girldrivencrazybylove scenario Haymitch has suggested So I still have a chance though Funny in the arena when I poured out those berries I was only thinking of outsmarting the Gamemakers not how my actions would reflect on the Capitol Butthe Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not supposed to be able to defeat it So now the Capitol will act as if theyve been in control the whole time As if they orchestrated the whole event right down to the double suicide But that will only work if I play along with them And Peeta    Peeta will suffer too if this goes wrong But what was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had told Peeta the situation That he had to pretend to be desperately in love Dont have to Hes already there Already thinking ahead of me in the Games again and well aware of the danger were in Or    Already desperately in love I dont know I havent even begun to separate out my feelings about Peeta Its too complicated What I did as part of the Games As opposed to what I did out of anger at the Capitol Or because of how it would be viewed back in District  Or simply because it was the only decent thing to doOr what I did because I cared about him These are questions to be unraveled back home in the peace and quiet of the woods when no one is watching Not here with every eye upon me But I wont have that luxury for who knows how long And right now the most dangerous part of the Hunger Games is about to beginThe anthem booms in my ears and then I hear Caesar Flickerman greeting the audience Does he know how crucial it is to get every word right from now on He must He will want to help us The crowd breaks into applause as the prep teams are presented I imagine Flavius Venia and Octavia bouncing around and taking ridiculous bobbing bows Its a safe bet theyre clueless Then Effies introduced How long shes waited for this moment I hope shes able to enjoy it because as misguided as Effie can be she has a very keen instinct about certain things and must at least suspect were in trouble Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers of course theyve been brilliant had a dazzling debut I now understand Cinnas choice of dress for me for tonight Ill need to look as girlish and innocent as possible Haymitchs appearance brings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes Well hes accomplished a first Keeping not only one but two tributes alive What if he hadnt warned me in time Would I have acted differently Flaunted the moment with the berries in the Capitols face No I dont think so But I could easily have been a lot less convincingthan I need to be now Right now Because I can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage Blinding lights The deafening roar rattles the metal under my feet Then theres Peeta just a few yards away He looks so clean and healthy and beautiful I can hardly recognize him But his smile is the same whether in mud or in the Capitol and when I see it I take about three steps and fling myself into his arms He staggers back almost losing his balance and thats when I realize the slim metal contraption in his hand is some kind of cane He rights himself and we just cling to each other while the audience goes insane Hes kissing me and all the time Im thinking Do you know Do you know how much danger were in After about ten minutes of this Caesar Flickerman taps on his shoulder to continue the show and Peeta just pushes him aside without even glancing at him The audience goes berserk Whether he knows or not Peeta is as usual playing the crowd exactly right Finally Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a goodnatured shove toward the victors chair Usually this is a single ornate chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the highlights of the Games but since there are two of us the Gamemakers have provided a plush red velvet couch A small one my mother would call it a love seat I think I sit so closeto Peeta that Im practically on his lap but one look from Haymitch tells me it isnt enough Kicking off my sandals I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head againstPeetas shoulder His arm goes around me automatically and I feel like Im back in the cave curled up against him trying to keep warm His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress but Portias put him in long black pants No sandals either but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage I wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress But I guess that was the point Caesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes and then its time for the show This will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of Panem As the lights dim and the seal appears on the screen I realize Im unprepared for this I do not want to watch my twentytwo fellow tributes die I saw enough of them die the first time My heart starts pounding and I have a strong impulse to run How have the other victors faced this alone During the highlights they periodically show the winners reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen I think back to earlier years    Some are triumphant pumping their fists in the air beating theirchests Most just seem stunned All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this love seat is Peeta his arm around my shoulder his other hand claimed by both of mine Of course the previous victors didnt have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them Condensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat especially when you consider how many cameras were going at once Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose what sort of story to tell This year for the first time they tell a love story I know Peeta and I won but a disproportionate amount of time is spent on us right from the beginning Im glad though because it supports the whole crazyinlove thing thats my defense for defying the Capitol plus it means we wont have as much time to linger over the deaths The first half hour or so focuses on the prearena events the reaping the chariot ride through the Capitol our training scores and our interviews Theres this sort of upbeat soundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful because of course almost everyone onscreen is dead Once were in the arena theres detailed coverage of the bloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate between shots of tributes dying and shots of us Mostly Peeta really theres no question hes carrying this romance thing on his shouldersNow I see what the audience saw how he misled the Careers about me stayed awake the entire night under the tracker jacker tree fought Cato to let me escape and even while he lay in that mud bank whispered my name in his sleep I seem heartless in comparison dodging fireballs dropping nests and blowing up supplies until I go hunting for Rue They play her death in full the spearing my failed rescue attempt my arrow through the boy from District s throat Rue drawing her last breath in my arms And the song I get to sing every note of the songSomething inside me shuts down and Im too numb to feel anything Its like watching complete strangers in another Hunger Games But I do notice they omit the part where I covered her in flowers Right Because even that smacks of rebellion Things pick up for me once theyve announced two tributes from the same district can live and I shout out Peetas name and then clap my hands over my mouth If Ive seemed indifferent to him earlier I make up for it now by finding him nursing him back to health going to the feast for the medicine and being very free with my kisses Objectively I can see the mutts and Catos death are as gruesome as ever but again Ifeel it happens to people I have never met And then comes the moment with the berries I can hear the audience hushing one another not wanting to miss anything A wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me when they end not with the announcement of our victory but with me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft screaming Peetas name as they try to revive him In terms of survival its my best moment all night The anthems playing yet again and we rise as President Snow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying a cushion that holds the crown Theres just one crown though and you can hear the crowds confusion whose head will he place it on until President Snow gives it a twist and it separates into two halves He places the first around Peetas brow with a smile Hes still smiling when he settles the second on my head but his eyes just inches from mine are as unforgiving as a snakes Thats when I know that even though both of us would have eaten the berries I am to blame for having the idea Im the instigator Im the one to be punished Much bowing and cheering follows My arm is about to fall off from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally bids the audience good night reminding them to tune in tomorrow for the final interviews As if they have a choice Peeta and I are whiskedto the presidents mansion for the Victory Banquet where we have very little time to eat as Capitol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one another out of the way as they try to get their picture with us Face after beaming face flashes by becoming increasingly intoxicated as the evening wears on Occasionally I catch a glimpse of Haymitch which is reassuring or President Snow which is terrifying but I keep laughing and thanking people and smiling as my picture is taken The one thing I never do is let go of Peetas hand The sun is just peeking over the horizon when we straggle back to the twelfth floor of the Training Center I think now Ill finally get a word alone with Peeta but Haymitch sends him off with Portia to get something fitted for the interview and personally escorts me to my door Why cant I talk to him I ask Plenty of time for talk when we get home says Haymitch Go to bed youre on air at two Despite Haymitchs running interference Imdetermined to see Peeta privately After I toss and turn for a few hours I slip into the hall My first thought is to check the roof but its empty Even the city streets far below are deserted after the celebration last night I go back to bed for a while andthen decide to go directly to his room but when I try to turn the knob I find my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside I suspect Haymitch initially but then theres a more insidious fear that the Capitol may by monitoring and confining me Ive been unable to escape since the Hunger Games began but this feels different much more personal This feels like Ive been imprisoned for a crime and Im awaiting sentencing I quickly get back in bed and pretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes to alert me to the start of another big big big day I have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and stew before the prep team descends All I have to say is The crowd loved you and its unnecessary to speak for the next couple of hours When Cinna comes in he shoos them out and dresses me in a white gauzy dress and pink shoes Then he personally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate a soft rosy glow We make idle chitchat but Im afraid to ask him anything of real importance because after the incident with the door I cant shake the feeling that Im being watched constantly The interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting room A space has been cleared and the love seat has been moved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses There are only a handful of cameras to record theevent No live audience at least Caesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when I Come in Congratulations Katniss How are you faring Fine Nervous about the interview I say Dont be Were going to have a fabulous time he says giving my cheek a reassuring pat Im not good at talking about myself I say Nothing you say will be wrong he says And I think Oh Caesar if only that were true But actually President Snow may be arranging some sort of accident for me as we speak Then Peetas there looking handsome in red and white pulling me off to the side I hardly get to see you Haymitch seems bent on keeping us apart Haymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive but there are too many ears listening so I just say Yes hes gotten very responsible lately Well theres just this and we go home Then he cant watch us all the time says Peeta I feel a sort of shiver run through me and theres no time to analyze why because theyre ready for us We sit somewhat formally on the love seat but Caesar says Oh go ahead and curl up next to him if you want It looked very sweet So I tuck my feet up and Peeta pulls me in close to him Someone counts backward and just like that were being broadcast live to the entire country Caesar Flickerman is wonderful teasing joking getting choked up when the occasionpresents itself He and Peeta already have the rapport they establishedthat night of the first interview that easy banter so I just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possible I mean I have to talk some but as soon as I can I redirect the conversation back to Peeta Eventually though Caesar begins to pose questions that insist on fuller answers Well Peeta we know from our days in the cave that it was love at first sight for you from what age five Caesar says From the moment I laid eyes on her says Peeta But Katniss what a ride for you I think the real excitement for the audience was watching you fall for him When did you realize you were in love with him asks Caesar Oh thats a hard one    I give a faint breathy laugh and look down at my hands Help Well I know when it hit me The night when you shouted out his name from that tree says Caesar Thank you Caesar I think and then go with his idea Yes I guess that was it I mean until that point I just tried not to think about what my feelings might be honestly because it was so confusing and it only made things worse if I actually cared about him But then in the tree everything changed I say Why do you think that was urges Caesar Maybe   Because for the first time    There was a chance I could keep him I say Behind a cameraman I see Haymitch give a sort of huff with relief and I know Ive said the right thing Caesar pulls out a handkerchief and has to take a moment because hes so moved I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and he asks So now that youve got me what are you going to do with me I turn in to him Put you somewhere you cant get hurt And when he kisses me people in the room actually sigh For Caesar this is a natural place to segue into all the ways we did get hurt in the arena from burns to stings to wounds But its not until we get around to the mutts that I forget Im on camera When Caesar asks Peeta how his new leg is working out New leg I say and I cant help reaching out and pulling up the bottom of Peetas pants Oh no I whisper taking in the metalandplastic device that has replaced his flesh No one told you asks Caesar gently I shake my head I havent had the chance says Peeta with a slight shrug Its my fault I say Because I used that tourniquet Yes its your fault Im alive says Peeta Hes right says Caesar Hed have bled to death for sure without it I guess this is true but I cant help feeling upset about it to the extent that Im afraid I might cry and then I remember everyone in the country is watchingme so I just bury my face in Peetas shirt It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me back out because its better in the shirt where no one can see me and when I do come out Caesar backs off questioning me so I can recover In fact he pretty much leaves me alone until the berries come up Katniss I know youve had a shock but Ive got to ask The moment when you pulled out those berries What was going on in your mind    Hm he says I takea long pause before I answer trying to collect my thoughts This is the crucial moment where I either challenged the Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that I cant be held responsible for my actions It seems to call for a big dramatic speech but all I get out is one almost inaudible sentence I dont know I just    Couldnt bear the thought of    Being without him Peeta Anything to add asks Caesar No I think that goes for both of us he says Caesar signs off and its over Everyones laughing and crying and hugging but Im still not sure until I reach Haymitch Okay I whisper Perfect he answers I go back to my room to collect a few things and find theres nothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge gave meSomeone returned it to my room after the Games They drive us through the streets in a car with blackened windows and the trains waiting for us We barely have time to say goodbye to Cinna and Portia although well see them in a few months when we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies Its the Capitols way of reminding people that the Hunger Games never really go away Well be given a lot of useless plaques and everyone will have to pretend they love us The train begins moving and were plunged into night until we clear the tunnel and I take my first free breath since the reaping Effie is accompanying us back and Haymitch too of course We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in front of the television to watch a replay of the interview With the Capitol growing farther away every second I begin to think of home Of Prim and my mother Of Gale I excuse myself to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants As I slowly thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and put my hair in its braid I begin transforming back into myself Katniss Everdeen A girl who lives in the Seam Hunts in the woods Trades in the Hob I stare in the mirror as I try to remember who I am and who I am not By the time I join the others the pressure of Peetas arm around my shoulders feels alienWhen the train makes a brief stop for fuel were allowed to go outside for some fresh air Theres no longer any need to guard us Peeta and I walk down along the track hand in hand and I cant find anything to say now that were alone He stops to gather a bunch of wildflowers for me When he presents them I work hard to look pleased Because he cant know that the pinkandwhite flowers are the tops of wild onions and only remind me of the hours Ive spent gathering them with Gale Gale The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours makes my stomach churn But why I cant quite frame it in my mind I only know that I feel like Ive been lying to someone who trusts me Or more accurately to two people Ive been getting away with it up to this point because of the Games But there will be no Games to hide behind back home Whats wrong Peeta asks Nothing I answer We continue walking past the end ofthe train out where even Im fairly sure there are no cameras hidden in the scrubby bushes along the track Still no words come Haymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my back Even now in the middle of nowhere he keeps his voice down Great job you two Just keep it up in the district until the cameras are goneWe should be okay I watch him head back to the train avoiding Peetas eyes Whats he mean Peeta asks me Its the Capitol They didnt like our stunt with the berries I blurt out What What are you talking about he says It seemed too rebellious So Haymitch has been coaching me through the last few days So I didnt make it worse I say Coaching you But not me says Peeta He knew you were smart enough to get it right I say I didnt know there was anything to get right says Peeta So what youre saying is these last few days and then I guess    Back in the arena    That was just some strategy you two worked out No I mean I couldnt even talk to him in the arena could I I stammer But you knew what he wanted you to do didnt you says Peeta I bite my lip Katniss He drops my hand and I take a step as if to catch my balance It was all for the Games Peeta says How you acted Not all of it I say tightly holding onto my flowers Then how much No forget that I guess the real question is whats going to be left when we get home he says I dont know The closer we get to District Twelve the more confused I get I say He waits for further explanation but nones forthcoming Well let me know when you work it out he says and the pain in his voice is palpable I know my ears are healed because even with the rumble of the engine I can hear every step he takes back to the train By the time Ive climbed aboard Peeta has disappiared into his room for the night I dont see him the next morning either In fact the next time he turns up were pulling into District  He gives me a nod his face expressionless I want to tell him that hes not being fair That we were strangers That I did what it took to stay alive to keep us both alive in the arena That I cant explain how things are with Gale because I dont know myself That its no good loving me because Im never going to get married anyway and hed just end up hating me later instead of sooner That if I do have feelings for him it doesnt matter because Ill never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family to children And how can he How can he after what weve just been through I also want to tell him how much I already miss him But that wouldnt be fair on my part So we just stand there silently watching our grimy little station rise up around us Through the window I can see the platforms thick with cameras Everyone will be eagerly watching our homecoming Out of the corner of my eye I see Peeta extend his hand I look at him unsure One more time For the audience he says His voice isnt angry Its hollow which is worseAlready the boy with the bread is slipping away from me I take his hand holding on tightly preparing for the cameras and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let goEND OF BOOK ONECatching firePART I THE SPARKI clasp the flask between my hands even though the warmth from the tea has long since leached into the frozen air My muscles are clenched tight against the cold If a pack of wild dogs were to appear at this moment the odds of scaling a tree before they attacked are not in my favor I should get up move around and work the stiffness from my limbs But instead I sit as motionless as the rock beneath me while the dawn begins to lighten the woods I cant fight the sun I can only watch helplessly as it drags me into a day that Ive been dreading for months By noon they will all be at my new house in the Victors Village The reporters the camera crews even Effie Trinket my old escort will havemade their way to District  from the Capitol I wonder if Effie will still be wearing that silly pink wig or if shell be sporting some other unnatural color especially for the Victory Tour There will be others waiting too A staff to cater to my every need on the long train trip A prep team to beautify me for public appearances My stylist and friend Cinna who designed the gorgeous outfits that first made the audience take notice of me in the Hunger Games If it were up to me I would try to forget the Hunger Games entirely Never speak of them Pretend they were nothing but a bad dream But the Victory Tour makes that impossible Strategically placed almost midway between the annual Games it is the Capitols way of keeping the horror fresh and immediate Not only are we in the districts forced to remember the iron grip of the Capitols power each year we are forced to celebrate it And this year I am one of the starsof the show I will have to travel from district to district to stand before the cheering crowds who secretly loathe me to look down into the faces of the families whose children I have killed The sun persists in rising so I make myself stand All my joints complain and my left leg has been asleep for so long that it takes several minutes of pacing to bring the feeling back into it Ive been in the woods three hours but as Ive made no real attempt at hunting I have nothing to show for it It doesnt matter for my mother and little sister Prim anymore They can afford to buy butcher meat in town although none of us likes it any better than fresh game But my best friend Gale Hawthorne and his family will be depending on todays haul and I cant let them down I start the hourandahalf trek it will take to cover our snare line Back when we were in school we had time in the afternoons to check the line and hunt and gather and stillget back to trade in town But now that Gale has gone to work in the coal mines  and I have nothing to do all dayIve taken over the job By this time Gale will have clocked in at themines taken the stomachchurning elevator ride into the depths of the earth and be pounding away at a coal seam I know what its like down there Every year in school as part of our training my class had to tour the mines When I was little it was just unpleasant The claustrophobic tunnels foul air suffocating darkness on all sides But after my father and several other miners were killed in an explosion I could barely force myself onto the elevator The annual trip became an enormous source of anxiety Twice I made myself so sick in anticipation of it that my mother kept me home because she thought I had contracted the flu Ithink of Gale who is only really alive in the woods with its fresh air and sunlight and clean flowing water I dont know how he stands it Well  yes I do He stands it because its the way to feed his mother and two younger brothers and sister And here I am with buckets of money far more than enough to feed both our families now and he wont take a single coin Its even hard for him to let me bring in meat although hed surely have kept my mother and Prim supplied if Id been killed in the Games I tell him hes doing me a favor that it drives me nuts to sit around all day Even so I never drop off the game while hes at home Which is easy since he works twelve hours a day The only time I really get to see Gale now is on Sundays when we meet up in the woods to hunt together Its still the best day of the week but its not like it used to be before when we could tell each other anything The Games have spoiled even that I keephoping that as time passes well regain the ease between us but part of me knows its futile Theres no going back I get a good haul from the traps  eight rabbits two squirrels and a beaver that swam into a wire contraption Gale designed himself Hes something of a whiz with snares rigging them to bent saplings so they pull the kill out of the reach of predators balancing logs on delicate stick triggers weaving inescapable baskets to capture fish As I go along carefully resetting each snare I know I can never quite replicate his eye for balance his instinct for where the prey will cross the path Its more than experience Its a natural gift Like the way I can shoot at an animal in almost complete darkness and still take it down with one arrow By the time I make it back to the fence that surrounds District  the sun is well up As always I listen a moment but theres no telltale hum of electrical current running through the chainlink There hardly ever is even though the thing is supposed to be charged fulltime I wriggle through the opening at the bottom of the fence and come up in the Meadow just a stones throw from my home My old home We still get to keep it since officially its the designated dwelling of my mother and sister If I should drop dead right now they would have to return to it But at present theyre bothhappily installed in the new house in the Victors Village and Im the only one who uses the squat little place where I was raised To me its my real home I go there now to switch my clothes Exchange my fathers old leather jacket for a fine wool coat that always seems too tight in the shoulders Leave my soft worn hunting boots for a pair of expensive machinemade shoes that my mother thinks are more appropriate for someone of my status Ive alreadystowed my bow and arrows in a hollow log in the woods Although time is ticking away I allow myself a few minutes to sit in the kitchen It has an abandoned quality with no fire on the hearth no cloth on the table I mourn my old life here We barely scraped by but I knew where I fit in I knew what my place was in the tightly interwoven fabric that was our life I wish I could go back to it because in retrospect it seems so secure compared with now when I am so rich and so famous and so hated by the authorities in the Capitol A wailing at the back door demands my attention I open it to find Buttercup Prims scruffy old tomcat He dislikes the new house almost as much as I do and always leaves it when my sisters at school Weve never been particularly fond of each other but now we have this new bond I let him in feed him a chunk of beaver fat and even rub him between the ears for a bit Youre hideous youknow that right I ask him Buttercup nudges my hand for more petting but we have to go Come on you I scoop him up with one hand grab my game bag with the other and haul them both out onto the street The cat springs free and disappears under a bush The shoes pinch my toes as I crunch along the cinder street Cutting down alleys and through backyards gets me to Gales house in minutes His mother Hazelle sees me through the window where shes bent over the kitchen sink She dries her hands on her apron and disappears to meet me at the door I like Hazelle Respect her The explosion that killed my father took out her husband as well leaving her with three boys and a baby due any day Less than a week after she gave birth she was out hunting the streets for work The mines werent an option what with a baby to look after but she managed to get laundry from some of the merchants in townAt fourteen Gale the eldest of the kids became the main supporter of the family He was already signed up for tesserae which entitled them to a meager supply of grain and oil in exchange for his entering his name extra times in the drawing to become a tribute On top of that even back then he was a skilled trapper But it wasnt enough to keep a family of five without Hazelle working her fingers to the bone on that washboard In winter her hands got so red and cracked they bled at the slightest provocation Still would if it wasnt for a salve my mother concocted But they are determined Hazelle and Gale that the other boys twelve yearold Rory andtenyearold Vick and the baby fouryearold Posy will never have to sign up for tesserae Hazelle smiles when she sees the game She takes the beaver by the tail feeling itsweight Hes going to make a nice stew Unlike Gale she has no problem with our hunting arrangement Good pelt too I answer Its comforting here with Hazelle Weighing the merits of the game just as we always have She pours me a mug of herb tea which I wrap my chilled fingers around gratefully You know when I get back from the tour I was thinking I might take Rory out with me sometimes After school Teach him to shoot Hazelle nods Thatd be good Gale means to but hes only got his Sundays and I think he likes saving those for you I cant stop the redness that floods my cheeks Its stupid of course Hardly anybody knows me better than Hazelle Knows the bond I share with Gale Im sure plenty of people assumed that wed eventually get married even if I never gave it any thought But that was before the Games Before my fellow tribute Peeta Mellark announced he was madly in love with me Our romancebecame a key strategy for our survival in the arena Only it wasnt just a strategy for Peeta Im not sure what it was for me But I know now it was nothing but painful for Gale My chest tightens as I think about how on the Victory Tour Peeta and I will have to present ourselves as lovers again I gulp my tea even though its too hot and push back from the table I better get going Make myself presentable for the cameras Hazelle hugs me Enjoy the food Absolutely I say My next stop is the Hob where Ive traditionally done the bulk of my trading Years ago it was a warehouse to store coal but when it fell into disuse it became a meeting place for illegal trades and then blossomed into a fulltime black market If it attracts a somewhat criminal element then I belong here I guess Hunting in the woods surrounding District  violates at least a dozen laws and is punishable by death Although theynever mention it I owe the people who frequent the Hob Gale told me that Greasy Sae the old woman who serves up soup started a collection to sponsor Peeta and me during the Games It was supposed to be just a Hob thing but a lot of other people heard about it and chipped in I dont know exactly how much it was and the price of any gift in the arena was exorbitant But for all I know it made the difference between my life and death Its still odd to drag open the front door with an empty game bag with nothing to trade and instead feel the heavy pocket of coins against my hip I try to hit as many stalls as possible spreading out my purchases of coffee buns eggs yarn and oil As an afterthought I buy three bottles of white liquor from a onearmed woman named Ripper a victim of a mine accident who was smart enough to find a way to stay alive The liquor isnt for my family Its for Haymitchwho acted as mentor for Peeta and me in the Games Hes surly violent and drunk most of the time But he did his job  more than his jobbecause for the first time in history two tributes were allowed to win So no matter who Haymitch is I owe him too And thats for always Im getting the white liquor because a few weeks ago he ran out and there was none for sale and he had a withdrawal shaking and screaming at terrifying things only he could see He scared Prim to death and frankly it wasnt much fun for me to see him like that either Ever since then Ive been sort of stockpiling the stuff just in case theres a shortage again Cray our Head Peacekeeper frowns when he sees me with the bottles Hes an older man with a few strands of silver hair combed sideways above his bright red face That stuffs too strong for you girl He should know Next to Haymitch Cray drinks more than anyone Ive ever met Aw mymother uses it in medicines I say indifferently Well itd kill just about anything he says and slaps down a coin for a bottle When I reach Greasy Saes stall I boost myself up to sit on the counter and order some soup which looks to be some kind of gourd and bean mixture A Peacekeeper named Darius comes up and buys a bowl while Im eating As law enforcers go hes one of my favorites Never really throwing his weight around usually good for a joke Hes probably in his twenties but he doesnt seem much older than I do Something about his smile his red hair that sticks out every which way gives him a boyish quality Arent you supposed to be on a train he asks me Theyre collecting me at noon I answerShouldnt you look better he asks in a loud whisper I cant help smiling at his teasing in spite of my mood Maybea ribbon in your hair or something He flicks my braid with his hand and I brush him away Dont worry By the time they get through with me Ill be unrecognizable I say Good he says Lets show a little district pride for a change Miss Everdeen Hm He shakes his head at Greasy Sae in mock disapproval and walks off to join his friends Ill want that bowl back Greasy Sae calls after him but since shes laughing she doesnt sound particularly stern Gale going to see you off she asks me No he wasnt on the list I say I saw him Sunday though Think hed have made the list Him being your cousin and all she says wryly Its just one more part of the lie the Capitol has concocted When Peeta and I made it into the final eight in the Hunger Games they sent reporters to do personal stories about us When they asked about my friends everyone directed them to Gale But it wouldnt do what with the romance I was playing out inthe arena to have my best friend be Gale He was too handsome too male and not the least bit willing to smile and play nice for the cameras We do resemble each other though quite a bit We have that Seam look Dark straight hair olive skin gray eyes So some genius made him my cousin I didnt know about it until we were already home on the platform at the train station and my mother said Your cousins can hardly wait to see you Then I turned and saw Gale and Hazelle and all the kids waiting for me so what could I do but go along Greasy Sae knows were not related but even some of the people who have known us for years seem to have forgotten I just cant wait for the whole thing to be over I whisper I know says Greasy Sae But youve got to go through it to get to the end of it Better not be late A light snow starts to fall as I make my way to the Victors Village Its about a halfmile walk from the square in thecenter of town but it seems like another world entirely Its a separate community built around a beautiful green dotted with flowering bushes There are twelve houses each large enough to hold ten of the one I was raised in Nine stand empty as they always have The three in use belong to Haymitch Peeta and me The houses inhabited by my family and Peeta give off a warm glow of life Lit windows smoke from the chimneys bunches of brightly colored corn affixed to the front doors as decoration for the upcoming Harvest Festival However Haymitchs house despite the care taken by the groundskeeper exudes an air of abandonment and neglect I brace myself at his front door knowing it will be foul then push inside My nose immediately wrinkles in disgust Haymitch refuses to let anyone in to clean and does a poor job himself Over the years the odors of liquor and vomit boiled cabbage andburned meat unwashed clothes and mouse droppings have intermingled into a stench that brings tears to my eyes I wade through a litter of discarded wrappings broken glass and bones to where I know I will find Haymitch He sits at the kitchen table his arms sprawled across the wood his face in a puddle of liquor snoring his head off I nudge his shoulder Get up I say loudly because Ive learned theres no subtle way to wake him His snoring stops for a moment questioningly and then resumes I push him harder Get up Haymitch Its tour day I force the window up inhaling deep breaths of the clean air outside My feet shift through the garbage on the floor and I unearth a tin coffeepot and fill it at the sink The stove isnt completely out and I manage to coax the few live coals into a flame I pour some ground coffee into the pot enough to make sure the resulting brew will be good and strong and set it on the stove to boilHaymitch is still dead to the world Since nothing else has worked I fill a basin with icy cold water dump it on his head and spring out of the way A guttural animal sound comes from his throat He jumps up kicking his chair ten feet behind him and wielding a knife I forgot he always sleeps with one clutched in his hand I should have pried it from his fingers but Ive had a lot on my mind Spewing profanity he slashes the air a few moments before coming to his senses He wipes his face on his shirtsleeve and turns to the windowsill where I perch just in case I need to make a quick exit What are you doing he sputters You told me to wake you an hour before the cameras come I say What he says Your idea I insist He seems to remember Why am I all wet I couldnt shake you awake I say Look if you wanted to be babied you should have asked Peeta Asked me what Just the sound of his voice twists mystomach into a knot of unpleasant emotions like guilt sadness and fear And longing I might as well admit theres some of that too Only it has too much competition to ever win out I watch as Peeta crosses to the table the sunlight from the window picking up the glint of fresh snow in his blond hair He looks strong and healthy so different from the sick starving boy I knew in the arena and you can barely even notice his limp now He sets a loaf of freshbaked bread on the table and holds out his hand to Haymitch Asked you to wake me without giving me pneumonia says Haymitch passing over his knife He pulls off his filthy shirt revealing an equally soiled undershirt and rubs himself down with the dry part Peeta smiles and douses Haymitchs knife in white liquor from a bottle on the floor He wipes the blade clean on his shirttail and slices the bread Peeta keeps all of us in fresh baked goods I hunt He bakes Haymitchdrinks We have our own ways to stay busy to keep thoughts of our time as contestants in the Hunger Gamesat bay Its not until hes handed Haymitch the heel that he even looks at me for the first time Would you like a piece No I ate at the Hob I say But thank you My voice doesnt sound like my own its so formal Just as its been every time Ive spoken to Peeta since the cameras finished filming our happy homecoming and we returned to our real lives Youre welcome he says back stiffly Haymitch tosses his shirt somewhere into the mess Brrr You two have got a lot of warming up to do before showtime Hes right of course The audience will be expecting the pair of lovebirds who won the Hunger Games Not two people who can barely look each other in the eye But all I say is Take a bath Haymitch Then I swing out thewindow drop to the ground and head across the green to my house The snow has begun to stick and I leave a trail of footprints behind me At the front door I pause to knock the wet stuff from my shoes before I go in My mothers been working day and night to make everything perfect for the cameras so its no time to be tracking up her shiny floors Ive barely stepped inside when shes there holding my arm as if to stop me Dont worry Im taking them off here I say leaving my shoes on the mat My mother gives an odd breathy laugh and removes the game bag loaded with supplies from my shoulder Its just snow Did you have a nice walk Walk She knows Ive been in the woods half the night Then I see the man standing behind her in the kitchen doorway One look at his tailored suit and surgically perfected features and I know hes from the Capitol Something is wrong It was more like skating Its reallygetting slippery out there Someones here to see you says my mother Her face is too pale and I can hear the anxiety shes trying to hide I thought they werent due until noon I pretend not to notice her state Did Cinna come early to help me get ready No Katniss its  my mother begins This way please Miss Everdeen says the man He gestures down the hallway Its weird to be ushered around your own home but I know better than to comment on it As I go I give my mother a reassuring smile over my shoulder Probably more instructions for the tour Theyve been sending me all kinds of stuff about my itinerary and what protocol will be observed in each district But as I walk toward the door of the study a door I have never even seen closed until this moment I can feel my mind begin to race Who is here What do they want Why is my mother so pale Go right in says the Capitol man who has followed medown the hallway I twist the polished brass knob and step inside My nose registers the conflicting scents of roses and blood A small whitehaired man who seems vaguely familiar is reading a book He holds up a finger as if to say Give me a moment Then he turns and my heart skips a beat Im staring into the snakelikeeyes of President Snow In my mind President Snow should be viewed in front of marble pillars hung with oversized flags Its jarring to see him surrounded by the ordinary objects in the room Like taking the lid off a pot and finding a fanged viper instead of stew What could he be doing here My mind rushes back to the opening days of other Victory Tours I remember seeing the winning tributes with their mentors and stylists Even some high government officials have made appearances occasionally But I havenever seen President Snow He attends celebrations in the Capitol Period If hes made the journey all the way from his city it can only mean one thing Im in serious trouble And if I am so is my family A shiver goes through me when I think of the proximity of my mother and sister to this man who despises me Will always despise me Because I outsmarted his sadistic Hunger Games made the Capitol look foolish and consequently undermined his control All I was doing was trying to keep Peeta and myself alive Any act of rebellion was purely coincidental But when the Capitol decrees that only one tribute can live and you have the audacity to challenge it I guess thats a rebellion in itself My only defense was pretending that I was driven insane by a passionate love for Peeta So we were both allowed to live To be crowned victors To go home and celebrate and wave goodbye to the cameras and be left alone Until nowPerhaps it is the newness of the house or the shock of seeing him or the mutual understanding that he could have me killed in a second that makes me feel like the intruder As if this is his home and Im the uninvited party So I dont welcome him or offer him a chair I dont say anything In fact I treat him as if hes a real snake the venomous kind I stand motionless my eyes locked on him considering plans of retreat I think well make this whole situation a lot simpler by agreeing not to lie to each other he says What do you think I think my tongue has frozen and speech will be impossible so I surprise myself by answering back in a steady voice Yes I think that would save time President Snow smiles and I notice his lips for the first time Im expecting snake lips which is to say none But his are overly full the skin stretched too tight I have to wonder if his mouth has been altered to make him more appealing If so itwas a waste of time and money because hes not appealing at all My advisors were concerned you would be difficult but youre not planning on being difficult are you he asks No I answer Thats what I told them I said any girl who goes to such lengths to preserve her life isnt going to be interested in throwing it away with both hands And then theres her family to think of Her mother her sister and all those  cousins By the way he lingers on the word cousins I can tell he knows that Gale and I dont share a family treeWell its all on the table now Maybe thats better I dont do well with ambiguous threats Id much rather know the score Lets sit President Snow takes a seat at the large desk of polished wood where Prim does her homework and my mother her budgets Like our home this is a place that he has no right but ultimately every right to occupy I sit in front of the desk on one of the carved straightbacked chairs Its made for someone taller than I am so only my toes rest on the ground I have a problem Miss Everdeen says President Snow A problem that began the moment you pulled out those poisonous berries in the arena That was the moment when I guessed that if the Gamemakers had to choose between watching Peeta and me commit suicidewhich would mean having no victor and letting us both live they would take the latter If the Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane had had any brains hed have blown you to dust right then But he had an unfortunate sentimental streak So here you are Can you guess where he is he asks I nod because by the way he says it its clear that Seneca Crane has been executed The smell of roses and blood has grown stronger now that only a desk separates usTheres a rose in President Snows lapel which at least suggests a source of the flower perfume but it must be genetically enhanced because no real rose reeks like that As for the blood  I dont know After that there was nothing to do but let you play out your little scenario And you were pretty good too with the lovecrazed schoolgirl bit The people in the Capitol were quite convinced Unfortunately not everyone in the districts fell for your act he says My face must register at least a flicker of bewilderment because he addresses it This of course you dont know You have no access to information about the mood in other districts In several of them however people viewed your little trick with the berries as an act of defiance not an act of love And if a girl from District Twelve of all places can defy the Capitol and walk away unharmed what is to stop them from doing the same he says What is toprevent say an uprising It takes a moment for his last sentence to sink in Then the full weight of it hits me There have been uprisings I ask both chilled and somewhat elated by the possibility Not yet But theyll follow if the course of things doesnt change And uprisings have been known to lead to revolution President Snow rubs a spot over his left eyebrow the very spot where I myself get headaches Do you have any idea what that would mean How many people would die What conditions those left would have to face Whatever problems anyone may have with the Capitol believe me when I say that if it released its grip on the districts for even a short time the entire system would collapse Im taken aback by the directness and even the sincerity of this speech As if his primary concern is the welfare of the citizens of Panem when nothing could be further from the truth I dont know how I dare to say thenext words but I do It must be very fragile if a handful of berries can bring it down Theres a long pause while he examines me Then he simplysays It is fragile but not in the way that you suppose Theres a knock at the door and the Capitol man sticks his head in Her mother wants to know if you want tea I would I would like tea says the president The door opens wider and there stands my mother holding a tray with a china tea set she brought to the Seam when she married Set it here please He places his book on the corner of the desk and pats the center My mother sets the tray on the desk It holds a china teapot and cups cream and sugar and a plate of cookies They are beautifully iced with softly colored flowers The frosting work can only be Peetas What a welcome sight You know its funny how often people forgetthat presidents need to eat too President Snow says charmingly Well it seems to relax my mother a bit anyway Can I get you anything else I can cook something more substantial if youre hungry she offers No this could not be more perfect Thank you he says clearly dismissing her My mother nods shoots me a glance and goes President Snow pours tea for both of us and fills his with cream and sugar then takes a long time stirring I sense he has had his say and is waiting for me to respond I didnt mean to start any uprisings I tell him I believe you It doesnt matter Your stylist turned out to be prophetic in his wardrobe choice Katniss Everdeen the girl who was on fire you have provided a spark that left unattended may grow to an inferno that destroys Panem he says Why dont you just kill me now I blurt out Publicly he asks That would only add fuel to the flames Arrange an accident then Isay Who would buy it he asks Not you if you were watching Then just tell me what you want me to do Ill do it I say If only it were that simple He picks up one of the flowered cookies and examines it Lovely Your mother made these Peeta And for the first time I find I cant hold his gaze I reach for my tea but set it back down when I hear the cup rattling against the saucer To cover I quickly take a cookie Peeta How is the love of your life he asks Good I say At what point did he realize the exact degree of your indifference he asks dipping his cookie in his tea Im not indifferent I say But perhaps not as taken with the young man as you would have the country believe he says Who says Im not I say I do says the president And I wouldnt be here if I were the only person who had doubts Hows the handsome cousin I dont know  I dont  My revulsion at this conversation at discussing my feelings fortwo of the people I care most about with President Snow chokes me off Speak Miss Everdeen Him I can easily kill off if we dont come to a happy resolution he says You arent doing him a favor by disappearing into the woods with him each Sunday If he knows this what else does heknow And how does he know it Many people could tell him that Gale and I spend our Sundays hunting Dont we show up at the end of each one loaded down with game Havent we for years The real question is what he thinks goes on in the woods beyond District  Surely they havent been tracking us in there Or have they Could we have been followed That seems impossible At least by a person Cameras That never crossed my mind until this moment The woods have always been our place of safety our place beyond the reach of the Capitol where were free to say whatwe feel be who we are At least before the Games If weve been watched since what have they seen Two people hunting saying treasonous things against the Capitol yes But not two people in love which seems to be President Snows implication We are safe on that charge Unless  unless  It only happened once It was fast and unexpected but it did happen After Peeta and I got home from the Games it was several weeks before I saw Gale alone First there were the obligatory celebrations A banquet for the victors that only the most highranking people were invited to A holiday for the whole district with free food and entertainers brought in from the Capitol Parcel Day the first of twelve in which food packages were delivered to every person in the district That was my favorite To see all those hungry kids in the Seam running around waving cans of applesauce tins of meat even candy Back home too big tocarry would be bags of grain cans of oil To know that once a month for a year they would all receive another parcel That was one of the few times I actually felt good about winning the Games So between the ceremonies and events and the reporters documenting my every move as I presided and thanked and kissed Peeta for the audience I had no privacy at all After a few weeks things finally died down The camera crews and reporters packed up and went home Peeta and I assumed the cool relationship weve had ever since My family settled into our house in the Victors Village The everyday life of District workers to the mines kids to school  resumed its usual pace I waited until I thought the coast was really clear and then one Sunday without telling anyone I got up hours before dawn and took off for the woods The weather was still warm enough that I didnt need a jacket I packed along a bag filled with specialfoods cold chicken and cheese and bakery bread and oranges Down at my old house I put on my hunting boots As usual the fence was not charged and it was simple to slip into the woods and retrieve my bow and arrows I went to our place Gales and mine where we had shared breakfast the morning of the reaping that sent me into the Games I waited at least two hours Id begun to think that hed given up on me in the weeks that had passed Or that he no longer cared about me Hated me even And the idea of losing him forevermy best friend the only person Id ever trusted with my secrets was so painful I couldnt stand it Not on top of everything else that had happened I could feel my eyes tearing up and my throat starting to close the way it does when I get upset Then I looked up and there he was ten feetaway just watching me Without even thinking I jumped up and threw my arms around him making some weird sound that combined laughing choking and crying He was holding me so tightly that I couldnt see his face but it was a really long time before he let me go and then he didnt have much choice because Id gotten this unbelievably loud case of the hiccups and had to get a drink We did what we always did that day Ate breakfast Hunted and fished and gathered Talked about people in town But not about us his new life in the mines my time in the arena Just about other things By the time we were at the hole in the fence thats nearest the Hob I think I really believed that things could be the same That we could go on as we always had Id given all the game to Gale to trade since we had so much food now I told him Id skip the Hob even though I was looking forward to going there because my mother andsister didnt even know Id gone hunting and theyd be wondering where I was Then suddenly as I was suggesting I take over the daily snare run he took my face in his hands and kissed me I was completely unprepared You would think that after all the hours Id spent with Galewatching him talk and laugh and frown  that I would know all there was to know about his lips But I hadnt imagined how warm they would feel pressed against my own Or how those hands which could set the most intricate of snares could as easily entrap me I think I made some sort of noise in the back of my throat and I vaguely remember my fingers curled tightly closed resting on his chest Then he let go and said I had to do that At least once And he was gone Despite the fact that the sun was setting and my family would be worried I sat by a tree next to the fence I tried to decide how I felt about the kiss if I had liked it or resented it but allI really remembered was the pressure of Gales lips and the scent of the oranges that still lingered on his skin It was pointless comparing it with the many kisses Id exchanged with Peeta I still hadnt figured out if any of those counted Finally I went home That week I managed the snares and dropped off the meat with Hazelle But I didnt see Gale until Sunday I had this whole speech worked out about how I didnt want a boyfriend and never planned on marrying but I didnt end up using it Gale acted as if the kiss had never happened Maybe he was waiting for me to say something Or kiss him back Instead I just pretended it had never happened either But it had Gale had shattered some invisible barrier between us and with it any hope I had of resuming our old uncomplicatedfriendship Whatever I pretended I could never lookat his lips in quite the same way This all flashes through my head in an instant as President Snows eyes bore into me on the heels of his threat to kill Gale How stupid Ive been to think the Capitol would just ignore me once Id returned home Maybe I didnt know about the potential uprisings But I knew they were angry with me Instead of acting with the extreme caution the situation called for what have I done From the presidents point of view Ive ignored Peeta and flaunted my preference for Gales company before the whole district And by doing so made it clear I was in fact mocking the Capitol Now Ive endangered Gale and his family and my family and Peeta too by my carelessness Please dont hurt Gale I whisper Hes just my friend Hes been my friend for years Thats all thats between us Besides everyone thinks were cousins now Im only interested in how it affects your dynamic with Peeta therebyaffecting the mood in the districts he says It will be the same on the tour Ill be in love with him just as I was I sayJust as you are corrects President Snow Just as I am I confirm Only youll have to do even better if the uprisings are to be averted he says This tour will be your only chance to turn things around I know I will Ill convince everyone in the districts that I wasnt defying the Capitol that I was crazy with love I say President Snow rises and dabs his puffy lips with a napkin Aim higher in case you fall short What do you mean How can I aim higher I ask Convince me he says He drops the napkin and retrieves his book I dont watch him as he heads for the door so I flinch when he whispers in my ear By the way I know about the kiss Then the door clicks shut behind him The smell of blood  it was on his breath What does he do Ithink Drink it I imagine him sipping it from a teacup Dipping a cookie into the stuff and pulling it out dripping red Outside the window a car comes to life soft and quiet like the purr of a cat then fades away into the distance It slips off as it arrived unnoticed The room seems to be spinning in slow lopsided circles and I wonder if I might black out I lean forward and clutch the desk with one hand The other still holds Peetas beautiful cookie I think it had a tiger lily on it but now its been reduced to crumbs in my fist I didnt even know I was crushing it but I guess I had to hold on to something while my world veered out of control A visit from President Snow Districts on the verge of uprisings A direct death threat to Gale with others to follow Everyone I love doomed And who knows who else will pay for my actions Unless I turn things around on this tour Quiet the discontent and put the presidents mind at rest And how Byproving to the country beyond any shadow of a doubt that I love Peeta Mellark I cant do it I think Im not that good Peetas the good one the likable one He can make people believe anything Im the one who shuts up and sits back and lets him do as much of the talking as possible But it isnt Peeta who has to prove his devotion Its me I hear my mothers light quick tread in the hall She cant know I think Not about any of this I reach my hands over the tray and quickly brush the bits of cookie from my palm and fingers I take a shaky sip of my tea Is everything all right Katniss she asks Its fine We never see it on television but the president always visits the victors before the tour to wish them luck I say brightly My mothers face floods with relief Oh I thought there was some kind of trouble No not at all I say The trouble will start when my prep team sees how Ive let my eyebrows grow back in My motherlaughs and I think about how there was no going back after I took over caring for the family when I was eleven How I will always have to protect her Why dont I start your bath she asks Great I say and I can see howpleased she is by my response Since Ive been home Ive been trying hard to mend my relationship with my mother Asking her to do things for me instead of brushing aside any offer of help as I did for years out of anger Letting her handle all the money I won Returning her hugs instead of tolerating them My time in the arena made me realize how I needed to stop punishing her for something she couldnt help specifically the crushing depression she fell into after my fathers death Because sometimes things happen to people and theyre not equipped to deal with them Like me for instance Right now Besides theres onewonderful thing she did when I arrived back in the district After our families and friends had greeted Peeta and me at the train station there were a few questions allowed from reporters Someone asked my mother what she thought of my new boyfriend and she replied that while Peeta was the very model of what a young man should be I wasnt old enough to have any boyfriend at all She followed this with a pointed look at Peeta There was a lot of laughter and comments like Somebodys in trouble from the press and Peeta dropped my hand and sidestepped away from me That didnt last longthere was too much pressure to act otherwisebut it gave us an excuse to be a little more reserved than wed been in the Capitol And maybe it can help account for how little Ive been seen in Peetas company since the cameras left I go upstairs to the bathroom where a steaming tub awaits My mother has added a small bag ofdried flowers that perfumes the air None of us are used to the luxury of turning on a tap and having a limitless supply of hot water at our fingertips We had only cold at our home in the Seam and a bath meant boiling the rest over the fire I undress and lower myself into the silky watermy mother has poured in some kind of oil as well  and try to get a grip on things The first question is who to tell if anyone Not my mother or Prim obviously theyd only become sick with worry Not Gale Even if I could get word to him What would he do with the information anyway If he were alone I might try to persuade him to run away Certainly he could survive in the woods But hes not alone and hed never leave his family Or me When I get home Ill have to tell him something about why our Sundays are a thing of the past but I cant think about that now Only about my next move Besides Gales already so angry andfrustrated with the Capitol that I sometimes think hes going to arrange his own uprising The last thing he needs is an incentive No I cant tell anyone Im leaving behind in District  There are still three people I might confide in starting with Cinna my stylist But my guess is Cinna might already be at risk and I dont want to pull him into any more trouble by closer association with me Then theres Peeta who will be my partner in this deception but how do I begin thatconversation Hey Peeta remember how I told you I was kind of faking being in love with you Well I really need you to forget about that now and act extra in love with me or the president might kill Gale I cant do it Besides Peeta will perform well whether he knows whats at stake or not That leaves Haymitch Drunken cranky confrontationalHaymitch who I just poured a basin of ice water on As my mentor in the Games it was his duty to keep me alive I only hope hes still up for the job I slide down into the water letting it block out the sounds around me I wish the tub would expand so I could go swimming like I used to on hot summer Sundays in the woods with my father Those days were a special treat We would leave early in the morning and hike farther into the woods than usual to a small lake hed found while hunting I dont even remember learning to swim I was so young when he taught me I just remember diving turning somersaults and paddling around The muddy bottom of the lake beneath my toes The smell of blossoms and greenery Floating on my back as I am now staring at the blue sky while the chatter of the woods was muted by the water Hed bag the waterfowl that nested around the shore Id hunt for eggs in the grasses and wedboth dig for katniss roots the plant for which he named me in the shallows At night when we got home my mother would pretend not to recognize me because I was so clean Then shed cook up an amazing dinner of roasted duck and baked katniss tubers with gravy I never took Gale to the lake I could have Its timeconsuming to get there but the waterfowl are such easy pickings you can make up for lost hunting time Its a place Ive never really wanted to share with anyone though a place that belonged only to my father and me Since the Games when Ive had little to occupy my days Ive gone there a couple of times The swimming was still nice but mostly the visits depressed me Over the course of the last five years the lakes remarkably unchanged and Im almost unrecognizable Even underwater I can hear the sounds of commotion Honking car horns shouts of greeting doors banging shut It can only mean myentourage has arrived I just have time to towel off and slip into a robe before my prep team bursts into the bathroom Theres no question of privacy When it comes to my body we have no secrets these three people and me Katniss your eyebrows Venia shrieks right off and even with the black cloud hanging over me I have to stifle a laugh Her aqua hair has been styled so it sticks out in sharp points all over her head and the gold tattoos that used to be confined above her brows have curled around under her eyes all contributing to the impression that Ive literally shocked her Octavia comes up and pats Venias back soothingly her curvy body looking plumper than usual next to Venias thin angular one There there You can fix those in no time Butwhat am I going to do with these nails She grabs my hand and pins it flat between her two pea green ones No herskin isnt exactly pea green now Its more of a light evergreen The shift in shade is no doubt an attempt to stay abreast of the capricious fashion trends of the Capitol Really Katniss you could have left me something to work with she wails Its true Ive bitten my nails to stubs in the past couple of months I thought about trying to break the habit but couldnt think of a good reason I should Sorry I mutter I hadnt really been spending much time worrying about how it might affect my prep team Flavius lifts a few strands of my wet tangled hair He gives his head a disapproving shake causing his orange corkscrew curls to bounce around Has anyone touched this since you last saw us he asks sternly Remember we specifically asked you to leave your hair alone Yes I say grateful that I can show I havent totally taken them for granted I mean no no ones cut it I did remember that No I didnt Its more like theissue never came up Since Ive been home all Ive done is stick it in its usual old braid down my back This seems to mollify them and they all kiss me set me on a chair in my bedroom and as usual start talking nonstop without bothering to notice if Im listening While Venia reinvents my eyebrows and Octavia gives me fake nails and Flavius massages goo into my hair I hear all about the Capitol What a hit the Games were how dull things have been since how no one can wait until Peeta and I visit again at the end of the Victory Tour After that it wont be long before the Capitol begins gearing up for the Quarter Quell Isnt it thrilling Dont you feel so lucky In your very first year of being a victor you get to be a mentor in a Quarter Quell Their words overlap in a blur of excitement Oh yes I say neutrally Its the best I can do In a normal year being a mentor to the tributes is the stuff of nightmares I cant walkby the school now without wondering what kid Ill have to coach But to make things even worse this is the year of the Seventyfifth Hunger Games and that means its also a Quarter Quell They occur every twentyfive years marking the anniversary of the districts defeat with overthetop celebrations and for extra fun some miserable twist for the tributes Ive never been alive for one of course But in school I remember hearing that for the second Quarter Quell the Capitol demanded that twice the number of tributes be provided for the arena The teachers didnt go into much more detail which is surprising because that was the year District s very own Haymitch Abernathy won the crown Haymitch better be preparing himself for a lot of attention squeals Octavia Haymitch has never mentioned his personal experience in the arena to me I would never ask And if I ever saw his Games televised in rerunsI mustve been too young to remember it But the Capitol wont let him forget it this year In a way its a good thing Peeta and I will both be available as mentors during the Quell because its a sure bet that Haymitch will be wasted After theyve exhausted the topic of the Quarter Quell my prep team launches into a whole lot of stuff about their incomprehensibly silly lives Who said what about someone Ive never heard of and what sort of shoes they just bought and a long story from Octavia about what a mistake it was to have everyone wear feathers to her birthday party Soon my brows are stinging my hairs smooth and silky and my nails are ready to be painted Apparently theyve been given instruction to prepare only my hands and face probably because everything else will be covered in the cold weather Flavius badly wants to use his own trademark purple lipstick on me but resigns himself to a pink as they begin to color my face and nails I can see by the palette Cinna has assigned that were going for girlish not sexy Good Ill never convince anyone of anything if Im trying to be provocative Haymitch made that very clear when he was coaching me for my interview for the Games My mother comes in somewhat shyly and says that Cinna has asked her to show the preps how she did my hair the day of the reaping They respond with enthusiasm and then watch thoroughly engrossed as she breaks down the process of the elaborate braided hairdo In the mirror I can see their earnest faces following her every move their eagerness when it is their turn to try a step In fact all three are so readily respectful and nice to my mother that I feel bad about how I go around feeling so superior to them Who knows who I would be or what I would talk about if Id been raised in the Capitol Maybe mybiggest regret would be having feathered costumes at my birthday party too When my hair is done I find Cinna downstairs in the living room and just the sight of him makes me feel more hopeful He looks the same as always simple clothes short brown hair just a hint of gold eyeliner We embrace and I can barely keep from spilling out the entire episode with President Snow But no Ive decided to tell Haymitch first Hell know best who to burden with it Its so easy to talk to Cinna though Lately weve been speaking a lot on the telephone that came with the house Its sort of a joke because almost no one else we know owns one Theres Peeta but obviously I dont call him Haymitch tore his out of the wall years ago My friend Madge the mayors daughter has a telephone in her house but if we want to talk we do it in person At first the thing barely ever got used Then Cinna started to call to work on my talent Everyvictor is supposed to have one Your talent is the activity you take up since you dont have to work either in school or your districts industry It can be anything really anything that they can interview you about Peeta it turns out actually has a talent which is painting Hes been frosting those cakes and cookies for years in his familys bakery But now that hes rich he can afford to smear real paint on canvases I dont have a talent unless you count hunting illegally which they dont Or maybe singing which I wouldnt do for the Capitol in a million years My mother tried to interest me in a variety of suitable alternatives from a list Effie Trinket sent her Cooking flower arranging playing the flute None of them took although Prim had a knack for all three Finally Cinna stepped in and offered to help me develop my passion for designing clothes which really required development since it was nonexistent But Isaid yes because it meant getting to talk to Cinna and he promised hed do all the work Now hes arranging things around my living room clothing fabrics andsketchbooks with designs hes drawn I pick up one of the sketchbooks and examine a dress I supposedly created You know I think I show a lot of promise I say Get dressed you worthless thing he says tossing a bundle of clothes at me I may have no interest in designing clothes but I do love the ones Cinna makes for me Like these Flowing black pants made of a thick warm material A comfortable white shirt A sweater woven from green and blue and gray strands of kittensoft wool Laced leather boots that dont pinch my toes Did I design my outfit I ask No you aspire to design your outfit and be like me your fashion hero says Cinna He hands me a small stack ofcards Youll read these off camera while theyre filming the clothes Try to sound like you care Just then Effie Trinket arrives in a pumpkin orange wig to remind everyone Were on a schedule She kisses me on both cheeks while waving in the camera crew then orders me into position Effies the only reason we got anywhere on time in the Capitol so I try to accommodate her I start bobbing around like a puppet holding up outfits and saying meaningless things like Dont you love it The sound team records me reading from my cards in a chirpy voice so they can insert it later then Im tossed out of the room so they can film myCinnas designs in peace Prim got out early from school for the event Now she stands in the kitchen being interviewed by another crew She looks lovely in a sky blue frock that brings out her eyes her blond hair pulled back in a matching ribbon Shes leaning a bit forward on thetoes of her shiny white boots like shes about to take flight like Bam Its like someone actually hits me in the chest No one has of course but the pain is so real I take a step back I squeeze my eyes shut and I dont see Prim I see Rue the twelveyearold girl from District  who was my ally in the arena She could fly birdlike from tree to tree catching on to the slenderest branches Rue who I didnt save Who I let die I picture her lying on the ground with the spear still wedged in her stomach  Who else will I fail to save from the Capitols vengeance Who else will be dead if I dont satisfy President Snow I realize Cinnas trying to put a coat on me so I raise my arms I feel fur inside and out encasing me Its from no animal Ive ever seen Ermine he tells me as I stroke the white sleeve Leather gloves A bright red scarf Something furry covers my ears Youre bringing earmuffs back in style I hate earmuffs I think They make itcards Youll read these

make ithard to hear and since I was blasted deaf in one ear in the arena I dislike them even more After I won the Capitol repaired my ear but I still find myself testing it My mother hurries up with something cupped in her hand For good luck she says Its the pin Madge gave me before I left for the Games A mockingjay flying in a circle of gold Itried to give it to Rue but she wouldnt take it She said the pin was the reason shed decided to trust me Cinna fixes it on the knot in the scarf Effie Trinkets nearby clapping her hands Attention everyone Were about to do the first outdoor shot where the victors greet each other at the beginning of their marvelous trip All right Katniss big smile youre very excited right I dont exaggerate when I say she shoves me out the door For a moment I cant quite see right because of the snow which is now coming down inearnest Then I make out Peeta coming through his front door In my head I hear President Snows directive Convince me And I know I must My face breaks into a huge smile and I start walking in Peetas direction Then as if I cant stand it another second I start running He catches me and spins me around and then he slips  he still isnt entirely in command of his artificial legand we fall into the snow me on top of him and thats where we have our first kiss in months Its full of fur and snowflakes and lipstick but underneath all that I can feel the steadiness that Peeta brings to everything And I know Im not alone As badly as I have hurt him he wont expose me in front of the cameras Wont condemn me with a halfhearted kiss Hes still looking out for me Just as he did in the arena Somehow the thought makes me want to cry Instead I pull him to his feet tuck my glove through the crook of his arm and merrily pull him onour way The rest of the day is a blur of getting to the station bidding everyone goodbye the train pulling out the old team  Peeta and me Effie and Haymitch Cinna and Portia Peetas stylistdining on an indescribably delicious meal I dont remember And then Im swathed in pajamas and a voluminous robe sitting in my plush compartment waiting for the others to go to sleep I know Haymitch will be up for hours He doesnt like to sleep when its dark out When the train seems quiet I put on my slippers and pad down to his door I have to knock several times before he answers scowling as if hes certain Ive brought bad news What do you want he says nearly knocking me out with a cloud of wine fumes I have to talk to you I whisper Now he says I nod This better be good He waits but I feel certain every word we utter on a Capitol train is being recorded Well he barks The train starts to brake and for asecond I think President Snow is watching me and doesnt approve of my confiding in Haymitch and has decided to go ahead and kill me now But were just stopping for fuel The trains so stuffy I say Its a harmless phrase but I see Haymitchs eyes narrow in understanding I know what you need He pushes past me and lurches down the hall to a door When he wrestles it open a blast of snow hits us He trips out onto the ground A Capitol attendant rushes to help but Haymitch waves her awaygoodnaturedly as he staggers off Just want some fresh air Only be a minute Sorry Hes drunk I say apologetically Ill get him I hop down and stumble along the track behind him soaking my slippers with snow as he leads me beyond the end of the train so we will not be overheard Then he turns on me What I tell himeverything About the presidents visit about Gale about how were all going to die if I fail His face sobers grows older in the glow of the red taillights Then you cant fail If you could just help me get through this trip I begin No Katniss its not just this trip he says What do you mean I say Even if you pull it off theyll be back in another few months to take us all to the Games You and Peeta youll be mentors now every year from here on out And every year theyll revisit the romance and broadcast the details of your private life and youll never ever be able to do anything but live happily ever after with that boy The full impact of what hes saying hits me I will never have a life with Gale even if I want to I will never be allowed to live alone I will have to be forever in love with Peeta The Capitol will insist on it Ill have a few years maybe because Im still only sixteen to stay with my mother and Prim Andthen  and then  Do you understand what I mean he presses me I nod He means theres only one future if I want to keep those I love alive and stay alive myself Ill have to marry Peeta We slog back to the train in silence In the hallway outside my door Haymitch gives my shoulder a pat and says You could do a lot worse you know He heads off to his compartment taking the smell of wine with him In my room I remove my sodden slippers my wet robe and pajamas There are more in the drawers but I just crawl between the covers of my bed in my underclothes I stare into the darkness thinking about my conversation with Haymitch Everything he said was true about the Capitols expectations my future with Peeta even his last comment Of course I could do a lot worse than Peeta That isnt really the point though is it One of the few freedoms we have in District  is the right to marry who we want or not marry atall And now even that has been taken away from me I wonder if President Snow will insist we have children If we do theyll have to face the reaping each year And wouldnt it be something to see the child of not one but two victors chosen for the arena Victors children have been in the ring before It always causes a lot of excitement and generates talk about how the odds are not in that familys favor But it happens too frequently to just be about odds Gales convinced the Capitol does it on purpose rigs the drawings to add extra drama Given all the trouble Ive caused Ive probably guaranteed any child of mine a spot in the Games I think of Haymitch unmarried no familyblotting out the world with drink He could have had his choice of any woman in the district And he chose solitude Not solitude that sounds too peaceful More likesolitary confinement Was it because having been in the arena he knew it was better than risking the alternative I had a taste of that alternative when they called Prims name on reaping day and I watched her walk to the stage to her death But as her sister I could take her place an option forbidden to our mother My mind searches frantically for a way out I cant let President Snow condemn me to this Even if it means taking my own life Before that though Id try to run away What would they do if I simply vanished Disappeared into the woods and never came out Could I even manage to take everyone I love with me start a new life deep in the wild Highly unlikely but not impossible I shake my head to clear it This is not the time to be making wild escape plans I must focus on the Victory Tour Too many peoples fates depend on my giving a good show Dawn comes before sleep does and theres Effie rapping on my door I pull on whatever clothes are at the top of the drawer and drag myself down to the dining car I dont see what difference it makes when I get up since this is a travel day but then it turns out that yesterdays makeover was just to get me to the train station Today Ill get the works from my prep team Why Its too cold for anything to show I grumble Not in District Eleven says Effie District  Our first stop Id rather start in any other district since this was Rues home But thats not how the Victory Tour works Usually it kicks off in  and then goes in descending district order to  followed by the Capitol The victors district is skipped and saved for very last Since  puts on the least fabulous celebration  usually just a dinner for the tributes and a victory rally in the square where nobody looks like theyre having any fun  its probably best to get usout of the way as soon as possible This year for the first time since Haymitch won the final stop on the tour will be  and the Capitol will spring for the festivities I try to enjoy the food like Hazelle said The kitchen staff clearly wants to please me Theyve prepared my favorite lamb stew with dried plums among other delicacies Orange juice and a pot of steaming hot chocolate wait at my place at the table So I eat a lot and the meal is beyond reproach but I cant say Im enjoying it Im also annoyed that no one but Effie and I has shown up Wheres everybody else I ask Oh who knows where Haymitch is says Effie I didnt really expect Haymitch because hes probably just getting to bed Cinna was up late working on organizing your garment car He must have over a hundred outfits for you Your evening clothes are exquisite And Peetas team is probably still asleep Doesnt he need prepping I ask Not the way youdo Effie replies What does this mean It means I get to spend the morning having the hair ripped off my body while Peeta sleeps in I hadnt thought about it much but in the arena at least some of the boys got to keep their body hair whereas none of the girls did I can remember Peetas now as I bathed him by the stream Very blond in the sunlight once the mud and blood had been washed away Only his face remained completely smooth Not one of the boys grew a beard and many were old enough to I wonder what they did to them If I feel ragged my prep team seems in worse condition knocking back coffee and sharing brightly colored little pills As far as I can tell they never get up before noon unless theres some sort of national emergency like my leg hair I was so happy when it grew back in too As if it were a sign that things might be returning to normal I run my fingers along the soft curlydown on my legs and give myself over to the team None of them are up to their usual chatter so I can hear everystrand being yanked from its follicle I have to soak in a tub full of a thick unpleasantsmelling solution while my face and hair are plastered with creams Two more baths follow in other less offensive concoctions Im plucked and scoured and massaged and anointed until Im raw Flavius tilts up my chin and sighs Its a shame Cinna said no alterations on you Yes we could really make you something special says Octavia When shes older says Venia almost grimly Then hell have to let us Do what Blow my lips up like President Snows Tattoo my breasts Dye my skin magenta and implant gems in it Cut decorative patterns in my face Give me curved talons Or cats whiskers I saw all these things and more on the people inthe Capitol Do they really have no idea how freakish they look to the rest of us The thought of being left to my prep teams fashion whims only adds to the miseries competing for my attention my abused body my lack of sleep my mandatory marriage and the terror of being unable to satisfy President Snows demands By the time I reach lunch where Effie Cinna Portia Haymitch and Peeta have started without me Im too weighed down to talk Theyre raving about the food and how well they sleep on trains Everyones all full of excitement about the tour Well everyone but Haymitch Hes nursing a hangover and picking at a muffin Im not really hungry either maybe because I loaded up on too much rich stuff this morning or maybe because Im so unhappy I play around with a bowl of broth eating only a spoonful or two I cant even look at Peetamy designated future husband although I know none of this ishis fault People notice try to bring me into the conversation but I just brush them off At some point the train stops Our server reports it will not just be for a fuel stop  some part has malfunctioned and must be replaced It will require at least an hour This sends Effie into a state She pulls out her schedule and begins to work out how the delay will impact every event for the rest of our lives Finally I just cant stand to listen to her anymore No one cares Effie I snap Everyone at the table stares at me even Haymitch who youd think would be on my side in this matter since Effie drives him nuts Im immediately put on the defensive Well no one does I say and get up and leave the dining car The train suddenly seems stifling and Im definitely queasy now I find the exit door force it open  triggering some sort of alarm which I ignore  and jump to the ground expecting to land in snow But the airs warm andbalmy against my skin The trees still wear green leaves How far south have we come in a day I walk along the track squinting against the bright sunlight already regretting my words to Effie Shes hardly to blame for my current predicament I should go back and apologize My outburst was the height of bad manners and manners matterdeeply to her But my feet continue on along the track past the end of the train leaving it behind An hours delay I can walk at least twenty minutes in one direction and make it back with plenty of time to spare Instead after a couple hundred yards I sink to the ground and sit there looking into the distance If I had a bow and arrows would I just keep going After a while I hear footsteps behind me Itll be Haymitch coming to chew me out Its not like I dont deserve it but I still dont want to hear it Im not in themood for a lecture I warn the clump of weeds by my shoes Ill try to keep it brief Peeta takes a seat beside me I thought you were Haymitch I say No hes still working on that muffin I watch as Peeta positions his artificial leg Bad day huh Its nothing I say He takes a deep breath Look Katniss Ive been wanting to talk to you about the way I acted on the train I mean the last train The one that brought us home I knew you had something with Gale I was jealous of him before I even officially met you And it wasnt fair to hold you to anything that happened in the Games Im sorry His apology takes me by surprise Its true that Peeta froze me out after I confessed that my love for him during the Games was something of an act But I dont hold that against him In the arena Id played that romance angle for all it was worth There had been times when I didnt honestly know how I felt about him I still dont really Im sorrytoo I say Im not sure for what exactly Maybe because theres a real chance Im about to destroy him Theres nothing for you to be sorry about You were just keeping us alive But I dont want us to go on like this ignoring each other in real life and falling into the snow every time theres a camera around So I thought if I stopped being so you know wounded we could take a shot at just being friends he says All my friends are probably going to end up dead but refusing Peeta wouldnt keep him safe Okay I say His offer does make me feel better Less duplicitous somehow It would be nice if hed come to me with this earlier before I knew that President Snow had other plans and just being friends was not an option for us anymore But either way Im glad were speaking again So whats wrong he asks I cant tell him I pick at the clump of weeds Lets start with something more basic Isnt it strangethat I know youd risk your life to save mine  but I dont know what your favorite color is he says A smile creeps onto my lips Green Whats yours Orange he says Orange Like Effies hair I say A bit more muted he says More like  sunset Sunset I can see it immediately the rim of the descending sun the sky streaked with soft shades of orange Beautiful I remember the tiger lily cookie and now that Peeta is talking to me again its all I can do not to recountthe whole story about President Snow But I know Haymitch wouldnt want me to Id better stick to small talk You know everyones always raving about your paintings I feel bad I havent seen them I say Well Ive got a whole train car full He rises and offers me his hand Come on Its good to feel his fingers entwined with mine again not forshow but in actual friendship We walk back to the train hand in hand At the door I remember Ive got to apologize to Effie first Dont be afraid to lay it on thick Peeta tells me So when we go back to the dining car where the others are still at lunch I give Effie an apology that I think is overkill but in her mind probably just manages to compensate for my breach of etiquette To her credit Effie accepts graciously She says its clear Im under a lot of pressure And her comments about the necessity of someone attending to the schedule only last about five minutes Really Ive gotten off easily When Effie finishes Peeta leads me down a few cars to see his paintings I dont know what I expected Larger versions of the flower cookies maybe But this is something entirely different Peeta has painted the Games Some you wouldnt get right away if you hadnt been with him in the arena yourself Water drippingthrough the cracks in our cave The dry pond bed A pair of hands his own digging for roots Others any viewer would recognize The golden horn called the Cornucopia Clove arranging the knives inside her jacket One of the mutts unmistakably the blond greeneyed one meant to be Glimmer snarling as it makes its way toward us And me I am everywhere High up in a tree Beating a shirt against the stones in the stream Lying unconscious in a pool of blood And one I cant place  perhaps this is how I looked when his fever was highemerging from a silver gray mist that matches my eyes exactly What do you think he asks I hate them I say I can almost smell the blood the dirt the unnatural breath of the mutt All I do is go around trying to forget the arena and youve brought it back to life How do you remember these things so exactly I see them every night he says I know what he means Nightmares  which Iwas no stranger to before the Games  now plague me whenever I sleep But the old standby the one of my father being blown to bits in the mines is rare Instead I relive versions of what happened in the arena My worthless attempt to save Rue Peeta bleeding to death Glimmers bloated body disintegrating in my hands Catos horrific end with the muttations These are the most frequent visitors Me too Does it help To paint them out I dont know I think Im a little less afraid of going to sleep at night or I tell myself I am he says But they havent gone anywhere Maybe they wont Haymitchs havent Haymitch doesnt say so but Im sure this is why he doesnt like to sleep in the darkNo But for me its better to wake up with a paintbrush than a knife in my hand he says So you really hate themYes But theyre extraordinary Really I say And they are But I dont want to look at them anymore Want to see my talent Cinna did a great job on it Peeta laughs Later The train lurches forward and I can see the land moving past us through the window Come on were almost to District Eleven Lets go take a look at itWe go down to the last car on the train There are chairs and couches to sit on but whats wonderful is that the back windows retract into the ceiling so youre riding outside in the fresh air and you can see a wide sweep of the landscape Huge open fields with herds of dairy cattle grazing in them So unlike our own heavily wooded home We slow slightly and I think we might be coming in for another stop when a fence rises up before us Towering at least thirtyfive feet in the air and topped with wicked coilsof barbed wire it makes ours back in District  look childish My eyes quickly inspect the base which is lined with enormous metal plates There would be no burrowing under those no escaping to hunt Then I see the watchtowers placed evenly apart manned with armed guards so out of place among the fields of wildflowers around them Thats something different says Peeta Rue did give me the impression that the rules in District  were more harshly enforced But I never imagined something like this Now the crops begin stretched out as far as the eye can see Men women and children wearing straw hats to keep off the sun straighten up turn our way take a moment to stretch their backs as they watch our train go by I can see orchards in the distance and I wonder if thats where Rue would have worked collecting the fruit from the slimmest branches at the tops of the trees Small communities ofshacks  by comparison the houses in the Seam are upscale  spring up here and there but theyre all deserted Every hand must be needed for the harvest On and on it goes I cant believe the size of District  How many people do you think live here Peeta asks I shake my head In school they refer to it as a large district thats all No actual figures on the population But those kids we see on camera waiting for the reaping each year they cant be but a sampling of the ones who actually live here What do they do Have preliminary drawings Pick the winners ahead of time and make sure theyre in the crowd How exactly did Rue end up on that stage with nothing but the wind offering to take her place I begin to weary of the vastness the endlessness of this place When Effie comes to tell us to dress I dont object I go to my compartment and let the prep team do my hair and makeup Cinna comes in with apretty orange frock patterned with autumn leaves I think how much Peeta will like the color Effie gets Peeta and me together and goes through the days program one last time In some districts the victors ride through the city while the residents cheer But in   maybe because theres not much of a city to begin with things being so spread out or maybe because they dont want to waste so many people while the harvest is on  the public appearance is confined to the square It takes place before their Justice Building a huge marble structure Once it must have been a thing ofbeauty but time has taken its toll Even on television you can see ivy overtaking the crumbling facade the sag of the roof The square itself is ringed with rundown storefronts most of which are abandoned Wherever the welltodo live in District  its not here Our entire publicperformance will be staged outside on what Effie refers to as the verandah the tiled expanse between the front doors and the stairs thats shaded by a roof supported by columns Peeta and I will be introduced the mayor of  will read a speech in our honor and well respond with a scripted thankyou provided by the Capitol If a victor had any special allies among the dead tributes it is considered good form to add a few personal comments as well I should say something about Rue and Thresh too really but every time I tried to write it at home I ended up with a blank paper staring me in the face Its hard for me to talk about them without getting emotional Fortunately Peeta has a little something worked up and with some slight alterations it can count for both of us At the end of the ceremony well be presented with some sort of plaque and then we can withdraw to the Justice Building where a special dinner willbe served As the train is pulling into the District  station Cinna puts the finishing touches on my outfit switching my orange hairband for one of metallic gold and securing the mockingjay pin I wore in the arena to my dress Theres no welcoming committee on the platform just a squad of eight Peacekeepers who direct us into the back of an armored truck Effie sniffs as the door clanks closed behind us Really youd think we were all criminals she says Not all of us Effie Just me I think The truck lets us out at the back of the Justice Building Were hurried inside I can smell an excellent meal being prepared but it doesnt block out the odors of mildew and rot Theyve left us no time to look around As we make a beeline for the front entrance I can hear the anthem beginning outside in the square Someone clips a microphone on me Peeta takes my left hand The mayors introducing us as the massive doors open with agroan Big smiles Effie says and gives us a nudge Our feet start moving forward This is it This is where I have to convince everybody how in love I am with Peeta I think The solemn ceremony is pretty tightly mapped out so Im not sure how to do it Its not a time for kissing but maybe I can work one in Theres loud applause but none of the other responses we got in the Capitol the cheers and whoops and whistles We walk across the shaded verandah until the roof runs out and were standing at the top of a big flight of marble stairs in the glaring sun As my eyes adjust I see the buildings on the square have been hung with banners that help cover up their neglected state Its packed with people but again just a fraction of the number who live here As usual aspecial platform has been constructed at the bottom ofthe stage for the families of the dead tributes On Threshs side theres only an old woman with a hunched back and a tall muscular girl Im guessing is his sister On Rues  Im not prepared for Rues family Her parents whose faces are still fresh with sorrow Her five younger siblings who resemble her so closely The slight builds the luminous brown eyes They form a flock of small dark birds The applause dies out and the mayor gives the speech in our honor Two little girls come up with tremendous bouquets of flowers Peeta does his part of the scripted reply and then I find my lips moving to conclude it Fortunately my mother and Prim have drilled me so I can do it in my sleep Peeta had his personal comments written on a card but he doesnt pull it out Instead he speaks in his simple winning style about Thresh and Rue making it to the final eight about how they both kept me alivethereby keeping him aliveandabout how this is a debt we can never repay And then he hesitates before adding something that wasnt written on the card Maybe because he thought Effie might make him remove it It can in no way replace your losses but as a token of our thanks wed like for each of the tributes families from District Eleven to receive one month of our winnings every year for the duration of our lives The crowd cant help but respond with gasps and murmurs There is no precedent for what Peeta has done I dont even know if its legal He probably doesnt know either so he didnt ask in case it isnt As for the families they just stare at us in shock Their lives were changed forever when Thresh and Rue were lost but this gift will change them again A month of tribute winnings can easily provide for a family for a year As long as we live they will not hunger I look at Peeta and he gives me a sad smile I hear Haymitchs voice You could do a lotworse At this moment its impossible to imagine how I could do any better The gift  it is perfect So when I rise up on tiptoe to kiss him it doesnt seem forced at all The mayor steps forward and presents us each with a plaque thats so large I have to put down my bouquet to hold it The ceremonys about to end when I notice one of Rues sisters staring at me She must be about nine and is almost an exact replica of Rue down to the way she stands with her arms slightly extended Despite the good news about the winnings shes not happy In fact her look is reproachful Is it because I didnt save Rue No Its because I still havent thanked her I think A wave of shame rushes through me The girl is right How can I stand here passive and mute leaving all the words to Peeta If she had won Rue would never have let my death go unsung I remember how I took care in the arena to cover her with flowers to make sure her loss did not gounnoticed But that gesture will mean nothing if I dontsupport it now Wait I stumble forward pressing the plaque to my chest My allotted time for speaking has come and gone but I must say something I owe too much And even if I had pledged all my winnings to the families it would not excuse my silence today Wait please I dont know how to start but once I do the words rush from my lips as if theyve been forming in the back of my mind for a long time I want to give my thanks to the tributes of District Eleven I say I look at the pair of women on Threshs side I only ever spoke to Thresh one time Just long enough for him to spare my life I didnt know him but I always respected him For his power For his refusal to play the Games on anyones terms but his own The Careers wanted him to team up with them from the beginning but he wouldnt do it I respectedhim for that For the first time the old hunched woman  is she Threshs grandmother  raises her head and the trace of a smile plays on her lips The crowd has fallen silent now so silent that I wonder how they manage it They must all be holding their breath I turn to Rues family But I feel as if I did know Rue and shell always be with me Everything beautiful brings her to mind I see her in the yellow flowers that grow in the Meadow by my house I see her in the mockingjays that sing in the trees But most of all I see her in my sister Prim My voice is undependable but I am almost finished Thank you for your children I raise my chin to address the crowd And thank you all for the bread I stand there feeling broken and small thousands of eyes trained on me Theres a long pause Then from somewhere in the crowd someone whistles Rues four note mockingjay tune The one that signaled the end of the workday in theorchards The one that meant safety in the arena By the end of the tune I have found the whistler a wizened old man in a faded red shirt and overalls His eyes meet mine What happens next is not an accident It is too well executed to be spontaneous because it happens in complete unison Every person in the crowd presses the three middle fingers of their left hand against their lips and extends them to me Its our sign from District  the last goodbye I gave Rue in the arena If I hadnt spoken to President Snow this gesture might move me to tears But with his recent orders to calm the districts fresh in my ears it fills me with dread What will he think of this very public salute to the girl who defied the Capitol The full impact of what Ive done hits me It was not intentionalI only meant to express my thanks  but I have elicited something dangerous An act of dissent from the people of District  This is exactly the kind of thing I amsupposed to be defusing I try to think of something to say to undermine what has just happened to negate it but I can hear the slight burst of static indicating my microphone has been cut off andthe mayor has taken over Peeta and I acknowledge a final round of applause He leads me back toward the doors unaware that anything has gone wrong I feel funny and have to stop for a moment Little bits of bright sunshine dance before my eyes Are you all right Peeta asks Just dizzy The sun was so bright I say I see his bouquet I forgot my flowers I mumble Ill get them he says I can I answer We would be safe inside the Justice Building by now if I hadnt stopped if I hadnt left my flowers Instead from the deep shade of the verandah we see the whole thing A pair of Peacekeepers dragging the old man who whistled to the topof the steps Forcing him to his knees before the crowd And putting a bullet through his head The man has only just crumpled to the ground when a wall of white Peacekeeper uniforms blocks our view Several of the soldiers have automatic weapons held lengthwise as they push us back toward the door Were going says Peeta shoving the Peacekeeper whos pressing on me We get it all right Come on Katniss His arm encircles me and guides me back into the Justice Building The Peacekeepers follow a pace or two behind us The moment were inside the doors slam shut and we hear the Peacekeepers boots moving back toward the crowd Haymitch Effie Portia and Cinna wait under a staticfilled screen thats mounted on the wall their faces tight with anxiety What happened Effie hurries over We lost the feed just after Katnisss beautiful speech and then Haymitch said he thought he heard a gun fire and I said it wasridiculous but who knows There are lunatics everywhere Nothing happened Effie An old truck backfired says Peeta evenly Two more shots The door doesnt muffle their sound much Who was that Threshs grandmother One of Rues little sistersBoth of you With me says Haymitch Peeta and I follow him leaving the others behind The Peacekeepers who are stationed around the Justice Building take little interest in our movements now that we are safely inside We ascend a magnificent curved marble staircase At the top theres a long hall with worn carpet on the floor Double doors stand open welcoming us into the first room we encounter The ceiling must be twenty feet high Designs of fruit and flowers are carved into the molding and small fat children with wings look down at us from every angle Vases of blossomsgive off a cloying scent that makes my eyes itch Our evening clothes hang on racks against the wall This room has been prepared for our use but were barely there long enough to drop off our gifts Then Haymitch yanks the microphones from our chests stuffs them beneath a couch cushion and waves us on As far as I know Haymitch has only been here once when he was on his Victory Tour decades ago But he must have a remarkable memory or reliable instincts because he leads us up through a maze of twisting staircases and increasingly narrow halls At times he has to stop and force a door By the protesting squeak of the hinges you can tell its been a long time since it was opened Eventually we climb a ladder to a trapdoor When Haymitch pushes it aside we find ourselves in the dome of the Justice Building Its a huge place filled with broken furniture piles of books and ledgers and rusty weapons The coat of dustblanketing everything is so thick its clear it hasnt been disturbed for years Light struggles to filter in through four grimy square windows set in the sides of the dome Haymitch kicks the trapdoor shut and turns on us What happened he asks Peeta relates all that occurred in the square The whistle the salute our hesitation on the verandah the murder of the old man Whats going on Haymitch It will be better coming from you Haymitch says to me I dont agree I think it will be a hundred times worse coming from me But I tell Peeta everything as calmly as I can About President Snow the unrest in the districts I dont even omit the kiss with Gale I lay out how we are all in jeopardy how the whole country is in jeopardy because of my trick with the berries I was supposed to fix things on this tour Make everyone who had doubted believe I acted out of love Calm things down But obviously all Ive donetoday is get three people killed and now everyone in the square will be punished I feel so sick that I have to sit down on a couch despite the exposed springs and stuffing Then I made things worse too By giving the money says Peeta Suddenly he strikes out at a lamp that sits precariously on a crate and knocks it across the room where it shatters against the floor This has to stop Right now This  thisgame you two play where you tell each other secrets but keep them from me like Imtoo inconsequential or stupid or weak to handle them Its not like that Peeta I begin Its exactly like that he yells at me I have people I care about too Katniss Family and friends back in District Twelve who will be just as dead as yours if we dont pull this thing off So after all we went through in the arena dont I even rate the truth from youYoure always so reliably good Peeta says Haymitch So smart about how you present yourself before the cameras I didnt want to disrupt that Well you overestimated me Because I really screwed up today What do you think is going to happen to Rues and Threshs families Do you think theyll get their share of our winnings Do you think I gave them a bright future Because I think theyll be lucky if they survive the day Peeta sends something else flying a statue Ive never seen him like this Hes right Haymitch I say We were wrong not to tell him Even back in the Capitol Even in the arena you two had some sort of system worked out didnt you asks Peeta His voice is quieter now Something I wasnt part of No Not officially I just could tell what Haymitch wanted me to do by what he sent or didnt send I say Well I never had that opportunity Because he never sent me anything until youshowed up says Peeta I havent thought much about this How it must have looked from Peetas perspective when I appeared in the arena having received burn medicine and bread when he who was at deaths door had gotten nothing Like Haymitch was keeping me alive at his expense Look boy Haymitch begins Dont bother Haymitch I know you had to choose one of us And Id have wanted it to be her But this is something different People are dead out there More will follow unless were very good We all know Im better than Katniss in front of the cameras No one needs to coach me on what to say But I have to know what Im walking into says Peeta From now on youll be fully informed Haymitch promises I better be says Peeta He doesnt even bother to look at me before he leaves The dust he disrupted billows up and looks for new places to land My hair my eyes my shiny gold pin Did you choose meHaymitch I ask Yeah he says Why You like him better I say Thats true But remember until they changed the rules I could only hope to get one of you out of there alive he says I thought since he was determined to protect you well between the three of us we might be able to bring you home Oh is all I can think to say Youll see the choices youll have to make If we survive this says Haymitch Youll learn Well Ive learned one thing today This place is not a larger version of District  Our fence is unguarded and rarely charged Our Peacekeepers are unwelcome but less brutal Our hardships evoke more fatigue than fury Here in  they suffermore acutely and feel more desperation President Snow is right A spark could be enough to set them ablaze Everything is happening too fast for me to process it Thewarning the shootings the recognition that I may have set something of great consequence in motion The whole thing is so improbable And it would be one thing if I had planned to stir things up but given the circumstances  how on earth did I cause so much trouble Come on Weve got a dinner to attend says Haymitch I stand in the shower as long as they let me before I have to come out to be readied The prep team seems oblivious to the events of the day Theyre all excited about the dinner In the districts theyre important enough to attend whereas back in the Capitol they almost never score invitations to prestigious parties While they try to predict what dishes will be served I keep seeing the old mans head being blown off I dont even pay attention to what anyone is doing to me until Im about to leave and I see myself in the mirror A pale pink strapless dress brushes my shoes My hair is pinned back from myface and falling down my back in a shower of ringlets Cinna comes up behind me and arranges a shimmering silver wrap around my shoulders He catches my eye in the mirror Like it Its beautiful As always I say Lets see how it looks with a smile he says gently Its his reminder that in a minute there will be cameras again I manage to raise the corners of my lips There we go When we all assemble to go down to the dinner I can see Effie is out of sorts Surely Haymitch hasnt told her about what happened in the square I wouldnt be surprised if Cinna and Portia know but there seems to be an unspoken agreement to leave Effie out of the badnews loop It doesnt take long to hear about the problem though Effie runs through the evenings schedule then tosses it aside And then thank goodness we can all get on that train and get out of here she says Is something wrong Effie asks Cinna I dont like the way weve beentreated Being stuffed into trucks and barred from the platform And then about an hour ago I decided to look around the Justice Building Im something of an expert in architectural design you know she says Oh yes Ive heard that says Portia before the pause gets too long So I was just having a peek around because district ruins are going to be all the rage this year when two Peacemakers showed up and ordered me back to our quarters One of them actually poked me with her gun says Effie I cant help thinking this is the direct result of Haymitch Peeta and me disappearing earlier in the day Its a little reassuring actually to think that Haymitch might have been right That no one would have been monitoring the dusty dome where we talked Although I bet they are now Effie looks so distressed that I spontaneously give her a hug Thats awful EffieMaybe we shouldnt go to the dinner at all At least until theyve apologized I know shell never agree to this but she brightens considerably at the suggestion at the validation of her complaint No Ill manage Its part of my job to weather the ups and downs And we cant let you two miss your dinner she says But thank you for the offer Katniss Effie arranges us in formation for our entrance First the prep teams then her the stylists Haymitch Peeta and I of course bring up the rear Somewhere below musicians begin to play As the first wave of our little procession begins down the steps Peeta and I join hands Haymitch says I was wrong to yell at you You were only operating under his instructions says Peeta And it isnt as if I havent kept things from you in the past I remember the shock of hearing Peeta confess his love for me in front of all of Panem Haymitch had known about that and not told meI think I broke a few things myself after that interview Just an urn he says And your hands Theres no point to it anymore though is there Not being straight with each other I say No point says Peeta We stand at the top of the stairs giving Haymitch a fifteenstep lead as Effie directed Was that really the only time you kissed Gale Im so startled I answer Yes With all that has happened today has that question actually been preying on him Thats fifteen Lets do it he says A light hits us and I put on the most dazzling smile I can We descend the steps and are sucked into what becomes an indistinguishable round of dinners ceremonies and train rides Each day its the same Wake up Get dressed Ride through cheering crowds Listen to a speech in our honor Give a thankyou speech in return but only the one the Capitol gave us never any personal additions now Sometimes a brief tour aglimpse of the sea in one district towering forests in another ugly factories fields of wheat stinking refineries Dress in evening clothes Attend dinner Train During ceremonies we are solemn and respectful but always linked together by our hands our arms At dinners we are borderline delirious in our love for each other We kiss we dance we get caught trying to sneak away to be alone On the train we are quietly miserable as we try to assess what effect we might be having Even without our personal speeches to trigger dissent needless to say the ones we gave in District  were edited out before the event was broadcastyou can feel something in the air the rolling boil of a pot about to run over Not everywhere Some crowds have the wearycattle feel that I know District  usually projects at the victors ceremonies But in others  particularly   and   there is genuine elation in the facesof the people at the sight of us and under the elation fury When they chant my name it is more of a cry for vengeance than a cheer Whenthe Peacekeepers move in to quiet an unruly crowd it presses back instead of retreating And I know that theres nothing I could ever do to change this No show of love however believable will turn this tide If my holding out those berries was an act of temporary insanity then these people will embrace insanity too Cinna begins to take in my clothes around the waist The prep team frets over the circles under my eyes Effie starts giving me pills to sleep but they dont work Not well enough I drift off only to be roused by nightmares that have increased in number and intensity Peeta who spends much of the night roaming the train hears me screaming as I struggle to break out of the haze of drugs that merely prolong the horrible dreams He manages to wake me and calm me down Then he climbs into bed to hold me until I fall back to sleep After that I refuse the pills But every night I let him into my bed We manage the darkness as we did in the arena wrapped in each others arms guarding against dangers that can descend at any moment Nothing else happens but our arrangement quickly becomes a subject of gossip on the train When Effie brings it up to me I think Good Maybe it will get back to President Snow I tell her well make an effort to be more discreet but we dont The backtoback appearances in  and  are their own special kind of awful Cato and Clove the tributes from District  might have both made it home if Peeta and I hadnt I personally killed the girl Glimmer and the boy from District  As I try to avoid looking at hisfamily I learn that his name was Marvel How did I never know that I suppose that before the Games I didnt pay attention and afterward I didnt want to know By the time we reach the Capitol we are desperate We make endless appearances to adoring crowds There is no danger of an uprising here among the privileged among those whose names are never placed in the reaping balls whose children never die for the supposed crimes committed generations ago We dont need to convince anybody in the Capitol of our love but hold to the slim hope that we can still reach some of those we failed to convince in the districts Whatever we do seems too little too late Back in our old quarters in the Training Center Im the one who suggests the public marriage proposal Peeta agrees to do it but then disappears to his room for a long time Haymitch tells me to leave him alone I thought he wanted it anyway I say Notlike this Haymitch says He wanted it to be real I go back to my room and lie under the covers trying not to think of Gale and thinking of nothing else That night on the stage before the Training Center we bubble our way through a list of questions Caesar Flickerman in his twinkling midnight blue suit his hair eyelids and lips still dyed powder blue flawlessly guides us through the interview When he asks us about the future Peeta gets down on one knee pours out his heart and begs me to marry him I of course accept Caesar is beside himself the Capitol audience is hysterical shots of crowds around Panem show a country besotted with happiness President Snow himself makes a surprise visit to congratulate us He clasps Peetas hand and gives him an approving slap on the shoulder He embraces me enfolding me in the smell of blood and roses and plants a puffy kiss on my cheek When he pulls back his fingersdigging into my arms his face smiling into mine I dare to raise my eyebrows They ask what my lips cant Did I do it Was it enough Was giving everything over toyou keeping up the game promising to marry Peeta enough In answer he gives an almost imperceptible shake of his head In that one slight motion I see the end of hope the beginning of the destruction of everything I hold dear in the world I cant guess what form my punishment will take how wide the net will be cast but when it is finished there will most likely be nothing left So you would think that at this moment I would be in utter despair Heres whats strange The main thing I feel is a sense of relief That I can give up this game That the question of whether I can succeed in this venture has been answered even if that answer is a resounding no That if desperate times call fordesperate measures then I am free to act as desperately as I wish Only not here not quite yet Its essential to get back to District  because the main part of any plan will include my mother and sister Gale and his family And Peeta if I can get him to come with us I add Haymitch to the list These are the people I must take with me when I escape into the wild How I will convince them where we will go in the dead of winter what it will take to evade capture are unanswered questions But at least now I know what I must do So instead of crumpling to the ground and weeping I find myself standing up straighter and with more confidence than I have in weeks My smile while somewhat insane is not forced And when President Snow silences the audience and says What do you think about us throwing them a wedding right here in the Capitol I pull off girlalmostcatatonicwithjoy without a hitch CaesarFlickerman asks if the president has a date in mind Oh before we set a date we better clear it with Katnisss mother says the president The audience gives a big laugh and the president puts his arm around me Maybe if the whole country puts its mind to it we can get you married before youre thirty Youll probably have to pass a new law I say with a giggle If thats what it takes says the president with conspiratorial good humor Oh the fun we two have together The party held in the banquet room of President Snows mansion has no equal The fortyfoot ceiling has been transformed into the night sky and the stars look exactly as they do at home I suppose they look the same from the Capitol but who would know Theres always too much light from the city to see the stars here About halfway between the floor and the ceiling musicians float on what look like fluffy white clouds but I cant see what holdsthem aloft Traditional dining tables have been replaced by innumerable stuffed sofas and chairs some surrounding fireplaces others beside fragrant flower gardens or ponds filled with exotic fish so that people can eat and drink and do whatever they please in the utmost comfort Theres a large tiled area in the center of the room that serves as everything from a dance floor to a stagefor the performers who come and go to another spot to mingle with the flamboyantly dressed guests But the real star of the evening is the food Tables laden with delicacies line the walls Everything you can think of and things you have never dreamed of lie in wait Whole roasted cows and pigs and goats still turning on spits Huge platters of fowl stuffed with savory fruits and nuts Ocean creatures drizzled in sauces or begging to be dipped in spicy concoctionsCountless cheeses breads vegetables sweets waterfalls of wine and streams of spirits that flicker with flames My appetite has returned with my desire to fight back After weeks of feeling too worried to eat Im famished I want to taste everything in the room I tell Peeta I can see him trying to read my expression to figure out my transformation Since he doesnt know that President Snow thinks I have failed he can only assume that I think we have succeeded Perhaps even that I have some genuine happiness at our engagement His eyes reflect his puzzlement but only briefly because were on camera Then youd better pace yourself he says Okay no more than one bite of each dish I say My resolve is almost immediately broken at the first table which has twenty or so soups when I encounter a creamy pumpkin brew sprinkled with slivered nuts and tiny black seeds I could just eat this all night Iexclaim But I dont I weaken again at a clear green broth that I can only describe as tasting like springtime and again when I try a frothy pink soup dotted with raspberries Faces appear names are exchanged pictures taken kisses brushed on cheeks Apparently my mockingjay pin has spawned a new fashion sensation because several people come up to show me their accessories My bird has been replicated on belt buckles embroidered into silk lapels even tattooed in intimate places Everyone wants to wear the winners token I can only imagine how nuts that makes President Snow But what can he do The Games were such a hit here where the berries were only a symbol of a desperate girl trying to save her lover Peeta and I make no effort to find company but are constantly sought out We are what no one wants to miss at the party I act delighted but I have zero interest in these Capitol people They are onlydistractions from the food Every table presents new temptations and even on my restricted onetasteperdish regimen I begin filling up quickly I pick up a small roasted bird bite into it and my tongue floods with orange sauce Delicious But I make Peeta eat the remainder because I want to keep tasting things and the idea of throwing away food as I see so many people doing so casually is abhorrent to me After about ten tables Im stuffed and weve only sampled a small number of the dishes available Just then my prep team descends on us Theyre nearly incoherent between the alcohol theyve consumed and their ecstasy atbeing at such a grand affair Why arent you eating asks Octavia I have been but I cant hold another bite I say They all laugh as if thats the silliest thing theyve ever heard No one lets that stop them says Flavius They leadus over to a table that holds tiny stemmed wineglasses filled with clear liquid Drink this Peeta picks one up to take a sip and they lose it Not here shrieks Octavia You have to do it in there says Venia pointing to doors that lead to the toilets Or youll get it all over the floor Peeta looks at the glass again and puts it together You mean this will make me puke My prep team laughs hysterically Of course so you can keep eating says Octavia Ive been in there twice already Everyone does it or else how would you have any fun at a feast Im speechless staring at the pretty little glasses and all they imply Peeta sets his back on the table with such precision youd think it might detonate Come on Katniss lets dance Music filters down from the clouds as he leads me away from the team the table and out onto the floor We know only a few dances at home the kind that go with fiddle and flute music and require a good deal of spaceBut Effie has shown us some that are popular in the Capitol The musics slow and dreamlike so Peeta pulls me into his arms and we move in a circle with practically no steps at all You could do this dance on a pie plate Were quiet for a while Then Peeta speaks in a strained voice You go along thinking you can deal with it thinking maybe theyre not so bad and then you He cuts himself off All I can think of is the emaciated bodies of the children on our kitchen table as my mother prescribes what the parents cant give More food Now that were rich shell send some home with them But often in the old days there was nothing to give and the child was past saving anyway And here in the Capitol theyre vomiting for the pleasure of filling their bellies again and again Not from some illness of body or mind not from spoiled food Its what everyone does at a party Expected Part of the fun One day when I dropped byto give Hazelle the game Vick was home sick with a bad cough Being part of Gales family the kid has to eat better than ninety percent of the rest of District  But he still spent about fifteen minutes talking about how theyd opened a can of corn syrup from Parcel Day and each had a spoonful on bread and were going to maybe have more later in the week How Hazelle had said he could have a bit in a cup of tea to soothe his cough but he wouldnt feel right unless the others had some too If its like that at Gales whats it like in the other houses Peeta they bring us here to fight to the death for their entertainment I say Really this is nothing by comparison I know I know that Its just sometimes I cant stand it anymore To the point where  Imnot sure what Ill do He pauses then whispers Maybe we were wrong Katniss About what I ask Abouttrying to subdue things in the districts he says My head turns swiftly from side to side but no one seems to have heard The camera crew got sidetracked at a table of shellfish and the couples dancing around us are either too drunk or too selfinvolved to notice Sorry he says He should be This is no place to be voicing such thoughts Save it for home I tell himJust then Portia appears with a large man who looks vaguely familiar She introduces him as Plutarch Heavensbee the new Head Gamemaker Plutarch asks Peeta if he can steal me for a dance Peetas recovered his camera face and goodnaturedly passes me over warning the man not to get too attached I dont want to dance with Plutarch Heavensbee I dont want to feel his hands one resting against mine one on my hip Im not used to being touchedexcept by Peeta or my family and I rank Gamemakers somewhere below maggots in terms of creatures I want in contact with my skin But he seems to sense this and holds me almost at arms length as we turn on the floor We chitchat about the party about the entertainment about the food and then he makes a joke about avoiding punch since training I dont get it and then I realize hes the man who tripped backward into the punch bowl when I shot an arrow at the Gamemakers during the training session Well not really I was shooting an apple out of their roast pigs mouth But I made them jump Oh youre one who I laugh remembering him splashing back into the punch bowl Yes And youll be pleased to know Ive never recovered says Plutarch I want to point out that twentytwo dead tributes will never recover from the Games he helped create either But I only say Good So youre the Head Gamemaker thisyear That must be a big honor Between you and me there werent many takers for the job he says So much responsibility as to how the Games turn out Yeah the last guys dead I think He must know about Seneca Crane but he doesnt look the least bit concerned Are you planning the Quarter Quell Games already I say Oh yes Well theyve been in the works for years of course Arenas arent built in a day But the shall we say flavor of the Games is being determined now Believe it or not Ive got a strategy meeting tonight he says Plutarch steps back and pulls out a gold watch on a chain from a vest pocket He flips open the lid sees the time and frowns Ill have to be going soon He turns the watch so I can see the face It starts at midnight That seems late for I say but then something distracts me Plutarch has run his thumb across the crystal face of the watch and for just a moment an image appears glowing as iflit by candlelight Its another mockingjay Exactly like the pin on my dress Only this one disappears He snaps the watch closed Thats very pretty I say Oh its more than pretty Its one of a kind he says If anyone asks about me say Ive gone home to bed The meetings are supposed to be kept secret But I thought itd be safe to tell you Yes Your secrets safe with me I say As we shake hands he gives a small bow a common gesture here in the Capitol Well Ill see you next summer at the Games Katniss Best wishes on your engagement and good luck with your mother Illneed it I say Plutarch disappears and I wander through the crowd looking for Peeta as strangers congratulate me On my engagement on my victory at the Games on my choice of lipstick I respond but really Im thinking about Plutarch showing off his pretty oneofakindwatch to me There was something strange about it Almost clandestine But why Maybe he thinks someone else will steal his idea of putting a disappearing mockingjay on a watch face Yes he probably paid a fortune for it and now he cant show it to anyone because hes afraid someone will make a cheap knockoff version Only in the Capitol I find Peeta admiring a table of elaborately decorated cakes Bakers have come in from the kitchen especially to talk frosting with him and you can see them tripping over one another to answer his questions At his request they assemble an assortment of little cakes for him to take back to District  where he can examine their work in quiet Effie said we have to be on the train at one I wonder what time it is he says glancing around Almost midnight I reply I pluck a chocolate flower from a cake with my fingers and nibble on it so beyond worrying about manners Time tosay thank you and farewell trills Effie at my elbow Its one of those moments when I just love her compulsive punctuality We collect Cinna and Portia and she escorts us around to say goodbye to important people then herds us to the door Shouldnt we thank President Snow asks Peeta Its his house Oh hes not a big one for parties Too busy says Effie Ive already arranged for the necessary notes and gifts to be sent to him tomorrow There you are Effie gives a little wave to two Capitol attendants who have an inebriated Haymitch propped up between them We travel through the streets of the Capitol in a car with darkened windows Behind us another car brings the prep teams The throngs of people celebrating are so thick its slow going But Effie has this all down to a science and at exactly one oclock we are back on the train and its pulling out of the station Haymitch is deposited in his room Cinna orders tea and we all take seatsaround the table while Effie rattles her schedule papers and reminds us were still on tour Theres the Harvest Festival in District Twelve to think about So I suggest we drink our tea and head straight to bed No one argues When I open my eyes its early afternoon My head rests on Peetas arm I dont remember him coming in last night I turn being careful not to disturb him but hes already awake No nightmares he says What I ask You didnt have any nightmares last night he says Hes right For the first time in ages Ive slept through the night I had a dream though I say thinking back I was following a mockingjay through the woods For a long time It was Rue really I mean when it sang it had her voice Where did shetake you he says brushing my hair off my forehead I dont know We never arrived I say But I felt happyWell you slept like you were happy he says Peeta how come I never know when youre having a nightmare I say I dont know I dont think I cry out or thrash around or anything I just come to paralyzed with terror he says You should wake me I say thinking about how I can interrupt his sleep two or three times on a bad night About how long it can take to calm me down Its not necessary My nightmares are usually about losing you he says Im okay once I realize youre here Ugh Peeta makes comments like this in such an offhand way and its like being hit in the gut Hes only answering my question honestly Hes not pressing me to reply in kind to make any declaration of love But I still feel awful as if Ive been using him in some terrible way Have I I dont know I only know that for the first time I feel immoral about him being here in my bed Which is ironic since were officially engaged nowBe worse when were home and Im sleeping alone again he says Thats right were almost home The agenda for District  includes a dinner at Mayor Undersees house tonight and a victory rally in the square during the Harvest Festival tomorrow We always celebrate the Harvest Festival on the final day of the Victory Tour but usually it means a meal at home or with a few friends if you can afford it This year it will be a public affair and since the Capitol will be throwing it everyone in the whole district will have full bellies Most of our prepping will take place at the mayors house since were back to being covered in furs for outdoor appearances Were only at the train station briefly to smile and wave as we pile into our car We dont even get to see our families until the dinner tonight Im glad it will be at the mayors house instead of at the Justice Building where the memorial for my father was held where they took me afterthe reaping for those wrenching goodbyes to my family The Justice Building is too full of sadness But I like Mayor Undersees house especially now that his daughter Madge and I are friends We always were in a way It became official when she came to say goodbye to me before I left for the Games When she gave me the mockingjay pin for luck After I got home we started spending time together It turns out Madge has plenty of empty hours to fill too It was a little awkward at first because we didnt know what to do Other girls our age Ive heard them talking about boys or other girls or clothes Madge and I arent gossipy and clothes bore me to tears But after a few false starts I realized she was dying to go into the woods so Ive taken her a couple of times and showed her how to shoot Shes trying to teach me the piano but mostly I like to listen to her play Sometimes we eat at each others houses Madgelikes mine better Her parents seem nice but I dont think she sees a whole lot of them Her father has District  to run and her mother gets fierce headaches that force her to stay in bed for days Maybe you should take her to the Capitol I said during one of them We werent playing the piano that day because even two floors away the sound caused her mother pain They can fix her up I bet Yes But you dont go to the Capitol unless they invite you said Madge unhappily Even the mayors privileges are limited When we reach the mayors house I only have time to give Madge a quick hug before Effie hustles me off to the third floor to get ready After Im prepped and dressed in a fulllength silver gown Ive still got an hour to kill before the dinner so I slip off to find her Madges bedroom is on the second floor along with several guest rooms and her fathers study I stick my head in the study to say hello to the mayorbut its empty The televisions droning on and I stop to watch shots of Peeta and me at the Capitol party last night Dancing eating kissing This will be playing in every household in Panem right now The audience must be sick to death of the starcrossed lovers from District  I know I am Im leaving the room when a beeping noise catches my attention I turn back to see the screen of the television go black Then the words UPDATE ON DISTRICT  start flashing Instinctively I know this is not for my eyes but something intended only for the mayor I should go Quickly Instead I find myself stepping closer to the television An announcer Ive never seen before appears Its a woman with graying hair and a hoarse authoritative voice She warns that conditions are worsening and a Level  alert has been called Additional forces are being sent into District  and all textile production has ceased They cut away fromthe woman to the main square in District  I recognize it because I was there only last week There are still banners with my face waving from the rooftops Below them theres a mob scene The squares packed with screaming people their faces hidden with rags and homemade masks throwing bricks Buildings burn Peacekeepers shoot into the crowd killing at random Ive never seen anything like it but I can only be witnessing one thing This is what President Snow calls an uprising A leather bag filled with food and a flask of hot tea A pair of furlined gloves that Cinna left behind Three twigs broken from the naked trees lying in the snow pointing in the direction I will travel This is what I leave for Gale at our usual meeting place on the first Sunday after the Harvest Festival I have continued on through the cold misty woods breaking a path that will be unfamiliar to Gale but is simple for my feet to find It leads to the lake I nolonger trust that our regular rendezvous spot offers privacy and Ill need that and more to spill my guts to Galetoday But will he even come If he doesnt Ill have no choice but to risk going to his house in the dead of night There are things he has to know things I need him to help me figure out Once the implications of what I was seeing on Mayor Undersees television hit me I made for the door and started down the hall Just in time too because themayor came up the steps moments later I gave him a wave Looking for Madge he said in a friendly tone Yes I want to show her my dress I said Well you know where to find her Just then another round of beeping came from his study His face turned grave Excuse me he said He went into his study and closed the door tightly I waited in the halluntil I had composed myself Reminded myself I must act naturally Then I found Madge in her room sitting at her dressing table brushing out her wavy blond hair before a mirror She was in the same pretty white dress shed worn on reaping day She saw my reflection behind her and smiled Look at you Like you came right off the streets of the Capitol I stepped in closer My fingers touched the mockingjay Even my pin now Mockingjays are all the rage in the Capitol thanks to you Are you sure you dont want it back I asked Dont be silly it was a gift said Madge She tied back her hair in a festive gold ribbon Where did you get it anyway I asked It was my aunts she said But I think its been in the family a long time Its a funny choice a mockingjay I said I mean because of what happened in the rebellion With the jabberjays backfiring on the Capitol and all The jabberjays were muttations geneticallyenhanced male birds created by the Capitol as weapons to spy on rebels in the districts They could remember and repeat long passages of human speech so they were sent into rebel areas to capture our words and return them to the Capitol The rebels caught on and turned them against the Capitol by sending them home loaded with lies When this was discovered the jabberjays were left to die In a few years they became extinct in the wild but not before they had mated with female mockingbirds creating an entirely new species But mockingjays were never a weapon said Madge Theyre just songbirds Right Yeah I guess so I said But its not true A mockingbird is just a songbird A mockingjay is a creature the Capitol never intended to exist They hadnt counted on the highly controlled jabberjay having the brains to adapt to the wild to pass on its genetic code to thrive in a new form Theyhadnt anticipated its will to live Now as I trudge through the snow I see the mockingjays hopping about on branches as they pick up on other birds melodies replicate them and then transform them into something new As always they remind me of Rue I think of the dream I had the last night on the train where I followed her in mockingjay form I wish I could have stayed asleep just a bit longer and found out where she was trying to take me Its a hike to the lake no question If he decides to follow me at all Gales going to be put out by this excessive use of energy that could be better spent in hunting He was conspicuously absent from the dinner at the mayors house although the rest of his family cameHazelle said he was home sick which was an obvious lie I couldnt find him at the Harvest Festival either Vicktold me he was out hunting That was probably true After a couple of hours I reach an old house near the edge of the lake Maybe house is too big a word for it Its only one room about twelve feet square My father thought that a long time ago there were a lot of buildings  you can still see some of the foundations  and people came to them to play and fish in the lake This house outlasted the others because its made of concrete Floor roof ceiling Only one of four glass windows remains wavy and yellowed by time Theres no plumbing and no electricity but the fireplace still works and theres a woodpile in the corner that my father and I collected years ago I start a small fire counting on the mist to obscure any telltale smoke While the fire catches I sweep out the snow that has accumulated under the empty windows using a twig broom my father made me when I was about eight and I played house here Then I sit on the tinyconcrete hearth thawing out by the fire and waiting for Gale Its a surprisingly short time before he appears A bow slung over his shoulder a dead wild turkey he must have encountered along the way hanging from his belt He stands in the doorway as if considering whether or not to enter He holds the unopened leather bag of food the flask Cinnas gloves Gifts he will not accept because of his anger at me I know exactly how he feels Didnt I do the same thing to my mother I look in his eyes His temper cant quite mask the hurt the sense of betrayal he feels at my engagement to Peeta This will be my last chance this meeting today to not lose Gale forever I could take hours trying to explain and even then have him refuse me Instead I go straight to the heart of my defense President Snow personally threatened to have you killed I say Gale raises his eyebrows slightly but theres no real show of fear or astonishment Anyoneelse Well he didnt actually give me a copy of the list But its a good guess it includes both our families I say Its enough to bring him to the fire He crouches before the hearth and warms himself Unless what Unless nothing now I say Obviously this requires more of an explanation but I have no idea where to start so I just sit there staring gloomily into the fire After about a minute of this Gale breaks the silence Well thanks for the headsup I turn to him ready to snap but I catch the glint in his eye I hate myself for smiling This is not a funny moment but I guess its a lot to drop on someone Were all going to be obliterated no matter what I do have a plan you know Yeah I bet its a stunner he says He tosses the gloves on my lap Here I dont want your fianc s old gloves Hes not my fianc  Thats just part of the act And these arent his gloves They were CinnasI say Give them back then he says He pulls on the gloves flexes his fingers and nods in approval At least Ill die in comfort Thats optimistic Of course you dont know whats happened I say Lets have it he says I decide to begin with the night Peeta and I were crowned victors of the Hunger Games and Haymitch warned me of the Capitols fury I tell him about the uneasiness that dogged me even once I was back home President Snows visit to my house the murders in District  the tension in the crowds the lastditch effort of the engagement the presidents indication that it hadnt been enough my certainty that Ill have to pay Gale never interrupts While I talk he tucks the gloves in his pocket and occupies himself with turning the food in the leather bag into a meal for us Toasting bread and cheese coring apples placing chestnuts in the fire to roast I watch his hands his beautiful capable fingers Scarred as minewere before the Capitol erased all marks from my skin but strong and deft Hands that have the power to mine coal but the precision to set a delicate snare Hands I trust I pause to take a drink of tea from the flask before I tell him about my homecoming Well you really made a mess of things he says Im not even done I tell him Ive heard enough for the moment Lets skip ahead to this plan of yours he says I take a deep breath We run away What he asks This has actually caught him off guard We take to the woods and make a run for it I say His face is impossible to read Will he laugh at me dismiss this as foolishness I rise in agitation preparing for an argument You said yourself you thought that we could do it That morning of the reaping You said He steps in and I feel myself lifted off the ground The room spins and I have to lock my arms around Gales neck to brace myself Hes laughing happy Hey Iprotest but Im laughing too Gale sets me down but doesnt release his hold on me Okay lets run away he says Really You dont think Im mad Youll go with me Some of the crushing weight begins to lift as it transfers to Gales shoulders I do think youre mad and Ill still go with you he says He means it Not only means it but welcomes it We can do it I know we can Lets get out of here and never come back Youre sure I say Because its going to be hard with the kids and all I dont want to get five miles into the woods and have you Im sure Im completely entirely one hundred percent sure He tilts his forehead down to rest against mine and pulls me closer His skin his whole being radiates heat from being so near the fire and I close my eyes soaking in his warmth I breathe in the smell of snowdampened leather and smoke and apples the smell of all those wintry days we shared before the Games I dontry to move away Why should I anyway His voicedrops to a whisper I love you Thats why I never see these things coming They happen too fast One second youre proposing an escape plan and the next youre expected to deal with something like this I come up with what must be the worst possible response I know It sounds terrible Like I assume he couldnt help loving me but that I dont feel anything in return Gale starts to draw away but I grab hold of him I know And you you know what you are to me Its not enough He breaks my grip Gale I cant think about anyone that way now All I can think about every day every waking minute since they drew Prims name at the reaping is how afraid I am And there doesnt seem to be room for anything else If we could get somewhere safe maybe I could be different I dont know Ican see him swallowing his disappointment So well go Well find out He turns back to the fire where the chestnuts are beginning to burn He flips them out onto the hearth My mothers going to take some convincing I guess hes still going anyway But the happiness has fled leaving an alltoofamiliar strain in its place Mine too Ill just have to make her see reason Take her for a long walk Make sure she understands we wont survive the alternative Shell understand I watched a lot of the Games with her and Prim She wont say no to you says Gale I hope not The temperature in the house seems to have dropped twenty degrees in a matter of seconds Haymitch will be the real challenge Haymitch Gale abandons the chestnuts Youre not asking him to come with us I have to Gale I cant leave him and Peeta because theyd His scowl cuts me off What Im sorry I didnt realize how large our partywas he snaps at me Theyd torture them to death trying to find out where I was I say What about Peetas family Theyll never come In fact they probably couldnt wait to inform on us Which Im sure hes smart enough to realize What if he decides to stay he asks I try to sound indifferent but my voice cracks Then he stays Youd leave him behind Gale asks To save Prim and my mother yes I answer I mean no Ill get him to come And me would you leave me Gales expression is rock hard now Just if for instance I cant convince my mother to drag three young kids into the wilderness in winter Hazelle wont refuse Shell see sense I say Suppose she doesnt Katniss What then he demands Then you have to force her Gale Do you think Im making this stuff up My voice is rising in anger as well No I dont know Maybe the presidents just manipulating you I mean hes throwingyour wedding You saw how the Capitol crowd reacted I dont think he canafford to kill you Or Peeta Hows he going to get out of that one says Gale Well with an uprising in District Eight I doubt hes spending much time choosing my wedding cake I shout The instant the words are out of my mouth I want to reclaim them Their effect on Gale is immediatethe flush on his cheeks the brightness of his gray eyes Theres an uprising in Eight he says in a hushed voice I try to backpedal To defuse him as I tried to defuse the districts I dont know if its really an uprising Theres unrest People in the streets  I say Gale grabs my shoulders What did you see Nothing In person I just heard something As usual its too little too late I give up and tell him I saw something on the mayors television I wasnt supposed to There was acrowd and fires and the Peacekeepers were gunning people down but they were fighting back  I bite my lip and struggle to continue describing the scene Instead I say aloud the words that have been eating me up inside And its my fault Gale Because of what I did in the arena If I had just killed myself with those berries none of this wouldve happened Peeta could have come home and lived and everyone else would have been safe too Safe to do what he says in a gentler tone Starve Work like slaves Send their kids to the reaping You havent hurt peopleyouve given them an opportunity They just have to be brave enough to take it Theres already been talk in the mines People who want to fight Dont you see Its happening Its finally happening If theres an uprising in District Eight why not here Why not everywhere This could be it the thing weve been Stop it You dont know what youre sayingThe Peacekeepers outside of Twelve theyre not like Darius or even Cray The lives of district people  they mean less than nothing to them I say Thats why we have to join the fight he answers harshly No We have to leave here before they kill us and a lot of other people too Im yelling again but I cant understand why hes doing this Why doesnt he see whats so undeniable Gale pushes me roughly away from him You leave then Id never go in a million years You were happy enough to go before I dont see how an uprising in District Eight does anything but make it more important that we leave Youre just mad about No I cant throw Peeta in his face What about your family What about the other families Katniss The ones who cant run away Dont you see It cant be about just saving us anymore Not if the rebellions begun Gale shakes his head not hiding his disgust with me You could do so much Hethrows Cinnas gloves at my feet I changed my mind I dont want anything they made in the Capitol And hes gone I look down at the gloves Anything they made in the Capitol Was that directed at me Does he think I am now just another product of theCapitol and therefore something untouchable The unfairness of it all fills me with rage But its mixed up with fear over what kind of crazy thing he might do next I sink down next to the fire desperate for comfort to work out my next move I calm myself by thinking that rebellions dont happen in a day Gale cant talk to the miners until tomorrow If I can get to Hazelle before then she might straighten him out But I cant go now If hes there hell lock me out Maybe tonight after everyone else is asleep  Hazelle often works late into the night finishing up laundry Icould go then tap at the window tell her the situation so shell keep Gale from doing anything foolish My conversation with President Snow in the study comes back to me My advisors were concerned you would be difficult but youre not planning on being difficult at all are you No Thats what I told them I said any girl who goes to such lengths to preserve her life isnt going to be interested in throwing it away with both hands I think of how hard Hazelle has worked to keep that family alive Surely shell be on my side in this matter Or wont she It must be getting on toward noon now and the days are so short No point in being in the woods after dark if you dont have to I stamp out the remains of my little fire clear up the scraps of food and tuck Cinnas gloves in my belt I guess Ill hang on to them for a while In case Gale has a change of heart I think of the look on his face when he flung them to the ground Howrepelled he was by them by me  I trudge through the woods and reach my old house while theres still light My conversation with Gale was an obvious setback but Im still determined to carry on with my plan to escape District  I decide to find Peeta next In a strange way since hes seen some of what Ive seen on the tour he may be an easier sell than Gale was I run into him as hes leaving the Victors Village Been hunting he asks You can see he doesnt think its a good idea Not really Going to town I ask Yes Im supposed to eat dinner with my family he says Well I can at least walk you in The road from the Victors Village to the square gets little use Its a safe enough place to talk But I cant seem to get the words out Proposing it to Gale was such a disaster I gnaw on my chapped lips The square gets closer with every step I may not have an opportunity again soon I take a deep breath and let the words rush out Peetaif I asked you to run away from the district with me would you Peeta takes my arm bringing me to a stop He doesnt need to check my face to see if Im serious Depends on why youre asking President Snow wasnt convinced by me Theres an uprising in District Eight We have to get out I say By we do you mean just you and me No Who else would be going he asks My family Yours if they want to comeHaymitch maybe I say What about Gale he says I dont know He might have other plans I say Peeta shakes his head and gives me a rueful smile I bet he does Sure Katniss Ill go I feel a slight twinge of hope You will Yeah But I dont think for a minute you will he says I jerk my arm away Then you dont know me Be ready It could be any time I take off walking and he follows a pace or twobehind Katniss Peeta says I dont slow down If he thinks its a bad idea I dont want to know because its the only one I have Katniss hold up I kick a dirty frozen chunk of snow off the path and let him catch up The coal dust makes everything look especially ugly I really will go if you want me to I just think we better talk it through with Haymitch Make sure we wont be making things worse for everyone He raises his head Whats that I lift my chin Ive been so consumed with my own worries I havent noticed the strange noise coming from the square A whistling the sound of an impact the intake of breath from a crowd Come on Peeta says his face suddenly hard I dont know why I cant place the sound even guess at the situation But it means something bad to him When we reach the square its clear somethings happening but the crowds too thick to see Peeta steps up on a crate against the wall ofthe sweetshop and offers me a hand while he scans the square Im halfway up when he suddenly blocks my way Get down Get out of here Hes whispering but his voice is harsh with insistence What I say trying to force my way back up Go home Katniss Ill be there in a minute I swear he says Whatever it is its terrible I yank away from his hand and begin to push my way through the crowd People see me recognize my face and then look panicked Hands shove me back Voices hiss Get out of here girl Only make it worse What do you want to do Get him killed But at this point my heart is beating so fast and fierce I hardly hear them I only know that whatever waits in the middle of the square is meant for me When I finally break through to the cleared space I see I am right And Peeta was right And those voices were right too Gales wrists are bound to a wooden post The wild turkey he shot earlier hangs abovehim the nail driven through its neck His jackets been cast aside on the ground his shirt torn away He slumps unconscious on his knees held up only by the ropes at his wrists What used to be his back is a raw bloody slab of meat Standing behind him is a man Ive never seen but I recognize his uniform Its the one designated for our Head Peacekeeper This isnt old Cray though This is a tall muscular man with sharp creases in his pants The pieces of the picture do not quite come together until I see his arm raise the whip No I cry and spring forward Its too late to stop the armfrom descending and I instinctively know I wont have the power to block it Instead I throw myself directly between the whip and Gale Ive flung out my arms to protect as much of his broken body as possible so theres nothing todeflect the lash I take the full force of it across the left side of my face The pain is blinding and instantaneous Jagged flashes of light cross my vision and I fall to my knees One hand cups my cheek while the other keeps me from tipping over I can already feel the welt rising up the swelling closing my eye The stones beneath me are wet with Gales blood the air heavy with its scent Stop it Youll kill him I shriek I get a glimpse of my assailants face Hard with deep lines a cruel mouth Gray hair shaved almost to nonexistence eyes so black they seem all pupils a long straight nose reddened by the freezing air The powerful arm lifts again his sights set on me My hand flies to my shoulder hungry for an arrow but of course my weapons are stashed in the woods I grit my teeth in anticipation of the next lash Hold it a voice barks Haymitch appears and trips over a Peacekeeper lying on the ground Its Darius A huge purplelump pushes through the red hair on his forehead Hes knocked out but still breathing What happened Did he try to come to Gales aid before I got here Haymitch ignores him and pulls me to my feet roughly Oh excellent His hand locks under my chin lifting it Shes got a photo shoot next week modeling wedding dresses What am I supposed to tell her stylist I see a flicker of recognition in the eyes of the man with the whip Bundled against the cold my face free of makeup my braid tucked carelessly under my coat it wouldnt be easy to identify me as the victor of the last Hunger Games Especially with half my face swelling up But Haymitch has been showing up on television for years and hed be difficult to forget The man rests the whip on his hip She interrupted the punishment of a confessed criminal Everything about this man his commanding voice his odd accent warns of an unknown and dangerous threat Wherehas he come from District   From the Capitol itself I dont care if she blew up the blasted Justice Building Look at her cheek Think that will be camera ready in a week Haymitch snarls The mans voice is still cold but I can detect a slight edge of doubt Thats not my problem No Well its about to be my friend The first call I make when I get home is to the Capitol says HaymitchFind out who authorized you to mess up my victors pretty little face He was poaching What business is it of hers anyway says the man Hes her cousin Peetas got my other arm now but gently And shes my fianc  So if you want to get to him expect to go through both of us Maybe were it The only three people in the district who could make a stand like this Although its sure to be temporary There will be repercussions But at the moment all I care about iskeeping Gale alive The new Head Peacekeeper glances over at his backup squad With relief I see theyre familiar faces old friends from the Hob You can tell by their expressions that theyre not enjoying the show One a woman named Purnia who eats regularly at Greasy Saes steps forward stiffly I believe for a first offense the required number of lashes has been dispensed sir Unless your sentence is death which we would carry out by firing squad Is that the standard protocol here asks the Head Peacekeeper Yes sir Purnia says and several others nod in agreement Im sure none of them actually know because in the Hob the standard protocol for someone showing up with a wild turkey is for everybody to bid on the drumsticks Very well Get your cousin out of here then girl And if he comes to remind him that the next time he poaches off the Capitols land Ill assemble that firing squad personally TheHead Peacekeeper wipes his hand along the length of the whip splattering us with blood Then he coils it into quick neat loops and walks off Most of the other Peacekeepers fall in an awkward formation behind him A small group stays behind and hoists Dariuss body up by the arms and legs I catch Purnias eye and mouth the word Thanks before she goes She doesnt respond but Im sure she understood Gale I turn my hands fumbling at the knots binding his wrists Someone passes forward a knife and Peeta cuts the ropes Gale collapses to the ground Better get him to your mother says Haymitch Theres no stretcher but the old woman at the clothing stall sells us the board that serves as her countertop Just dont tell where you got it she says packing up the rest of her goods quickly Most of the square has emptied fear getting the better of compassion But after what just happened I cantblame anyone By the time weve laid Gale facedown on the board theres only a handful of people left to carry him Haymitch Peeta and a couple of miners who work on the same crew as Gale lift him up Leevy a girl who lives a few houses down from mine in the Seam takes my arm My mother kept her little brother alive last year when he caught the measles Need help getting back Her gray eyes are scared but determined No but can you get Hazelle Send her over I ask Yeah says Leevy turning on her heel Leevy I say Dont let her bring the kids No Ill stay with them myselfshe says Thanks I grab Gales jacket and hurry after the others Get some snow on that Haymitch orders over his shoulder I scoop up a handful of snow and press it against my cheek numbing a bit of the pain My left eyestearing heavily now and in the dimming light its all I can do to follow the boots in front of me As we walk I hear Bristel and Thorn Gales crewmates piece together the story of what happened Gale mustve gone to Crays house as hes done a hundred times knowing Cray always pays well for a wild turkey Instead he found the new Head Peacekeeper a man they heard someone call Romulus Thread No one knows what happened to Cray He was buying white liquor in the Hob just this morning apparently still in command of the district but now hes nowhere to be found Thread put Gale under immediate arrest and of course since he was standing there holding a dead turkey there was little Gale could say in his own defense Word of his predicament spread quickly He was brought to the square forced to plead guilty to his crime and sentenced to a whipping to be carried out immediately By the time I showed up hed beenlashed at least forty times He passed out around thirty Lucky he only had the turkey on him says Bristel If hed had his usual haul wouldve been much worse He told Thread he found it wandering around the Seam Said it got over the fence and hed stabbed it with a stick Still a crime But if theyd known hed been in the woods with weapons theyd have killed him for sure says Thom What about Darius Peeta asks After about twenty lashes he stepped in saying that was enough Only he didnt do it smart and official like Purnia did He grabbed Threads arm and Thread hit him in the head with the butt of the whip Nothing good waiting for him says Bristel Doesnt sound like much good for any of us says Haymitch Snow begins thick and wet making visibility even more difficult I stumble up the walk to my house behind the others using my ears more than my eyes to guide me A golden light colors the snow as the dooropens My mother who was no doubt waiting for me after a long day of unexplained absence takes in the scene New Head Haymitch says and she gives him a curt nod as if no other explanation is needed Im filled with awe as I always am as I watch her transform from a woman who calls me to kill a spider to a woman immune to fear When a sick or dying person is brought to her  this is the only time I think my mother knows who she is In moments the long kitchen table has been cleared a sterile white cloth spread across it and Gale hoisted onto it My mother pours water from a kettle into a basin while ordering Prim to pull a series of her remedies from the medicine cabinet Dried herbs and tinctures and storebought bottles I watch her hands the long tapered fingers crumbling this adding drops of that into the basin Soaking acloth in the hot liquid as she gives Prim instructions to prepare a second brew My mother glances my way Did it cut your eye No its just swelled shut I say Get more snow on it she instructs But I am clearly not a priority Can you save him I ask my mother She says nothing as she wrings out the cloth and holds it in the air to cool somewhat Dont worry says Haymitch Used to be a lot of whipping before Cray Shes the one we took them to I cant remember a time before Cray a time when there was a Head Peacekeeper who used the whip freely But my mother must have been around my age and still working at the apothecary shop with her parents Even back then she must have had healers hands Ever so gently she begins to clean the mutilated flesh on Gales back I feel sick to my stomach useless the remaining snow dripping from my glove into a puddle on the floor Peeta puts me in a chair and holds acloth filled with fresh snow to my cheek Haymitch tells Bristel and Thorn to get home and I see him press coins into their hands before they leave Dont know what will happen with your crew he says They nod and accept the money Hazelle arrives breathless and flushed fresh snow in her hair Wordlessly she sits on a stool next to the table takes Gales hand and holds it against her lips My mother doesnt acknowledge even her Shes gone into that special zone that includes only herself and the patient and occasionally Prim The rest of us can wait Even in her expert hands it takes a long time to clean the wounds arrange what shredded skin can be saved apply a salve and a light bandage As the blood clears I can see where every stroke of the lash landed and feel it resonate in the single cut on my face I multiply my own pain once twice forty times and can only hope that Gale remains unconscious Of course thatstoo much to ask for As the final bandages are being placed a moan escapes his lips Hazelle strokes his hair and whispers something while my mother and Prim go through their meager store of painkillers the kind usually accessible only to doctors They are hard to come by expensive and always in demand My mother has to save the strongest for the worst pain but what is the worst pain To me its always the pain that is present If I were in charge those painkillers would be gone in a day because I have so little ability to watch suffering My mother tries to save them for those who are actually in the process of dying to ease them out of the world Since Gale is regaining consciousness they decide on an herbal concoction he can take by mouth That wont be enough I say They stare at me That wont be enough I know how it feels That will barely knock out a headache Well combine it with sleep syrup Katniss and hell manageit The herbs are more for the inflammation my mother begins calmly Just give him the medicine I scream at herGive it to him Who are you anyway to decide how much pain he can stand Gale begins stirring at my voice trying to reach me The movement causes fresh blood to stain his bandages and an agonized sound to come from his mouth Take her out says my mother Haymitch and Peeta literally carry me from the room while I shout obscenities at her They pin me down on a bed in one of the extra bedrooms until I stop fighting While I lie there sobbing tears trying to squeeze out of the slit of my eye I hear Peeta whisper to Haymitch about President Snow about the uprising in District  She wants us all to run he says but if Haymitch has an opinion on this he doesnt offer it After a while my mother comes in and treats my face Then sheholds my hand stroking my arm while Haymitch fills her in on what happened with Gale So its starting again she says Like before By the looks of it he answers Whod have thought wed ever be sorry to see old Cray go Cray would have been disliked anyway because of the uniform he wore but it was his habit of luring starving young women into his bed for money that made him an object of loathing in the district In really bad times the hungriest would gather at his door at nightfall vying for the chance to earn a few coins to feed their families by selling their bodies Had I been older when my father died I might have been among them Instead I learned to hunt I dont know exactly what my mother means by things starting again but Im too angry and hurting to ask Its registered though the idea of worse times returning because when the doorbell rings I shoot straight out of bed Who could it be at this hour of thenight Theres only one answer Peacekeepers They cant have him I say Might be you theyre after Haymitch reminds me Or you I say Not my house Haymitch points out But Ill get the door No Ill get it says my mother quietly We all go though following her down the hallway to the insistent ring of the bell When she opens it theres not a squad of Peacekeepers but a single snowcaked figure Madge She holds out a small damp cardboard box to me Use these for your friend she says I take off the lid of the box revealing half a dozen vials of clear liquid Theyre my mothers She said I could take them Use them please She runs back into the storm before we can stop her Crazy girl Haymitch mutters as we follow my mother into the kitchen Whatever my mother had given Gale I was right it isnt enough His teeth are gritted and his flesh shines with sweat My mother fills a syringe with the clear liquid fromone of the vials and shoots it into his arm Almost immediately his face begins to relax What is that stuff asks Peeta Its from the Capitol Its called morphling my mother answers I didnt even know Madge knew Gale says Peeta We used to sell herstrawberries I say almost angrily What am I angry about though Not that she has brought the medicine surely She must have quite a taste for them says HaymitchThats what nettles me Its the implication that theres something going on between Gale and Madge And I dont like it Shes my friend is all I say Now that Gale has drifted away on the painkiller everyone seems to deflate Prim makes us each eat some stew and bread A room is offered to Hazelle but she has to go home to the other kids Haymitchand Peeta are both willing to stay but my mother sends them home to bed as well She knows its pointless to try this with me and leaves me to tend Gale while she and Prim rest Alone in the kitchen with Gale I sit on Hazelles stool holding his hand After a while my fingers find his face I touch parts of him I have never had cause to touch before His heavy dark eyebrows the curve of his cheek the line of his nose the hollow at the base of his neck I trace the outline of stubble on his jaw and finally work my way to his lips Soft and full slightly chapped His breath warms my chilled skin Does everyone look younger asleep Because right now he could be the boy I ran into in the woods years ago the one who accused me of stealing from his traps What a pair we werefatherless frightened but fiercely committed too to keeping our families alive Desperate yet no longer alone after that day because wed found eachother I think of a hundred moments in the woods lazy afternoons fishing the day I taught him to swim that time I twisted my knee and he carried me home Mutually counting on each other watching each others backs forcing each other to be brave For the first time I reverse our positions in my head I imagine watching Gale volunteering to save Rory in the reaping having him torn from my life becoming some strange girls lover to stay alive and then coming home with her Living next to her Promising to marry her The hatred I feel for him for the phantom girl for everything is so real and immediate that it chokes me Gale is mine I am his Anything else is unthinkable Why did it take him being whipped within an inch of his life to see it Because Im selfish Im a coward Im the kind of girl who when she might actually be of use would run to stay alive and leave those who couldnt follow to suffer and die This isthe girl Gale met in the woods today No wonder I won the Games No decent person ever does You saved Peeta I think weakly But now I question even that I knew good and well that my life back in District  would be unlivable if I let that boy die I rest my head forward on the edge of the table overcome with loathing for myself Wishing I had died in the arena Wishing Seneca Crane had blown me to bits the way President Snow said he should have when I held out the berries The berries I realize the answer to who I am lies in that handful of poisonous fruit If I held them out to save Peeta because I knew I would be shunned if I came back without him then I am despicable If I held them out becauseI loved him I am still selfcentered although forgivable But if I held them out to defy the Capitol I amsomeone of worth The trouble is I dont know exactly what was going on inside me at that moment Could it be the people in the districts are right That it was an act of rebellion even if it was an unconscious one Because deep down I must know it isnt enough to keep myself or my family or my friends alive by running away Even if I could It wouldnt fix anything It wouldnt stop people from being hurt the way Gale was today Life in District  isnt really so different from life in the arena At some point you have to stop running and turn around and face whoever wants you dead The hard thing is finding the courage to do it Well its not hard for Gale He was born a rebel Im the one making an escape plan Im so sorry I whisper I lean forward and kiss him His eyelashes flutter and he looks at me through a haze of opiates Hey Catnip Hey Gale I say Thought youd be gone by now he says My choices are simple I can dielike quarry in the woods or I can die here beside Gale Im not going anywhere Im going to stay right here and cause all kinds of trouble Me too Gale says He just manages a smile before the drugs pull him back under Someone gives my shoulder a shake and I sit up Ive fallen asleep with my face on the table The white cloth has left creases on my good cheek The other the one that took the lash from Thread throbs painfully Gales dead to the world but his fingers are locked around mine I smell fresh bread and turn my stiff neck to find Peeta looking down at me with such a sad expression I get the sense that hes been watching us awhile Go on up to bed Katniss Ill look after him now he says Peeta About what I said yesterday about running I begin I know he says Theres nothing to explain I see the loaves of bread on the counter in the pale snowy morning light The blue shadows under his eyes Iwonder if he slept at all Couldnt have been long I think of his agreeing to go with me yesterday his stepping up beside me to protect Gale his willingness to throw his lot in with mine entirely when I give him so little in return No matter what I do Im hurting someone Peeta Just go to bed okay he says I feel my way up the stairs crawl under the covers and fall asleep at once At some point Clove the girl from District  enters my dreams She chases me pins me to the ground and pulls out a knife to cut my face It digs deeply into my cheek opening a wide gash Then Clove begins to transform her face elongating into a snout dark fur sprouting from her skin her fingernails growing into long claws but her eyes remain unchanged She becomes the muttation form of herself the wolflike creation of the Capitol that terrorized us the last night in the arena Tossing back her head she lets out along eerie howl that is picked up by other mutts nearby Clove begins to lap the blood flowing from my wound each lick sending a new wave of pain through my face I give a strangled cry and wake with a start sweating and shivering at once Cradling my damaged cheek in my hand I remind myself that it was not Clove but Thread who gave me this wound I wish that Peeta were here to hold me until I remember Im not supposed to wish that anymore I have chosen Gale and the rebellion and a future with Peeta is the Capitols design not mine The swelling around my eye has gone down and I can open it a bit I push aside the curtains and see the snowstorm has strengthened to a fullout blizzard Theres nothing but whiteness and the howling wind that sounds remarkably like the muttations I welcome the blizzard with its ferocious winds and deep drifting snow This may be enough to keep the real wolvesalso known as the Peacekeepers from my door A few days to think To work out a plan With Gale and Peeta and Haymitch all at hand This blizzard is a gift Before I go down to face this new life though I take some time making myself acknowledge what it will mean Less than a day ago I was prepared to head into the wilderness with my loved ones in midwinter with the very real possibility of the Capitol pursuing us A precarious venture at best But now I am committing to something even more risky Fighting the Capitol assures their swift retaliation I must accept that at any moment I can be arrested There will be a knock on the door like the one last night a band of Peacekeepers to haul me away There might be torture Mutilation A bullet through my skull in the town square if Im fortunate enough to go that quickly The Capitol has no end of creative ways to kill people I imagine these things and Im terrified but letsface it Theyve been lurking in the back of my brain anyway Ive been a tribute in the Games Been threatened by the president Taken a lash across my face Im already a target Now comes the harder part I have to face the fact that my family and friends might share this fate Prim I need only to think of Prim and all my resolve disintegrates Its my job to protect her I pull the blanket up over my head and my breathing is so rapid I use up all the oxygen and begin to choke for air I cant let the Capitol hurt Prim And then it hits me They already have They have killed her father in those wretched mines They have sat by as she almost starved to death They have chosen her as a tribute then made her watch her sister fight to the death in the Games She has been hurt far worse than I had at the age of twelve And even that pales in comparison with Rues life I shove off the blanket and suck in the cold air that seeps through thewindowpanes Prim  Rue  arent they the very reason I have to try to fight Because what has been done to them is so wrong so beyond justification soevil that there is no choice Because no one has the right to treat them as they have been treated Yes This is the thing to remember when fear threatens to swallow me up What I am about to do whatever any of us are forced to endure it is for them Its too late to help Rue but maybe not too late for those five little faces that looked up at me from the square in District  Not too late for Rory and Vick and Posy Not too late for Prim Gale is right If people have the courage this could be an opportunity Hes also right that since I have set it in motion I could do so much Although I have no idea what exactly that should be But deciding not to run away is a crucial first step I take a shower and thismorning my brain is not assembling lists of supplies for the wild but trying to figure out how they organized that uprising in District  So many so clearly acting in defiance of the Capitol Was it even planned or something that simply erupted out of years of hatred and resentment How could we do that here Would the people of District  join in or lock their doors Yesterday the square emptied so quickly after Gales whipping But isnt that because we all feel so impotent and have no idea what to do We need someone to direct us and reassure us this is possible And I dont think Im that person I may have been a catalyst for rebellion but a leader should be someone with conviction and Im barely a convert myself Someone with unflinching courage and Im still working hard at even finding mine Someone with clear and persuasive words and Im so easily tonguetied Words I think of words and I think of Peeta How peopleembrace everything he says He could move a crowd to action I bet if he chose to Would find the things to say But Im sure the idea has never crossed his mind Downstairs I find my mother and Prim tending to a subdued Gale The medicine must be wearing off by the look on his face I brace myself for another fight but try to keep my voice calm Cant you give him another shot I will if its needed We thought wed try the snow coat first says my mother She has removed his bandages You can practically see the heat radiating off his back She lays a clean cloth across his angry flesh and nods to Prim Prim comes over stirring what appears to be a large bowl of snow But its tinted a light green and gives off a sweet clean scent Snow coat She carefully begins to ladle the stuff onto the cloth I can almost hear the sizzle of Gales tormented skin meeting the snow mixture His eyes flutter open perplexed and thenhe lets out a sound of relief Its lucky we have snow says my mother I think of what it must be like to recover from a whipping in midsummer with the searing heat and the tepid water from the tap What did you do in warm months I ask A crease appears between my mothers eyebrows as she frowns Tried to keep the flies away Mystomach turns at the thought She fills a handkerchief with the snowcoat mixture and I hold it to the weal on my cheek Instantly the pain withdraws Its the coldness of the snow yes but whatever mix of herbal juices my mother has added numbs as well Oh Thats wonderful Why didnt you put this on him last night I needed the wound to set first she says I dont know what that means exactly but as long as it works who am I to question her She knows what shes doing my mother I feel a pang of remorse about yesterday the awful things I yelled at her as Peeta and Haymitch dragged me from the kitchen Im sorry About screaming at you yesterday Ive heard worse she says Youve seen how people are when someone they love is in pain Someone they love The words numb my tongue as if its been packed in snow coat Of course I love Gale But what kind of love does she mean What do I mean when I say I love Gale I dont know I did kiss him last night in a moment when my emotions were running so high But Im sure he doesnt remember it Does he I hope not If he does everything will just get more complicated and I really cant think about kissing when Ive got a rebellion to incite I give my head a little shake to clear it Wheres Peeta I say He went home when we heard you stirring Didnt want to leave his house unattended during the storm says my mother Did he get back all right I ask In a blizzard you can getlost in a matter of yards and wander off course into oblivion Why dont you give him a call and check she says I go into the study a room Ive pretty much avoided since my meeting with President Snow and dial Peetas number After a few rings he answers Hey I just wanted to make sure you got home I say Katniss I live three houses away from you he says I know but with the weather and all I say Well Im fine Thank you for checking Theres a long pause Hows Gale All right My mother and Prim are giving him snow coat now I say And your face he asks Ive got some too I say Have you seen Haymitch today I checked in on him Dead drunk But I built up his fire and left him some bread he says I wanted to talk to  to both of you I dont dare add more here on my phone which is surely tapped Probably have to wait until after the weather calms down he says Nothing much will happen beforethat anyway No nothing much I agree It takes two days for the storm to blow itself out leaving us with drifts higher than my head Another day before the path is cleared from the Victors Village to the square During this time I help tend to Gale apply snow coat to my cheek try to remember everything I can about the uprising in District  in case it will help us The swelling in my face goes down leaving me with an itchy healing wound and a very black eye But still the first chance I get I call Peeta to see if he wants to go into town with me We rouse Haymitch and drag him along with us He complains but not as much as usual We all know we need to discuss what happened and it cant be anywhere as dangerous as our homes in the Victors Village In fact we wait until the village is well behind us to even speak I spend the time studying the tenfoot walls of snow piled up on either side of the narrow path that has beencleared wondering if they will collapse in on us Finally Haymitch breaks thesilence So were all heading off into the great unknown are we he asks me No I say Not anymore Worked through the flaws in that plan did you sweetheart he asks Any new ideas I want to start an uprising I say Haymitch just laughs Its not even a mean laugh which is more troubling It shows he cant even take me seriously Well I want a drink You let me know how that works out for you though he says Then whats your plan I spit back at him My plan is to make sure everything is just perfect for your wedding says Haymitch I called and rescheduled the photo shoot without giving too many details You dont even have a phone I say Effie had that fixed he says Do you know she asked me if Id like to give you away I told herthe sooner the better Haymitch I can hear the pleading creeping into my voice Katniss He mimics my tone It wont work We shut up as a team of men with shovels passes us headed out to the Victors Village Maybe they can do something about those tenfoot walls And by the time theyre out of earshot the square is too close We step into it and all come to a stop simultaneously Nothing much will happen during the blizzard Thats what Peeta and I had agreed But we couldnt have been more wrong The square has been transformed A huge banner with the seal of Panem hangs off the roof of the Justice Building Peacekeepers in pristine white uniforms march on the cleanly swept cobblestones Along the rooftops more of them occupy nests of machine guns Most unnerving is a line of new constructions an official whipping post several stockades and a gallows  set up in the center of the squareThreads a quick worker says Haymitch Some streets away from the square I see a blaze flare up None of us has to say it That can only be the Hob going up in smoke I think of Greasy Sae Ripper all my friends who make their living there Haymitch you dont think everyone was still in I cant finish the sentence Nah theyre smarter than that Youd be too if youd been around longer he says Well I better go see how much rubbing alcohol the apothecary can spare He trudges off across the square and I look at Peeta Whats he want that for Then I realize the answer We cant let him drink it Hell kill himself or at the very least go blind Ive got some white liquor put away at home Me too Maybe that will hold him until Ripper finds a way to be back in business says Peeta I need to check on my family I have to go see Hazelle Im worried now I thought shed be on our doorstep the moment the snow was cleared Buttheres been no sign of her Ill go too Drop by the bakery on my way home he says Thanks Im suddenly very scared at what I might find The streets are almost deserted which would not be so unusual at this time of day if people were at the mines kidsat school But theyre not I see faces peeking at us out of doorways through cracks in shutters An uprising I think What an idiot I am Theres an inherent flaw in the plan that both Gale and I were too blind to see An uprising requires breaking the law thwarting authority Weve done that our whole lives or our families have Poaching trading on the black market mocking the Capitol in the woods But for most people in District  a trip to buy something at the Hob would be too risky And I expect them to assemble in the square with bricks and torches Even the sight of Peetaand me is enough to make people pull their children away from the windows and draw the curtains tightly We find Hazelle in her house nursing a very sick Posy I recognize the measles spots I couldnt leave her she says I knew Galed be in the best possible hands Of course I say Hes much better My mother says hell be back in the mines in a couple of weeks May not be open until then anyway says Hazelle Word is theyre closed until further notice She gives a nervous glance at her empty washtub You closed down too I ask Not officially says Hazelle But everyones afraid to use me now Maybe its the snow says Peeta No Rory made a quick round this morning Nothing to wash apparently she says Rory wraps his arms around Hazelle Well be all right I take a handful of money from my pocket and lay it on the table My mother will send something for Posy When were outside I turn to PeetaYou go on back I want to walk by the Hob Ill go with you he says No Ive dragged you into enough trouble I tell him And avoiding a stroll by the Hob  thats going to fix things for me He smiles and takes my hand Together we wind through the streets of the Seam until we reach the burning building They havent even bothered to leave Peacekeepers around it They know no one would try to save it The heat from the flames melts the surrounding snow and a black trickle runs across my shoes Its all that coal dust from the old days I say It was in every crack and crevice Ground into the floorboards Its amazing the place didnt go up before I want to check on Greasy Sae Not today Katniss I dont think wed be helping anyone by dropping in on them he says We go back to the square I buy some cakes from Peetas father while they exchange small talk about the weather No one mentions the ugly toolsof torture just yards from the front door The last thing I notice as we leave the square is that I do not recognize even one of the Peacekeepers faces As the days pass things go from bad to worse The mines stay shut for two weeks and by that time half of District  is starving The number of kids signing up for tesserae soars but they often dont receive their grain Food shortages begin and even those with money come away from stores emptyhandedWhen the mines reopen wages are cut hours extended miners sent into blatantly dangerous work sites The eagerly awaited food promised for Parcel Day arrives spoiled and defiled by rodents The installations in the square see plenty of action as people are dragged in and punished for offenses so long overlooked weve forgotten they are illegal Gale goes home with no more talk ofrebellion between us But I cant help thinking that everything he sees will only strengthen his resolve to fight back The hardships in the mines the tortured bodies in the square the hunger on the faces of his family Rory has signed up for tesserae something Gale cant even speak about but its still not enough with the inconsistent availability and the everincreasing price of food The only bright spot is I get Haymitch to hire Hazelle as a housekeeper resulting in some extra money for her and greatly increasing Haymitchs standard of living Its weird going into his house finding it fresh and clean food warming on the stove He hardly notices because hes fighting a whole different battle Peeta and I tried to ration what white liquor we had but its almost run out and the last time I saw Ripper she was in the stocks I feel like a pariah when I walk through the streets Everyone avoids me in public now But theres no shortage of companyat home A steady supply of ill and injured is deposited in our kitchen before my mother who has long since stopped charging for her services Her stocks of remedies are running so low though that soon all shell have to treat the patients with is snow The woods of course are forbidden Absolutely No question Even Gale doesnt challenge this now But one morning I do And it isnt the house full of the sick and dying the bleeding backs the gauntfaced children the marching boots or the omnipresent misery that drives me under the fence Its the arrival of a crate of wedding dresses one night with a note from Effie saying that President Snow approved these himself The wedding Is he really planning to go through with it What in his twisted brain will that achieve Is it for the benefit of those in the Capitol A wedding was promised a wedding will be given And then hell kill us As a lesson tothe districts I dont know I cant make sense of it I toss and turn in bed until I cant stand it anymore I have to get out of here At least for a few hours My hands dig around in my closet until I find the insulated winter gear Cinna made for me for recreational use on the Victory Tour Waterproof boots a snowsuitthat covers me from head to toe thermal gloves I love my old hunting stuff but the trek I have in mind today is more suited to this hightech clothing I tiptoe downstairs load my game bag with food and sneak out of the house Slinking along side streets and back alleys I make my way to the weak spot in the fence closest to Rooba the butchers Since many workers cross this way to get to the mines the snows pockmarked with footprints Mine will not be noticed With all his security upgrades Thread has paid littleattention to the fence perhaps feeling harsh weather and wild animals are enough to keep everyone safely inside Even so once Im under the chain link I cover my tracks until the trees conceal them for me Dawn is just breaking as I retrieve a set of bow and arrows and begin to force a path through the drifted snow in the woods Im determined for some reason to get to the lake Maybe to say goodbye to the place to my father and the happy times we spent there because I know Ill probably never return Maybe just so I can draw a complete breath again Part of me doesnt really care if they catch me if I can see it one more time The trip takes twice as long as usual Cinnas clothes hold in the heat all right and I arrive soaked with sweat under the snowsuit while my face is numb with cold The glare of the winter sun off the snow has played games with my vision and I am so exhausted and wrapped up in my own hopeless thoughtsthat I dont notice the signs The thin stream of smoke from the chimney the indentations of recent footprints the smell of steaming pine needles I am literally a few yards from the door of the cement house when I pull up short And thats not because of the smoke or the prints or the smell Thats because of the unmistakable click of a weapon behind me Second nature Instinct I turn drawing back the arrow although I know already that the odds are not in my favor I see the white Peacekeeper uniform the pointed chin the light brown iris where my arrow will find a home But the weapon is dropping to the ground and the unarmed woman is holding something out to me in her gloved hand Stop she cries I waver unable to process this turn in events Perhaps they have orders to bring me in alive so they can torture me into incriminating every person I ever knew Yeah good luck with that I think My fingers have all butdecided to release the arrow when I see the object in the glove Its a small white circle of flat bread More of a cracker really Gray and soggy around the edges But an image is clearly stamped in the center of it PART II THE QUELLIts my mockingjay It makes no sense My bird baked into bread Unlike the stylish renderings I saw in the Capitol this is definitely not a fashion statement What isit What does that mean I ask harshly still prepared to kill It means were on your side says a tremulous voice behind me I didnt see her when I came up She must have been in the house I dont take my eyes off my current target Probably the newcomer is armed but Im betting she wont risk letting me hear the click that would mean my death wasimminent knowing I would instantly kill her companion Come around where I can see you I order She cant shes begins the woman with the cracker Come around I shout Theres a step and a dragging sound I can hear the effort the movement requires Another woman or maybe I should call her a girl since she looks about my age limps into view Shes dressed in an illfitting Peacekeepers uniform complete with the white fur cloak but its several sizes too large for her slight frame She carries no visible weapon Her hands are occupied with steadying a rough crutch made from a broken branch The toe of her right boot cant clear the snow hence the dragging I examine the girls face which is bright red from the cold Her teeth are crooked and theres a strawberry birthmark over one of her chocolate brown eyes This is no Peacekeeper No citizen of the Capitol either Who are you I ask warily but lessbelligerently My names Twill says the woman Shes older Maybe thirtyfive or so And this is Bonnie Weve run away from District Eight District  Then they must know about the uprising Whered you get the uniforms I ask I stole them from the factory says Bonnie We make them there Only I thought this one would be for  for someone else Thats why it fits so poorly The gun came from a dead Peacekeeper says Twill following my eyes That cracker in your hand With the bird Whats that about I ask Dont you know Katniss Bonnie appears genuinely surprised They recognize me Of course they recognize me My face is uncovered and Im standing here outside of District  pointing an arrow at them Who else would I be I know it matches the pin I wore in the arena She doesnt know says Bonnie softly Maybe not about any of it Suddenly I feel the need to appear on top of things I know you had anuprising in Eight Yes thats why we had to get out says Twill Well youre good and out now What are you going to do I ask Were headed for District Thirteen Twill replies Thirteen I say Theres no Thirteen It got blown off the map Seventyfive years ago says Twill Bonnie shifts on her crutch and winces Whats wrong with your leg I ask I twisted my ankle My boots are too big says Bonnie I bite my lip My instinct tells me theyre telling the truth And behind that truth is a whole lot of information Id like to get I step forward and retrieve Twills gun before lowering my bow though Then I hesitate a moment thinking of another dayin this woods when Gale and I watched a hovercraft appear out of thin air and capture two escapees from the Capitol The boy was speared and killed The redheaded girlI found out when I went to the Capitol was mutilated and turned into a mute servant called an Avox Anyone after you We dont think so We think they believe we were killed in a factory explosion says Twill Only a fluke that we werent All right lets go inside I say nodding at the cement house I follow them in carrying the gun Bonnie makes straight for the hearth and lowers herself onto a Peacekeepers cloak that has been spread before it She holds her hands to the feeble flame that burns on one end of a charred log Her skin is so pale as to be translucent and I can see the fire glow through her flesh Twill tries to arrange the cloak which must have been her own around the shivering girl A tin gallon can has been cut in half the lip ragged and dangerous It sits in the ashes filled with a handful of pine needles steaming in water Making tea I ask Were not sure really I remember seeing someone do this with pineneedles on the Hunger Games a few years back At least I think it was pine needles says Twill with a frown I remember District  an ugly urban place stinking of industrial fumes the people housed in rundown tenements Barely a blade of grass in sight No opportunity ever to learn the ways of nature Its a miracle these two have made it this far Out of food I ask Bonnie nods We took what we could but foods been so scarce Thats been gone for a while The quaver in her voice melts my remaining defenses She is just a malnourished injured girl fleeing the Capitol Well then this is your lucky day I say dropping my game bag on the floor People are starving all over the district and we still have more than enough So Ive been spreading things around a little I have my own priorities Gales family Greasy Sae some of the other Hob traders who were shut down My mother has other people patientsmostly who she wants to help This morning I purposely overstuffed my game bag with food knowing my mother would see the depleted pantry and assume I was making my rounds to the hungry I was actually buying time to go to the lake without her worrying I intended to deliver the food this evening on my return but now I can see that wont be happening From the bag I pull two fresh buns with a layer of cheese baked into the top We always seem to have a supply of these since Peeta found out they were my favorite I toss one to Twill but cross over and place the other on Bonnies lap since her handeye coordination seems a little questionable at the moment and I dont want the thing ending up in the fire Oh says Bonnie Oh is this all for me Something inside me twists as I remember another voice Rue In the arena When I gave her the leg of groosling Oh Ive never had awhole leg to myself before The disbelief of the chronically hungry Yeah eat up I say Bonnie holds the bun as if she cant quite believe its real and then sinks her teeth into it again and again unable to stop Its better if you chew it She nods trying to slow down but I know how hard it is when youre that hollow I think your teas done I scoot the tin can from the ashes Twill finds two tin cups in her pack and I dip out the tea setting it on the floor to cool They huddle together eating blowing on their tea and taking tiny scalding sips as I build up the fire I wait until they are sucking the grease from their fingers to ask So whats your story And they tell me Ever since the Hunger Games the discontent in District  had been growing It was always there of course to some degree But what differed was that talk was no longer sufficient and the idea of taking action went from a wish to a reality The textile factories thatservice Panem are loud with machinery and the din also allowed word to pass safely a pair of lips close to an ear words unnoticed unchecked Twill taught at school Bonnie was one of her pupils and when the final bell had rung both of them spent a fourhour shift at the factory that specialized in the Peacekeeper uniforms It took months for Bonnie who worked in the chilly inspection dock to secure the two uniforms a boot here a pair of pants there They were intended for Twill and her husband because it was understood that once the uprising began it would be crucial to get word of it out beyond District  if it were to spread and be successful The day Peeta and I came through and made our Victory Tour appearance was actually a rehearsal of sorts People in the crowd positioned themselves according to their teams next to the buildings they would target when the rebellion broke out That was the plan to take over thecenters of power in the city like the Justice Building the Peacekeepers Headquarters and the Communication Center in the square And at other locations in the district the railroad the granary the power station and the armory The night of my engagement the night Peeta fell to his knees and proclaimed his undying love for me in front of the cameras in the Capitol was the night the uprising began It was an ideal cover Our Victory Tour interview with Caesar Flickerman was mandatory viewing It gave the people of District  a reason to be out on the streets after dark gathering either in the square or in various community centers around the city to watch Ordinarily such activity would have been too suspicious Instead everyone was in place by the appointed hour eight oclock when the masks went on and all hell broke looseTaken by surprise and overwhelmed by sheer numbers the Peacekeepers were initially overcome by the crowds The Communication Center the granary and the power station were all secured As the Peacekeepers fell weapons were appropriated for the rebels There was hope that this had not been an act of madness that in some way if they could get the word out to other districts an actual overthrow of the government in the Capitol might be possible But then the ax fell Peacekeepers began to arrive by the thousands Hovercraft bombed the rebel strongholds into ashes In the utter chaos that followed it was all people could do to make it back to their homes alive It took less than fortyeight hours to subdue the city Then for a week there was a lockdown No food no coal everyone forbidden to leave their homes The only time the television showed anything but static was when the suspected instigators werehanged in the square Then one night as the whole district was on the brink of starvation came the order to return to business as usual That meant school for Twill and Bonnie A street made impassable by the bombs caused them to be late for their factory shift so they were still a hundred yards away when it exploded killing everyone inside  including Twills husband and Bonnies entire family Someone must have told the Capitol that the idea for the uprising had started there Twill tells me faintly The two fled back to Twills where the Peacekeeper suits were still waiting They scraped together what provisions they could stealing freely from neighbors they now knew to be dead and made it to the railroad station In a warehouse near the tracks they changed into the Peacekeeper outfits and disguised were able to make it onto a boxcar full of fabric on a train headed to District  They fled the train at a fuel stopalong the way and traveled on foot Concealed by woods but using the tracks for guidance they made it to the outskirts of District  two days ago where they were forced to stop when Bonnie twisted her ankle I understand why youre running but what do you expect to find in District Thirteen I ask Bonnie and Twill exchange a nervous glance Were not sure exactly Twill says Its nothing but rubble I say Weve all seen the footage Thats just it Theyve been using the same footage for as long as anyone in District Eight can remember says Twill Really I try to think back to call up the images of  Ive seen on television You know how they always show the Justice Building Twill continues I nod Ive seen it a thousand times If you look very carefully youll see it Up in the far righthand corner See what I ask Twill holds out her cracker with the bird again A mockingjay Just a glimpse of it as it flies by Thesame one every time Back home we think they keep reusing the old footage because the Capitol cant show whats reallythere now says Bonnie I give a grunt of disbelief Youre going to District Thirteen based on that A shot of a bird You think youre going to find some new city with people strolling around in it And thats just fine with the Capitol No Twill says earnestly We think the people moved underground when everything on the surface was destroyed We think theyve managed to survive And we think the Capitol leaves them alone because before the Dark Days District Thirteens principal industry was nuclear development They were graphite miners I say But then I hesitate because thats information I got from the Capitol They had a few small mines yes But not enough to justify apopulation of that size That I guess is the only thing we know for sure says Twill My hearts beating too quickly What if theyre right Could it be true Could there be somewhere to run besides the wilderness Somewhere safe If a community exists in District  would it be better to go there where I might be able to accomplish something instead of waiting here for my death But then  if there are people in District  with powerful weapons  Why havent they helped us I say angrily If its true why do they leave us to live like this With the hunger and the killings and the Games And suddenly I hate this imaginary underground city of District  and those who sit by watching us die Theyre no better than the Capitol We dont know Bonnie whispers Right now were just holding on to the hope that they exist That snaps me to my senses These are delusions District  doesnt exist because the Capitol would never letit exist Theyre probably mistaken about the footage Mockingjays are about as rare as rocks And about as tough If they could survive the initial bombing of  theyre probably doing better than ever now Bonnie has no home Her family is dead Returning to District  or assimilating into another district would be impossible Of course the idea of an independent thriving District  draws her I cant bring myself to tell her shes chasing a dream as insubstantial as a wisp of smoke Perhaps she and Twill can carve out a life somehow in the woods I doubt it but theyre so pitiful I have to try to help First I give them all the food in my pack grain and dried beans mostly but theres enough to hold them for a while if theyre careful Then I take Twill out in the woods and try to explain the basics of hunting Shes got a weapon that if necessary can convert solar energy into deadly rays of power so that could last indefinitely Whenshe manages to kill her first squirrel the poor thing is mostly a charred mess because it took a direct hit to the body But I show her how to skin and clean it With some practice shell figure it out I cut a new crutch for Bonnie Back at the house I peel off an extra layer of socks for the girl telling her to stuff them in the toes ofher boots to walk then wear them on her feet at night Finally I teach them how to build a proper fire They beg me for details of the situation in District  and I tell them about life under Thread I can see they think this is important information that theyll be bringing to those who run District  and I play along so as not to destroy their hopes But when the light signals late afternoon Im out of time to humor them I have to go now I say They pour out thanks and embrace me Tears spill from Bonnies eyes I cantbelieve we actually got to meet you Youre practically all anyones talked about since I know I know Since I pulled out those berries I say tiredly I hardly notice the walk home even though a wet snow begins to fall My mind is spinning with new information about the uprising in District  and the unlikely but tantalizing possibility of District  Listening to Bonnie and Twill confirmed one thing President Snow has been playing me for a fool All the kisses and endearments in the world couldnt have derailed the momentum building up in District  Yes my holding out the berries had been the spark but I had no way to control the fire He must have known that So why visit my home why order me to persuade the crowd of my love for Peeta It was obviously a ploy to distract me and keep me from doing anything else inflammatory in the districts And to entertain the people in the Capitol of course I suppose the wedding isjust a necessary extension of that Im nearing the fence when a mockingjay lights on a branch and trills at me At the sight of it I realize I never got a full explanation of the bird on the cracker and what it signifies It means were on your side Thats what Bonnie said I have people on my side What side Am I unwittingly the face of the hopedfor rebellion Has the mockingjay on my pin become a symbol of resistance If so my sides not doing too well You only have to look at what happened in  to know that I stash my weapons in the hollow log nearest my old home in the Seam and head for the fence Im crouched on one knee preparing to enter the Meadow but Im still so preoccupied with the days events that it takes a sudden screech of an owl to bring me to my senses In the fading light the chain links look as innocuous as usual But what makes me jerk back my hand is the sound like the buzz of a tree full of tracker jacker nestsindicating the fence is alive with electricity My feet back up automatically and I blend into the trees I cover my mouth with my glove to disperse the white of my breath in the icy air Adrenaline courses through me wiping all the concerns of the day from my mind as I focus on the immediate threat before me What is going on Has Thread turned on the fence as an additional security precaution Or does he somehow know Ive escaped his net today Is he determined to strand me outside District  until hecan apprehend and arrest me Drag me to the square to be locked in the stockade or whipped or hanged Calm down I order myself Its not as if this is the first time Ive been caught outside of the district by an electrified fence Its happened a few times over the years but Gale was always with me The two of us would just pick a comfortable tree tohang out in until the power shut off which it always did eventually If I was running late Prim even got in the habit of going to the Meadow to check if the fence was charged to spare my mother worry But today my family would never imagine Id be in the woods Ive even taken steps to mislead them So if I dont show up worry they will And theres a part of me thats worried too because Im not sure its just a coincidence the power coming on the very day I return to the woods I thought no one saw me sneak under the fence but who knows There are always eyes for hire Someone reported Gale kissing me in that very spot Still that was in daylight and before I was more careful about my behavior Could there be surveillance cameras Ive wondered about this before Is this the way President Snow knows about the kiss It was dark when I went under and my face was bundled in a scarf But the list of suspects likely to be trespassing intothe woods is probably very short My eyes peer through the trees past the fence into the Meadow All I can see is the wet snow illuminated here and there by the light from the windows on the edge of the Seam No Peacekeepers in sight no signs I am being hunted Whether Thread knows I left the district today or not I realize my course of action must be the same to get back inside the fence unseen and pretend I never left Any contact with the chain link or the coils of barbed wire that guard the top would mean instant electrocution I dont think I can burrow under the fence without risking detection and the grounds frozen hard anyway That leaves only one choice Somehow Im going to have to go over it I begin to skirt along the tree line searching for a tree with a branch high and long enough to fit my needs After about a mile I come upon an old maple that might do The trunk is too wide and icy to shinny up thoughand there are no low branches I climb a neighboring tree and leap precariously into the maple almost losing my hold on the slick bark But I manage to get a grip and slowly inch my way out on a limb that hangs above the barbed wire As I look down I remember why Gale and I always waited in the woods rather than try to tackle the fence Being high enough to avoid getting fried means youve got to be at least twenty feet in the air I guess my branch must be twentyfive Thats a dangerously long drop even for someone whos had years of practice in trees But what choice do I have I could look for another branch but its almost dark now The falling snow will obscure any moonlight Here at least I cansee Ive got a snowbank to cushion my landing Even if I could find another which is doubtful who knows what Id be jumping into I throw my empty game bag around myneck and slowly lower myself until Im hanging by my hands For a moment I gather my courage Then I release my fingers Theres the sensation of falling then I hit the ground with a jolt that goes right up my spine A second later my rear end slams the ground I lie in the snow trying to assess the damage Without standing I can tell by the pain in my left heel and my tailbone that Im injured The only question is how badly Im hoping for bruises but when I force myself onto my feet I suspect Ive broken something as well I can walk though so I get moving trying to hide my limp as best I can My mother and Prim cant know I was in the woods I need to work up some sort of alibi no matter how thin Some of the shops in the square are still open so I go in one and purchase white cloth for bandages Were running low anyway In another I buy a bag of sweets for Prim I stick one of the candies in my mouth feeling thepeppermint melt on my tongue and realize its the first thing Ive eaten all day I meant to make a meal at the lake but once I saw Twill and Bonnies condition it seemed wrong to take a single mouthful from them By the time I reach my house my left heel will bear no weight at all I decide to tell my mother I was trying to mend a leak in the roof of our old house and slid off As for the missing food Ill just be vague about who I handed it out to I drag myself in the door all ready to collapse in front of the fire But instead I get anothershock Two Peacekeepers a man and a woman are standing in the doorway to our kitchen The woman remains impassive but I catch the flicker of surprise on the mans face I am unanticipated They know I was in the woods and should be trapped there now Hello I say in a neutralvoice My mother appears behind them but keeps her distance Here she is just in time for dinner she says a little too brightly Im very late for dinner I consider removing my boots as I normally would but doubt I can manage it without revealing my injuries Instead I just pull off my wet hood and shake the snow from my hair Can I help you with something I ask the Peacekeepers Head Peacekeeper Thread sent us with a message for you says the woman Theyve been waiting for hours my mother adds Theyve been waiting for me to fail to return To confirm I got electrocuted by the fence or trapped in the woods so they could take my family in for questioning Must be an important message I say May we ask where youve been Miss Everdeen the woman asks Easier to ask where I havent been I say with a sound of exasperation I cross into the kitchen forcing myself to use my foot normallyeven though every step is excruciating I pass between the Peacekeepers and make it to the table all right I fling my bag down and turn to Prim whos standing stiffly by the hearth Haymitch and Peeta are there as well sitting in a pair of matching rockers playing a game of chess Were they here by chance or invited by the Peacekeepers Either way Im glad to see them So where havent you been says Haymitch in a bored voice Well I havent been talking to the Goat Man about getting Prims goat pregnant because someone gave me completely inaccurate information as to where he lives I say to Prim emphatically No I didnt says Prim I told you exactly You said he lives beside the west entrance to the mine I say The east entrance Prim corrects me You distinctly said the west because then I said Next to the slag heap and you said Yeah I say The slag heap next to the east entrance says Prim patientlyNo When did you say that I demand Last night Haymitch chimes in It was definitely the east adds Peeta He looks at Haymitch and they laugh I glare at Peeta and he tries to look contrite Im sorry but its what Ive been saying You dont listen when people talk to you Bet people told you he didnt live there today and you didnt listen again says Haymitch Shut up Haymitch I say clearly indicating hes right Haymitch and Peeta crack up and Prim allows herself a smile Fine Somebody else can arrange to get the stupid goat knocked up I say which makes them laugh more And I think This is why theyve made it this far Haymitch and Peeta Nothing throws them I look at the Peacekeepers The mans smiling but the woman isunconvinced Whats in the bag she asks sharply I know shes hoping for game or wild plants Something thatclearly condemns me I dump the contents on the table See for yourself Oh good says my mother examining the cloth Were running low on bandages Peeta comes to the table and opens the candy bag Ooh peppermints he says popping one in his mouth Theyre mine I take a swipe for the bag He tosses it to Haymitch who stuffs a fistful of sweets in his mouth before passing the bag to a giggling Prim None of you deserves candy I say What because were right Peeta wraps his arms around me I give a small yelp of pain as my tailbone objects I try to turn it into a sound of indignation but I can see in his eyes that he knows Im hurt Okay Prim said west I distinctly heard west And were all idiots Hows that Better I say and accept his kiss Then I look at the Peacekeepers as if Im suddenly remembering theyre there You have a message for me From Head Peacekeeper Thread says the womanHe wanted you to know that the fence surrounding District Twelve will now have electricity twentyfour hours a day Didnt it already I ask a little too innocently He thought you might be interested in passing this information on to your cousin says the woman Thank you Ill tell him Im sure well all sleep a little more soundly now that security has addressed that lapse Im pushing things I know it but the comment gives me a sense of satisfaction The womans jaw tightens None of this has gone as planned but she has no further orders She gives me a curt nod and leaves the man trailing in her wake When my mother has locked the door behind them I slump against the table What is it says Peeta holding me steadily Oh I banged up my left foot The heel And my tailbones had a bad day too He helps me over to one of the rockers and I lower myself onto the padded cushion My mother eases off my boots Whathappened I slipped and fell I say Four pairs of eyes look at me with disbelief On some ice But we all know the house must be bugged and its not safe to talk openly Not here not now Having stripped off my sock my mothers fingers probe the bones in my left heel and I wince There might be a break she says She checks the other foot This one seems all right She judges my tailbone to be badly bruised Prims dispatched to get my pajamas and robe When Im changed my mother makes a snow pack for my left heel and props it up on a hassock I eat three bowls of stew and half a loaf of bread while the others dine at the table I stare at the fire thinking of Bonnie and Twill hoping that the heavy wet snow has erased my tracks Prim comes and sits on the floor next to me leaning her head against my knee We suck on peppermints as I brush her soft blond hair back behind her ear How was school I ask All rightWe learned about coal byproducts she says We stare at the fire for a while Are you going to try on your wedding dresses Not tonight Tomorrow probably I say Wait until I get home okay she says Sure If they dont arrest me first My mother gives me a cup of chamomile tea with a dose of sleep syrup and my eyelids begin to droop immediately She wraps my bad foot and Peeta volunteers to get me to bed I start out by leaning on his shoulder but Im so wobbly he just scoops me up and carries me upstairs He tucks me in and says good night but I catch his hand and hold him there A side effect of the sleep syrup is that it makes people less inhibited like white liquor and I know I have to control my tongue But I dont want him to go In fact I want him to climb in with me to be there when the nightmares hit tonight For some reason that I cant quite form I know Im not allowed to ask that Dont go yet Notuntil I fall asleep I say Peeta sits on the side of the bed warming my hand in both of his Almost thought youd changed your mind today When you were late for dinner Im foggy but I can guess what he means With the fence going on and me showing up late and the Peacekeepers waiting he thought Id made a run for it maybe with Gale No Id have told you I say I pull his hand up and lean my cheek against the back of it taking in the faint scent of cinnamon and dill from the breads he must have baked today I want to tell him about Twill and Bonnie and the uprising and the fantasy of District  but its not safe to and I can feel myself slipping away so I just get out one more sentence Stay with me As the tendrils of sleep syrup pull me down I hear him whisper a word back but I dont quite catch it My mother lets me sleep until noon then rouses me to examine my heel Im ordered to a week of bed rest and Idont object because I feel so lousy Not just my heel and my tailbone My whole body aches with exhaustion So I let my mother doctor me and feed me breakfast in bed and tuck another quilt around me Then I just lie there staring out my window at the winter sky pondering how on earth this will all turn out I think a lot about Bonnie and Twill and the pile of white wedding dresses downstairs and if Thread will figure out how I got back in and arrest me Its funny because he could just arrest me anyway based on past crimes but maybe he has to have something really irrefutable to do it now that Im a victor And I wonder if President Snows in contact with Thread I think its unlikely he ever acknowledged that old Cray existed but now that Im such a nationwide problem is he carefully instructing Thread what to do Or is Thread acting on his own At any rate Im sure theyd both agree on keeping me locked uphere inside the district with that fence Even if I could figure out some way to escapemaybe get a rope up to that maple tree branch andclimb outthered be no escaping with my family and friends now I told Gale I would stay and fight anyway For the next few days I jump every time theres a knock on the door No Peacekeepers show up to arrest me though so eventually I begin to relax Im further reassured when Peeta casually tells me the power is off in sections of the fence because crews are out securing the base of the chain link to the ground Thread must believe I somehow got under the thing even with that deadly current running through it Its a break for the district having the Peacekeepers busy doing something besides abusing people Peeta comes by every day to bring me cheese buns and begins to help me work onthe family book Its an old thing made of parchment and leather Some herbalist on my mothers side of the family started it ages ago The books composed of page after page of ink drawings of plants with descriptions of their medical uses My father added a section on edible plants that was my guidebook to keeping us alive after his death For a long time Ive wanted to record my own knowledge in it Things I learned from experience or from Gale and then the information I picked up when I was training for the Games I didnt because Im no artist and its so crucial that the pictures are drawn in exact detail Thats where Peeta comes in Some of the plants he knows already others we have dried samples of and others I have to describe He makes sketches on scrap paper until Im satisfied theyre right then I let him draw them in the book After that I carefully print all I know about the plant Its quiet absorbing work thathelps take my mind off my troubles I like to watch his hands as he works making a blank page bloom with strokes of ink adding touches of color to our previously black and yellowish book His face takes on a special look when he concentrates His usual easy expression is replaced by something more intense and removed that suggests an entire world locked away inside him Ive seen flashes of this before in the arena or when he speaks to a crowd or that time he shoved the Peacekeepers guns away from me in District  I dont know quite what to make of it I also become a little fixated on his eyelashes which ordinarily you dont notice much because theyre so blond But up close in the sunlight slanting in from the window theyre a light golden color and so long I dont see how they keep from getting all tangled up when he blinks One afternoon Peeta stops shading a blossom and looks up so suddenly that I start as though I were caught spying on him which in a strange way maybe I was But he only says You know I think this is the first time weve ever done anything normal together Yeah I agree Our whole relationship has been tainted by the Games Normal was never a part of it Nice for a change Each afternoon he carries me downstairs for a change of scenery and I unnerve everyone by turning on the television Usually we only watch when its mandatory because the mixture of propaganda and displays of the Capitols powerincluding clips from seventyfour years of Hunger Games  is so odious But now Im looking for something special The mockingjay that Bonnie and Twill are basing all their hopes on I know its probably foolishness but if it is I want to rule it out And erase the idea of a thriving District  from mymind for good My first sighting is in a news story referencing the Dark Days I see the smoldering remains of the Justice Building in District  and just catch the blackandwhite underside of a mockingjays wing as it flies across the upper righthand corner That doesnt prove anything really Its just an old shot that goes with an old tale However several days later something else grabs my attention The main newscaster is reading a piece about a shortage of graphite affecting the manufacturing of items in District  They cut to what is supposed to be live footage of a female reporter encased in a protective suit standing in front of the ruins of the Justice Building in  Through her mask she reports that unfortunately a study has just today determined that the mines of District  are still too toxic to approach End of story But just before they cut back to the main newscaster I see the unmistakable flash of that samemockingjays wing The reporter has simply been incorporated into the old footage Shes not in District  at all Which begs the question What is Staying quietly in bed is harder after that I want to be doing something finding out more about District  or helping in the cause to bring down the Capitol Instead I sit around stuffing myself with cheese buns and watching Peeta sketch Haymitch stops by occasionally to bring me news from town which is always bad More people being punished or dropping from starvation Winter has begun to withdraw by the time my foot is deemed usable My mother gives me exercises to do and lets me walk on my own a bit I go to sleep one night determined to go into town the next morning but I awake to find Venia Octavia and Flavius grinning down at me Surprise they squeal Were here early After I took that lash in the face Haymitch got their visit pushed back severalmonths so I could heal up I wasnt expecting them for another three weeks But I try to act delighted that my bridal photo shoot is here at last My mother hung upall the dresses so theyre ready to go but to be honest I havent even tried one on After the usual histrionics about the deteriorated state of my beauty they get right down to business Their biggest concern is my face although I think my mother did a pretty remarkable job healing it Theres just a pale pink strip across my cheekbone The whippings not common knowledge so I tell them I slipped on the ice and cut it And then I realize thats my same excuse for hurting my foot which is going to make walking in high heels a problem But Flavius Octavia and Venia arent the suspicious types so Im safe there Since I only have to look hairless for a few hours instead of several weeks I get to beshaved instead of waxed I still have to soak in a tub of something but it isnt vile and were on to my hair and makeup before I know it The team as usual is full of news which I usually do my best to tune out But then Octavia makes a comment that catches my attention Its a passing remark really about how she couldnt get shrimp for a party but it tugs at me Why couldnt you get shrimp Is it out of season I ask Oh Katniss we havent been able to get any seafood for weeks says Octavia You know because the weathers been so bad in District Four My mind starts buzzing No seafood For weeks From District  The barely concealed rage in the crowd during the Victory Tour And suddenly I am absolutely sure that District  has revolted I begin to question them casually about what other hardships this winter has brought them They are not used to want so any little disruption in supply makes an impact on them Bythe time Im ready to be dressed their complaints about the difficulty of getting different products  from crabmeat to music chips to ribbons  has given me a sense of which districts might actually be rebelling Seafood from District  Electronic gadgets from District  And of course fabrics from District  The thought of such widespread rebellion has me quivering with fear and excitement I want to ask them more but Cinna appears to give me a hug and check my makeup His attention goes right to the scar on my cheek Somehow I dont think he believes the slippingontheice story but he doesnt question it He simply adjusts the powder on my face and what little you can see of the lash mark vanishes Downstairs the living room has been cleared and lit for the photo shoot Effies having a fine time ordering everybody around keeping us all on schedule Its probably a good thing because there are six gowns and eachone requires its own headpiece shoes jewelry hair makeup setting and lighting Creamy lace and pink roses and ringlets Ivory satin and gold tattoos and greenery A sheath of diamonds and jeweled veil and moonlight Heavy white silk and sleeves that fall from my wrist to the floor and pearls The moment one shot has been approved we move right intopreparing for the next I feel like dough being kneaded and reshaped again and again My mother manages to feed me bits of food and sips of tea while they work on me but by the time the shoot is over Im starving and exhausted Im hoping to spend some time with Cinna now but Effie whisks everybody out the door and I have to make do with the promise of a phone call Evening has fallen and my foot hurts from all the crazy shoes so I abandon any thoughts of goinginto town Instead I go upstairs and wash away the layers of makeup and conditioners and dyes and then go down to dry my hair by the fire Prim who came home from school in time to see the last two dresses chatters on about them with my mother They both seem overly happy about the photo shoot When I fall into bed I realize its because they think it means Im safe That the Capitol has overlooked my interference with the whipping since no one is going to go to such trouble and expense for someone they plan on killing anyway Right In my nightmare Im dressed in the silk bridal gown but its torn and muddy The long sleeves keep getting caught on thorns and branches as I run through the woods The pack of muttation tributes draws closer and closer until it overcomes me with hot breath and dripping fangs and I scream myself awake Its too close to dawn to bother trying to get back to sleep Besides today I reallypreparing for the next I feel like dough being kneaded and reshaped again and again My mother manages to feed me bits of food and sips of tea while they work on me but by the time the shoot is over Im starving and exhausted Im hoping to spend some time with Cinna now but Effie whisks everybody out the door and I have to make do with the promise of a phone call Evening has fallen and my foot hurts from all the crazy shoes so I abandon any thoughts of going into town Instead I go upstairs and wash away the layers of makeup and conditioners and dyes and then go down to dry my hair by the fire Prim who came home from school in time to see the last two dresses chatters on about them with my mother They both seem overly happy about the photo shoot When I fall into bed I realize its because they think it means Im safe That the Capitol has overlooked my interference with the whipping since no one is going to go tosuch trouble and expense for someone they plan on killing anyway Right In my nightmare Im dressed in the silk bridal gown but its torn and muddy The long sleeves keep getting caught on thorns and branches as I run through the woods The pack of muttation tributes draws closer and closer until it overcomes me with hot breath and dripping fangs and I scream myself awake Its too close to dawn to bother trying to get back to sleep Besides today I really have to get out and talk to someone Gale will be unreachable in the mines But I need Haymitch or Peeta or somebody to share the burden of all that has happened to me since I went to the lake Fleeing outlaws electrified fences an independent District  shortages in the Capitol Everything I eat breakfast with my mother and Prim and head out in search of a confidant The airs warm with hopeful hints of spring in it Spring would be a good time foran uprising I think Everyone feels less vulnerable once winter passes Peetas not home I guess hes already gone into town Im surprised to see Haymitch moving around his kitchen so early though I walk into his house without knocking I can hear Hazelle upstairs sweeping the floors of the nowspotless house Haymitch isnt flatout drunk but he doesnt look too steady either I guess the rumors about Ripper being back in business are true Im thinking maybe I better let him just go to bed when he suggests a walk to town Haymitch and I can speak in a kind of shorthand now In a few minutes Ive updated him and hes told me about rumors of uprisings in Districts  and  as well If my hunches are right this would mean almost half the districts have at least attempted to rebel Do you still think it wont work here I ask Not yet Those other districts theyre much larger Even if half the people cowerin their homes the rebels stand a chance Here in Twelve its got to be all of us or nothing he says I hadnt thought of that How we lack strength of numbers But maybe atsome point I insist Maybe But were small were weak and we dont develop nuclear weapons says Haymitch with a touch of sarcasm He didnt get too excited over my District  story What do you think theyll do Haymitch To the districts that are rebelling I ask Well youve heard what they did in Eight Youve seen what they did here and that was without provocation says Haymitch If things really do get out of hand I think theyd have no problem killing off another district same as they did Thirteen Make an example of it you know So you think Thirteen was really destroyed I mean Bonnie and Twill were right about the footage of the mockingjay I sayOkay but what does that prove Nothing really There are plenty of reasons they could be using old footage Probably it looks more impressive And its a lot simpler isnt it To just press a few buttons in the editing room than to fly all the way out there and film it he says The idea that Thirteen has somehow rebounded and the Capitol is ignoring it That sounds like the kind of rumor desperate people cling to I know I was just hoping I say Exactly Because youre desperate says Haymitch I dont argue because of course hes right Prim comes home from school bubbling over with excitement The teachers announced there was mandatory programming tonight I think its going to be your photo shoot It cant be Prim They only did the pictures yesterday I tell her Well thats what somebody heard she says Im hoping shes wrong I havent had time to prepare Gale for any of this Since the whipping I only seehim when he comes to the house for my mother to check how hes healing Hes often scheduled seven days a week in the mine In the few minutes of privacy weve had with me walking him back to town I gather that the rumblings of an uprising in  have been subdued by Threads crackdown He knows Im not going to run But he must also know that if we dont revolt in  Im destined to be Peetas bride Seeing me lounging around in gorgeous gowns on his television  what can he do with that When we gather around the television at seventhirty I discover that Prim is right Sure enough theres Caesar Flickerman speaking before a standingroomonly crowd in front of the Training Center talking to an appreciative crowd about my upcoming nuptials He introduces Cinna who became an overnight star with his costumes for me in the Games and after a minute of goodnatured chitchat were directed toturn our attention to a giant screen I see now how they could photograph me yesterday and present the special tonight Initially Cinna designed two dozen wedding gowns Since then theres been the process of narrowing down the designs creating the dresses and choosing the accessories Apparently in the Capitol there were opportunities to vote for your favorites at each stage This is allculminating with shots of me in the final six dresses which Im sure took no time at all to insert in the show Each shot is met with a huge reaction from the crowd People screaming and cheering for their favorites booing the ones they dont like Having voted and probably bet on the winner people are very invested in my wedding gown Its bizarre to watch when I think how I never even bothered to try one on before the cameras arrived Caesar announcesthat interested parties must cast their final vote by noon on the following day Lets get Katniss Everdeen to her wedding in style he hollers to the crowd Im about to shut off the television but then Caesar is telling us to stay tuned for the other big event of the evening Thats right this year will be the seventyfifth anniversary of the Hunger Games and that means its time for our third Quarter Quell What will they do asks Prim It isnt for months yet We turn to our mother whose expression is solemn and distant as if shes remembering something It must be the reading of the card The anthem plays and my throat tightens with revulsion as President Snow takes the stage Hes followed by a young boy dressed in a white suit holding a simple wooden box The anthem ends and President Snow begins to speak to remind us all of the Dark Days from which the Hunger Games were born When the laws for the Games were laidout they dictated that every twentyfive years the anniversary would be marked by a Quarter Quell It would call for a glorified version of the Games to make fresh the memory of those killed by the districts rebellionThese words could not be more pointed since I suspect several districts are rebelling right now President Snow goes on to tell us what happened in the previous Quarter Quells On the twentyfifth anniversary as a reminder to the rebels that their children were dying because of their choice to initiate violence every district was made to hold an election and vote on the tributes who would represent it I wonder how that would have felt Picking the kids who had to go It is worse I think to be turned over by your own neighbors than have your name drawn from the reaping ball On the fiftieth anniversary thepresident continues as a reminder that two rebels died for each Capitol citizen every district was required to send twice as many tributes I imagine facing a field of fortyseven instead of twentythree Worse odds less hope and ultimately more dead kids That was the year Haymitch won  I had a friend who went that year says my mother quietly Maysilee Donner Her parents owned the sweetshop They gave me her songbird after A canary Prim and I exchange a look Its the first weve ever heard of Maysilee Donner Maybe because my mother knew we would want to know how she died And now we honor our third Quarter Quell says the president The little boy in white steps forward holding out the box as he opens the lid We can see the tidy upright rows of yellowed envelopes Whoever devised the Quarter Quell system had prepared for centuries of Hunger Games The president removes anenvelope clearly marked with a  He runs his finger under the flap and pulls out a small square of paper Without hesitation he reads On the seventyfifth anniversary as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol the male and female tributes will be reaped from their existing pool of victors My mother gives a faint shriek and Prim buries her face in her hands but I feel more like the people I see in the crowd on television Slightly baffled What does it mean Existing pool of victors Then I get it what it means At least for me District  only has three existing victors to choose from Two male One female  I am going back into the arena My body reacts before my mind does and Im running out the door across the lawns of the Victors Village into the dark beyond Moisture from the sodden ground soaks my socks and Im aware of the sharp bite of thewind but I dont stop Where Where to go The woods of course Im at the fence before the hum makes me remember how very trapped I am I back away panting turn on my heel and take off again The next thing I know Im on my hands and knees in the cellar of one of the empty houses in the Victors Village Faint shafts of moonlight come in through the window wells above my head Im cold and wet and winded but my escape attempt has done nothing to subdue the hysteria rising upinside me It will drown me unless its released I ball up the front of my shirt stuff it into my mouth and begin to scream How long this continues I dont know But when I stop my voice is almost gone I curl up on my side and stare at the patches of moonlight on the cement floor Back in the arena Back in the place of nightmares Thats where I amgoing I have to admit I didnt see it coming I saw a multitude of other things Being publicly humiliated tortured and executed Fleeing through the wilderness pursued by Peacekeepers and hovercraft Marriage to Peeta with our children forced into the arena But never that I myself would have to be a player in the Games again Why Because theres no precedent for it Victors are out of the reaping for life Thats the deal if you win Until now Theres some kind of sheeting the kind they put down when they paint I pull it over me like a blanket In the distance someone is calling my name But at the moment I excuse myself from thinking about even those I love most I think only of me And what lies ahead The sheetings stiff but holds warmth My muscles relax my heart rate slows I see the wooden box in the little boys hands President Snow drawing out the yellowed envelope Is it possible that thiswas really the Quarter Quell written down seventyfive years ago It seems unlikely Its just too perfect an answer for the troubles that face the Capitol today Getting rid of me and subduing the districts all in one neat little package I hear President Snows voice in my head On the seventyfifth anniversary as a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol the male and female tributes will be reaped from their existing pool of victors Yes victors are our strongest Theyre the ones who survived the arena and slipped the noose of poverty that strangles the rest of us They or should I say we are the very embodiment of hope where there is no hope And now twentythree of us will be killed to show how even that hope was an illusion Im glad I won only last year Otherwise Id know all the other victors not just because I see them on television but because theyre guestsat every Games Even if theyre not mentoring like Haymitch always has to most return to the Capitol each year for the event I think a lot of them are friends Whereas the only friend Ill have to worry about killing will be either Peeta or Haymitch Peeta or Haymitch I sit straight up throwing off the sheeting What just went through my mind Theres no situation in which I would ever kill Peeta or Haymitch But one of them will be in the arena with me and thats a fact They may have even decided between them who it will be Whoever is picked first the other will have the option of volunteering to take his place I already know what will happen Peeta will ask Haymitch to let him go into the arena with me no matter what Formy sake To protect me I stumble around the cellar looking for an exit How did I even get into this place I feelmy way up the steps to the kitchen and see the glass window in the door has been shattered Must be why my hand seems to be bleeding I hurry back into the night and head straight to Haymitchs house Hes sitting alone at the kitchen table a halfemptied bottle of white liquor in one fist his knife in the other Drunk as a skunk Ah there she is All tuckered out Finally did the math did you sweetheart Worked out you wont be going in alone And now youre here to ask me  what he says I dont answer The windows wide open and the wind cuts through me just as if I were outside Ill admit it was easier for the boy He was here before I could snap the seal on a bottle Begging me for another chance to go in But what can you say He mimics my voice Take his place Haymitch because all things being equal Id rather Peeta had a crack at the rest of his life than you I bite my lip because once hes said it Im afraidthats what I do want For Peeta to live even if it means Haymitchs death No I dont Hes dreadful of course but Haymitch is my family now What did I come for I think What could I possibly want here I came for a drink I say Haymitch bursts out laughing and slams the bottle on the table before me I run my sleeve across the top and take a couple gulps before I come up choking It takes a few minutes to compose myself and even then my eyes and nose are still streaming But inside me the liquor feels like fire and I like it Maybe it should be you I say matteroffactly as I pull up a chair You hate life anyway Very true says Haymitch And since last time I tried to keep you alive seems like Im obligated to save the boy this time Thats another good point I say wiping my nose and tipping up the bottle again Peetas argument is that since I chose you I now owe him Anything he wants And what he wants is thechance to go in again to protect you says Haymitch I knew it In this way Peetas not hard to predict While I was wallowing around on the floor of that cellar thinking only of myself he was here thinking only of me Shame isnt a strong enough word for what I feel You could live a hundred lifetimes and not deserve him you know Haymitch says Yeah yeah I say brusquely No question hes the superior one in this trio So what are you going to do I dont know Haymitch sighs Go back in with you maybe if I can If my names drawn at the reaping it wont matter Hell just volunteer to take my place We sit for a while in silence Itd be bad for you in the arena wouldnt it Knowing all the others I ask Oh I think we can count on it being unbearable wherever I am He nods at the bottle Can I have that back now No I say wrapping my arms around it Haymitch pullsanother bottle out from under the table and gives the top a twist But I realize I am not just here for a drink Theres something else I want from Haymitch Okay I figured out what Im asking I say If it is Peeta and me in the Games this time we try to keep him alive Something flickers across his bloodshot eyes Pain Like you said its going to be bad no matter how you slice it And whatever Peeta wants its his turn to be saved We both owe him that My voice takes on a pleading tone Besides the Capitol hates me so much Im as good as dead now He still might have a chance Please Haymitch Say youll help me He frowns at his bottle weighing my words All right he says finally Thanks I say I should go see Peeta now but I dont want to My heads spinning from the drink and Im so wiped out who knows what he could get me to agree to No now I have to go home to face my mother and Prim As I stagger up the steps to myhouse the front door opens and Gale pulls me into his arms I was wrong We should have gone when you said he whispers No I say Im having trouble focusing and liquor keeps sloshing out of my bottle and down the back of Gales jacket but he doesnt seem to care Its not too late he says Over his shoulder I see my mother and Prim clutching each other in the doorway We run They die And now Ive got Peeta to protect End of discussion Yeah it is My knees give way and hes holding me up As the alcohol overcomes my mind I hear the glass bottle shatter on the floor This seems appropriate since I have obviously lost my grip on everything When I wake up I barely get to the toilet before the white liquor makes its reappearance It burns just as much coming up as it did going down and tastes twice as bad Im trembling and sweaty when I finish vomiting but at least most of the stuff is out of my system Enough made itinto my bloodstream though to result in a pounding headache parched mouth and boiling stomach I turn on the shower and stand under the warm rain for a minute before I realize Im still in my underclothes My mother must have just stripped off my filthy outer ones and tucked me in bed I throw the wet undergarments into the sink and pour shampoo on my head My hands sting and thats when I notice the stitches small and even across one palm and up the side of the other hand Vaguely I remember breaking that glass window last night I scrub myself from head to toe only stopping to throw up again right in the shower Its mostly just bile and goes down the drain with the sweetsmelling bubbles Finally clean I pull on my robe and head back to bed ignoring my dripping hair I climb under the blankets sure this is what it must feel like to be poisoned The footsteps on the stairs renew my panic from last nightIm not ready to see my mother and Prim I have to pull myself together to be calm and reassuring the way Iwas when we said our goodbyes the day of the last reaping I have to be strong I struggle into an upright position push my wet hair off my throbbing temples and brace myself for this meeting They appear in the doorway holding tea and toast their faces filled with concern I open my mouth planning to start off with some kind of joke and burst into tears So much for being strong My mother sits on the side of the bed and Prim crawls right up next to me and they hold me making quiet soothing sounds until I am mostly cried out Then Prim gets a towel and dries my hair combing out the knots while my mother coaxes tea and toast into me They dress me in warm pajamas and layer more blankets on me and I drift off again I can tell by thelight its late afternoon when I come round again Theres a glass of water on my bedside table and I gulp it down thirstily My stomach and head stillfeel rocky but much better than they did earlier I rise dress and braid back my hair Before I go down I pause at the top of the stairs feeling slightly embarrassed about the way Ive handled the news of the Quarter Quell My erratic flight drinking with Haymitch weeping Given the circumstances I guess I deserve one day of indulgence Im glad the cameras werent here for it though Downstairs my mother and Prim embrace me again but theyre not overly emotional I know theyre holding things in to make it easier on me Looking at Prims face its hard to imagine shes the same frail little girl I left behind on reaping day nine months ago The combination of that ordeal and all that hasfollowedthe cruelty in the district the parade of sick and wounded that she often treats by herself now if my mothers hands are too full  these things have aged her years Shes grown quite a bit too were practically the same height now but that isnt what makes her seem so much older My mother ladles out a mug of broth for me and I ask for a second mug to take to Haymitch Then I walk across the lawn to his house Hes only just waking up and accepts the mug without comment We sit there almost peacefully sipping our broth and watching the sun set through his living room window I hear someone walking around upstairs and I assume its Hazelle but a few minutes later Peeta comes down and tosses a cardboard box of empty liquor bottles on the table with finality There its done he says Its taking all of Haymitchs resources to focus his eyes on the bottles so I speak up Whats done Ive poured all the liquor downthe drain says Peeta This seems to jolt Haymitch out of his stupor and he paws through the box in disbelief You what I tossed the lot says Peeta Hell just buy more I say No he wont says Peeta I tracked down Ripper this morning and told her Id turn her in the second she sold to either of you I paid her off too just for good measure but I dont think shes eager to be back in the Peacekeepers custody Haymitch takes a swipe with his knife but Peeta deflects it so easily its pathetic Anger rises up in me What business is it of yours what he does Its completely my business However it falls out two of us are going to be in the arena again with the other as mentor We cant afford any drunkards on this team Especially not you Katniss says Peeta to me What I sputter indignantly It would be more convincing if I werent still so hungover Last nights the only time Ive ever even been drunk Yeah and look at theshape youre in says Peeta I dont know what I expected from my first meeting with Peeta after the announcement A few hugs and kisses A little comfort maybe Not this I turn to Haymitch Dont worry Ill get you more liquor Then Ill turn you both in Let you sober up in the stocks says Peeta Whats thepoint to this asks Haymitch The point is that two of us are coming home from the Capitol One mentor and one victor says Peeta Effies sending me recordings of all the living victors Were going to watch their Games and learn everything we can about how they fight Were going to put on weight and get strong Were going to start acting like Careers And one of us is going to be victor again whether you two like it or not He sweeps out of the room slamming the front door Haymitch and I wince at the bang I dontlike selfrighteous people I say Whats to like says Haymitch who begins sucking the dregs out of the empty bottles You and me Thats who he plans on coming home I say Well then the jokes on him says Haymitch But after a few days we agree to act like Careers because this is the best way to get Peeta ready as well Every night we watch the old recaps of the Games that the remaining victors won I realize we never met any of them on the Victory Tour which seems odd in retrospect When I bring it up Haymitch says the last thing President Snow wouldve wanted was to show Peeta and meespecially me  bonding with other victors in potentially rebellious districts Victors have a special status and if they appeared to be supporting my defiance of the Capitol it wouldve been dangerous politically Adjusting for age I realize some of our opponents may be elderly which is both sad and reassuring Peeta takes copious notesHaymitch volunteers information about the victors personalities and slowly we begin to know our competition Every morning we do exercises to strengthen our bodies We run and lift things and stretch our muscles Every afternoon we work on combat skills throwing knives fighting hand to hand I even teach them to climb trees Officially tributes arent supposed to train but no one tries to stop us Even in regular years the tributes from Districts   and  show up able to wield spears and swords This is nothing by comparison After all the years of abuse Haymitchs body resists improvement Hes still remarkably strong but the shortest run winds him And youd think a guy who sleeps every night with a knife might actually be able to hit the side of a house with one but his hands shake so badly it takes weeks for him to achieve even that Peeta and I excel under the new regimen though It gives me something to do Itgives us all something to do besides accept defeat My mother puts us on a special diet to gain weight Prim treats our sore muscles Madge sneaks us her fathers Capitol newspapers Predictions on who will be victor of the victors show us among the favorites Even Gale steps into the picture on Sundays although hes got no love for Peeta or Haymitch and teaches us all he knows about snares Its weird for me being in conversations with both Peeta and Gale but they seem to have set aside whatever issues they have about meOne night as Im walking Gale back into town he even admits Itd be better if he were easier to hate Tell me about it I say If I couldve just hated him in the arena we all wouldnt be in this mess now Hed be dead and Id be a happy little victor all by myself And where would we beKatniss asks Gale I pause not knowing what to say Where would I be with my pretend cousin who wouldnt be my cousin if it werent for Peeta Would he have still kissed me and would I have kissed him back had I been free to do so Would I have let myself open up to him lulled by the security of money and food and the illusion of safety being a victor could bring under different circumstances But there would still always be the reaping looming over us over our children No matter what I wanted  Hunting Like every Sunday I say I know he didnt mean the question literally but this is as much as I can honestly give Gale knows I chose him over Peeta when I didnt make a run for it To me theres no point in talking about things that might have been Even if I had killed Peeta in the arena I still wouldnt have wanted to marry anyone I only got engaged to save peoples lives and that completely backfired Im afraid anyway that any kindof emotional scene with Gale might cause him to do something drastic Like start that uprising in the mines And as Haymitch says District  isnt ready for that If anything theyre less ready than before the Quarter Quell announcement because the following morning another hundred Peacekeepers arrived on the train Since I dont plan on making it back alive a second time the sooner Gale lets me go the better I do plan on saying one or two things to him after the reaping when were allowed an hour for goodbyes To let Gale know how essential hes been to me all these years How much better my life has been for knowing him For loving him even if its only in the limited way that I can manage But I never get the chance The day of the reapings hot and sultry The population of District  waits sweating and silent in the square with machine guns trained on them I stand alone in a small ropedoff area with Peetaand Haymitch in a similar pen to the right of me The reaping takes only a minute Effie shining in a wig of metallic gold lacks her usual verve She has to claw around the girls reaping ball for quite a while to snag the one piece of paper that everyone already knows has my name on it Then she catches Haymitchs name He barely has time to shoot me an unhappy look before Peeta has volunteered to take his place We are immediately marched into the Justice Building to find Head Peacekeeper Thread waiting for us New procedure he says with a smile Were ushered out the back door into a car and taken to the train station There are no cameras on the platform no crowd to send us on our way Haymitch and Effie appear escorted by guardsPeacekeepers hurry us all onto the train and slam the door The wheels begin to turn And Im left staring out thewindow watching District  disappear with all my goodbyes still hanging on my lips I remain at the window long after the woods have swallowed up the last glimpse of my home This time I dont have even the slightest hope of return Before my first Games I promised Prim I would do everything I could to win and now Ive sworn to myself to do all I can to keep Peeta alive I will never reverse this journey again Id actually figured out what I wanted my last words to my loved ones to be How best to close and lock the doors and leave them sad but safely behind And now the Capitol has stolen that as well Well write letters Katniss says Peeta from behind me It will be better anyway Give them a piece of us to hold on to Haymitch will deliver them for us if  they need to be delivered I nod and go straight to my room I sit on the bed knowing I will never write those letters They will be like the speech I tried to write tohonor Rue and Thresh in District  Things seemed clear in my head and even when I talked before the crowd but the words never came out of the pen right Besides they were meant to go with embraces and kisses and a stroke of Prims hair a caress of Gales face a squeeze of Madges hand They cannot be delivered with a wooden box containing my cold stiff body Too heartsick to cry all I want is to curl up on the bed and sleep until we arrive in the Capitol tomorrow morning But I have a mission No its more than a mission Its my dying wish Keep Peeta alive And as unlikely as it seems that I can achieve it in the face of the Capitols anger its important that I be at the top of my game This wont happen if Im mourning for everyone I love back home Let them go I tell myself Say goodbye and forget them I do my best thinking of them one by one releasing them like birds from the protective cages inside me locking the doorsagainst their return By the time Effie knocks on my door to call me to dinner Im empty But the lightness isnt entirely unwelcome The meals subdued So subdued in fact that there are long periods of silence relieved only by the removal of old dishes and presentation of new ones A cold soup of pureed vegetables Fish cakes with creamy lime paste Those little birds filled with orange sauce with wild rice and watercress Chocolate custard dotted with cherries Peeta and Effie make occasional attempts at conversation that quickly die out I love your new hair Effie Peeta says Thank you I had it especially done to match Katnisss pin I was thinking we might get you a golden ankle band and maybe find Haymitch a gold bracelet or something so we could all look like a team says Effie Evidently Effie doesnt know that my mockingjay pin is now a symbol used by the rebels At least in District  In the Capitolthe mockingjay is still a fun reminder of an especially exciting Hunger Games What else could it be Real rebels dont put a secret symbol on something as durable as jewelry They put it on a wafer of bread that can be eaten in a second if necessary I think thats a great idea says Peeta How about it Haymitch Yeah whatever says Haymitch Hes not drinking but I can tell hed like to be Effie had them take her own wine away when she saw the effort he was making but hes in a miserable state If he were the tribute he would have owed Peeta nothing and could be as drunk as he liked Now its going to take all hes got to keepPeeta alive in an arena full of his old friends and hell probably fail Maybe we could get you a wig too I say in an attempt at lightness He just shoots me a look that says to leave him alone and we all eat our custard in silence Shallwe watch the recap of the reapings says Effie dabbing at the corners of her mouth with a white linen napkin Peeta goes off to retrieve his notebook on the remaining living victors and we gather in the compartment with the television to see who our competition will be in the arena We are all in place as the anthem begins to play and the annual recap of the reaping ceremonies in the twelve districts begins In the history of the Games there have been seventyfive victors Fiftynine are still alive I recognize many of their faces either from seeing them as tributes or mentors at previous Games or from our recent viewing of the victors tapes Some are so old or wasted by illness drugs or drink that I cant place them As one would expect the pools of Career tributes from Districts   and  are the largest But every district has managed to scrape up at least one female and one male victor The reapings go by quicklyPeeta studiously puts stars by the names of the chosen tributes in his notebook Haymitch watches his face devoid of emotion as friends of his step up to take the stage Effie makes hushed distressed comments like Oh not Cecelia or Well Chaff never could stay out of a fight and sighs frequently For my part I try to make some mental record of the other tributes but like last year only a few really stick in my head Theres the classically beautiful brother and sister from District  who were victors in consecutive years when I was little Brutus a volunteer from District  who must be at least forty and apparently cant wait to get back in the arena Finnick the handsome bronzehaired guy from District  who was crowned ten years ago at the age of fourteen A hysterical young woman with flowing brown hair is also called from  but shes quickly replaced by a volunteer an eightyyearold woman who needs a cane to walk to thestage Then theres Johanna Mason the only living female victor from  who won a few years back by pretending she was a weakling The woman from  who Effie calls Cecelia who looks about thirty has to detach herself from the three kids who run up to cling to her Chaff a man from  who I know to be one of Haymitchs particular friends is also in Im called Then Haymitch And Peeta volunteers One of the announcers actually gets teary because it seems the odds will never be in our favor we starcrossed lovers of District  Then she pulls herself together to say she bets that these will be the best Games ever Haymitch leaves the compartment without a word and Effie after making a few unconnected comments about this tribute or that bids us good night I just sit there watching Peeta rip out the pages ofthe victors who were not picked Why dont you get some sleep he says Because I cant handle the nightmares Not without you I think They are sure to be dreadful tonight But I can hardly ask Peeta to come sleep with me Weve barely touched since that night Gale was whipped What are you going to do I ask Just review my notes awhile Get a clear picture of what were up against But Ill go over it with you in the morning Go to bed Katniss he says So I go to bed and sure enough within a few hours I awake from a nightmare where that old woman from District  transforms into a large rodent and gnaws on my face I know I was screaming but no one comes Not Peeta not even one of the Capitol attendants I pull on a robe to try to calm the gooseflesh crawling over my body Staying in my compartment is impossible so I decide to go find someone to make me tea or hot chocolate or anything MaybeHaymitch is still up Surely he isnt asleep I order warm milk the most calming thing I can think of from an attendant Hearing voices from the television room I go in and find Peeta Beside him on the couch is the box Effie sent of tapes of the old Hunger Games I recognize the episode in which Brutus became victor Peeta rises and flips off the tape when he sees me Couldnt sleep Not for long I say I pull the robe more securely around me as I remember the old woman transforming into the rodent Want to talk about it he asks Sometimes that can help but I just shake my head feeling weak that people I havent even fought yet already haunt me When Peeta holds out his arms I walk straight into them Its the first time since they announced the Quarter Quell that hes offered me any sort of affection Hes been more like a very demanding trainer always pushing always insisting Haymitch and I run faster eat more knowour enemy better Lover Forget about that He abandoned any pretense of even being my friend I wrap my arms tightly around his neck before he can order me to do pushups or something Instead he pulls me in close and buries his face in my hair Warmth radiates from the spot where his lips just touch my neck slowly spreading through the rest of me It feels so good so impossibly good that I know I will not be the first to let go And why should I I have said goodbye to Gale Ill never see him again thats for certain Nothing I do now can hurt him He wont see it or hell think I am acting for the cameras That at least is one weight off my shoulders The arrival of the Capitol attendant with the warm milk is what breaks us apart He sets a tray with a steaming ceramic jug and two mugs on a table I brought an extra cup he says Thanks I say And I added a touch of honey to the milk For sweetness And just a pinchof spice he adds He looks at us like he wants to say more then gives his head a slight shake and backs out of the room Whats withhim I say I think he feels bad for us says Peeta Right I say pouring the milk I mean it I dont think the people in the Capitol are going to be all that happy about our going back in says Peeta Or the other victors They get attached to their champions Im guessing theyll get over it once the blood starts flowing I say flatly Really if theres one thing I dont have time for its worrying about how the Quarter Quell will affect the mood in the Capitol So youre watching all the tapes again Not really Just sort of skipping around to see peoples different fighting techniques says Peeta Whos next I ask You pick says Peeta holding out the box The tapes are marked with theyear of the Games and the name of the victor I dig around and suddenly find one in my hand that we have not watched The year of the Games is fifty That would make it the second Quarter Quell And the name of the victor is Haymitch Abernathy We never watched this one I say Peeta shakes his head No I knew Haymitch didnt want to The same way we didnt want to relive our own Games And since were all on the same team I didnt think it mattered much Is the person who won in twentyfive in here I ask I dont think so Whoever it was must be dead by now and Effie only sent me victors we might have to face Peeta weighs Haymitchs tape in his hand Why You think we ought to watch it Its the only Quell we have We might pick up something valuable about how they work I say But I feel weird It seems like some major invasion of Haymitchs privacy I dont know why it should since the whole thingwas public But it does I have to admit Im also extremely curious We dont have to tell Haymitch we saw it Okay Peeta agrees He puts in the tape and I curl up next to him on the couch with my milk which is really delicious with the honey and spices and lose myself in the Fiftieth Hunger Games After the anthem they show President Snow drawing the envelope for the second Quarter Quell He looks younger but just as repellent He reads from the square of paper in the same onerous voice he used for ours informing Panem that in honor of the Quarter Quell there will be twice the number of tributes The editors smash cut right into the reapings where name after name after name is called By the time we get to District  Im completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of kids going to certain death Theres a woman not Effie calling the names in  but she still begins with Ladies first She callsout the name of a girl whos from the Seam you can tell by the look of her and then I hear the name Maysilee Donner Oh I say She was my mothers friend The camera finds her in the crowd clinging to two other girls All blond All definitely merchants kids I think thats your mother hugging her says Peeta quietly And hes right As Maysilee Donnerbravely disengages herself and heads for the stage I catch a glimpse of my mother at my age and no one has exaggerated her beauty Holding her hand and weeping is another girl who looks just like Maysilee But a lot like someone else I know too Madge I say Thats her mother She and Maysilee were twins or something Peeta says My dad mentioned it once I think of Madges mother Mayor Undersees wife Who spends half her life in bed immobilizedwith terrible pain shutting out the world I think of how I never realized that she and my mother shared this connection Of Madge showing up in that snowstorm to bring the painkiller for Gale Of my mockingjay pin and how it means something completely different now that I know that its former owner was Madges aunt Maysilee Donner a tribute who was murdered in the arena Haymitchs name is called last of all Its more of a shock to see him than my mother Young Strong Hard to admit but he was something of a looker His hair dark and curly those gray Seam eyes bright and even then dangerous Oh Peeta you dont think he killed Maysilee do you I burst out I dont know why but I cant stand the thought With fortyeight players Id say the odds are against it says Peeta The chariot rides  in which the District  kids are dressed in awful coal miners outfits  and the interviews flash by Theres little time tofocus on anyone But since Haymitch is going to be the victor we get to see one full exchange between him and Caesar Flickerman who looks exactly as he always does in his twinkling midnight blue suit Only his dark green hair eyelids and lips are different So Haymitch what do you think of the Games having one hundred percent more competitors than usual asks Caesar Haymitch shrugs I dont see that it makes much difference Theyll still be one hundred percent as stupid as usual so I figure my odds will be roughly the same The audience bursts out laughing and Haymitch gives them a half smile Snarky Arrogant Indifferent He didnt have to reach far for that did he I say Now its the morning the Games begin We watch from the point of view of one of the tributes as she rises up through the tube from the Launch Room and into the arena I cant help but give a slight gasp Disbelief is reflected on thefaces of the players Even Haymitchs eyebrows lift in pleasure although they almost immediately knit themselves back into a scowl Its the most breathtaking place imaginable The golden Cornucopia sits in the middle of a green meadow with patches of gorgeous flowers The sky is azure blue with puffy white clouds Bright songbirds flutter overhead By the way some of the tributes are sniffing it must smell fantastic An aerial shot shows that the meadow stretches for miles Far in the distance in one direction there seems to be a woods in the other a snowcapped mountain The beauty disorientsmany of the players because when the gong sounds most of them seem like theyre trying to wake from a dream Not Haymitch though Hes at the Cornucopia armed with weapons and a backpack of choice supplies He heads for thewoods before most of the others have stepped off their platesEighteen tributes are killed in the bloodbath that first day Others begin to die off and it becomes clear that almost everything in this pretty placethe luscious fruit dangling from the bushes the water in the crystalline streams even the scent of the flowers when inhaled too directlyis deadly poisonous Only the rainwater and the food provided at the Cornucopia are safe to consume Theres also a large wellstocked Career pack of ten tributes scouring the mountain area for victims Haymitch has his own troubles over in the woods where the fluffy golden squirrels turn out to be carnivorous and attack in packs and the butterfly stings bring agony if not death But he persists in moving forward always keeping the distant mountain at his backMaysilee Donner turns out to be pretty resourceful herself for a girl who leaves the Cornucopia with only a small backpack Inside she finds a bowl some dried beef and a blowgun with two dozen darts Making use of the readily available poisons she soon turns the blowgun into a deadly weapon by dipping the darts in lethal substances and directing them into her opponents flesh Four days in the picturesque mountain erupts in a volcano that wipes out another dozen players including all but five of the Career pack With the mountain spewing liquid fire and the meadow offering no means of concealment the remaining thirteen tributes  including Haymitch and Maysilee  have no choice but to confine themselves to the woods Haymitch seems bent on continuing in the same direction away from the now volcanic mountain but a maze of tightly woven hedges forces him to circle back into the center of thewoods where he encounters three of the Careers and pulls his knife They may be much bigger and stronger but Haymitch has remarkable speed and has killed two when the third disarms him That Career is about to slit his throat when a dart drops him to the ground Maysilee Donner steps out of the woods Wed live longer with two of us Guess you just proved that says Haymitch rubbing his neck Allies Maysilee nods And there they are instantly drawn into one of those pacts youd be hard pressed to break if you ever expect to go home and face your district Just like Peeta and me they do better together Get more rest work out a system to salvage more rainwater fight as a team and share the food from the dead tributes packs But Haymitch is still determined to keep moving on Why Maysilee keeps asking and he ignores her until she refuses to move any farther without an answer Because it has to endsomewhere right says Haymitch The arena cant go on forever What do you expect to find Maysilee asks I dont know But maybe theres something we can use he says When they finally do make it through that impossible hedge using a blowtorch from one of the dead Careers packs they find themselves on flat dry earth that leads to acliff Far below you can see jagged rocks Thats all there is Haymitch Lets go back says Maysilee No Im staying here he says All right Theres only five of us left May as well say goodbye now anyway she says I dont want it to come down to you and me Okay he agrees Thats all He doesnt offer to shake her hand or even look at her And she walks away Haymitch skirts along the edge of the cliff as if trying to figure something out His foot dislodges a pebble and it falls into the abyss apparentlygone forever But a minute later as he sits to rest the pebble shoots back up beside him Haymitch stares at it puzzled and then his face takes on a strange intensity He lobs a rock the size of his fist over the cliff and waits When it flies back out and right into his hand he starts laughing Thats when we hear Maysilee begin to scream The alliance is over and she broke it off so no one could blame him for ignoring her But Haymitch runs for her anyway He arrives only in time to watch the last of a flock of candy pink birds equipped with long thin beaks skewer her through the neck He holds her hand while she dies and all I can think of is Rue and how I was too late to save her too Later that day another tribute is killed in combat and a third gets eaten by a pack of those fluffy squirrels leaving Haymitch and a girl from District  to vie for the crown Shes bigger than he is and just as fast and when the inevitable fight comes itsbloody and awful and both have received what could well be fatal wounds when Haymitch is finally disarmed He staggers through the beautiful woods holding his intestines in while she stumbles after him carrying the ax that should deliver his deathblow Haymitch makes a beeline for his cliff and has just reached the edge when she throws the ax He collapses on the ground and it flies into the abyss Now weaponless as well the girl just stands there trying to staunch the flow of blood pouring from her empty eye socket Shes thinking perhaps that she can outlast Haymitch whos starting to convulse on the ground But what she doesnt know and what he does is that the ax will return And when it flies back over the ledge it buries itself in her head The cannon sounds her body is removed and the trumpets blow to announce Haymitchs victory Peeta clicks off the tape and we sit there in silence for a while FinallyPeeta says That force field at the bottom of the cliff it was like the one on the roof of the Training Center The one that throws you back if you try to jump off and commit suicide Haymitch found a way to turn it into a weapon Not just against the other tributes but the Capitol too I say You know they didnt expect that to happen It wasnt meant to be part of the arena They never planned on anyone using it as a weapon It made them look stupid that he figured it out I bet they had a good time trying tospin that one Bet thats why I dont remember seeing it on television Its almost as bad as us and the berries I cant help laughing really laughing for the first time in months Peeta just shakes his head like Ive lost my mindand maybe I have a little Almost but not quite says Haymitch from behind us I whip around afraid hes going to be angry overus watching his tape but he just smirks and takes a swig from a bottle of wine So much for sobriety I guess I should be upset hes drinking again but Im preoccupied with another feeling Ive spent all these weeks getting to know who my competitors are without even thinking about who my teammates are Now a new kind of confidence is lighting up inside of me because I think I finally know who Haymitch is And Im beginning to know who I am And surely two people who have caused the Capitol so much trouble can think of a way to get Peeta home alive Having been through prep with Flavius Venia and Octavia numerous times it should just be an old routine to survive But I havent anticipated the emotional ordeal that awaits me At some point during the prep each of them bursts into tears at least twice and Octavia pretty much keeps up a running whimper throughout the morning It turns out theyreally have become attached to me and the idea of my returning to the arena has undone them Combine that with the fact that by losing me theyll be losing their ticket to all kinds of big social events particularly my wedding and the whole thing becomes unbearable The idea of being strong for someone else having never entered their heads I find myself in the position of having to console them Since Im the person going in to be slaughtered this is somewhat annoying Its interesting though when I think of what Peeta said about the attendant on the train being unhappy about the victors having to fight again About people in the Capitol not liking it I still think all of that will be forgotten once the gong sounds but its something of a revelation that those in the Capitol feel anything at all about us They certainly dont have a problem watching children murdered every year But maybe they know too much about the victors especially theones whove been celebrities for ages to forget were human beings Its more like watching your own friends die More like the Games are for those of us in the districts By the time Cinna shows up I am irritable and exhausted from comforting the prep team especially because their constant tears are reminding me of the ones undoubtedly being shed at home Standing there in my thin robe with my stinging skin and heart I know I cant bear even one more look of regret So the moment he walks in the door I snap I swear if you cry Ill kill you here and now Cinna just smiles Had a damp morning You could wring me out I reply Cinna puts his arm around my shoulder and leads me into lunch Dont worry Ialways channel my emotions into my work That way I dont hurt anyone but myself I cant go through that againI warn him I know Ill talk to them says Cinna Lunch makes me feel a bit better Pheasant with a selection of jewelcolored jellies and tiny versions of real vegetables swimming in butter and potatoes mashed with parsley For dessert we dip chunks of fruit in a pot of melted chocolate and Cinna has to order a second pot because I start just eating the stuff with a spoon So what are we wearing for the opening ceremonies I finally ask as I scrape the second pot clean Headlamps or fire I know the chariot ride will require Peeta and me to be dressed in something coal related Something along that line he says When its time to get in costume for the opening ceremonies my prep team shows up but Cinna sends them away saying theyve done such a spectacular job in the morning theres nothing left to do They go off to recover thankfully leaving me in Cinnas hands He puts up my hair first in the braided style mymother introduced him to then proceeds with my makeup Last year he used little so that the audience would recognize me when I landed in the arena But now my face is almost obscured by the dramatic highlights and dark shadows High arching eyebrows sharp cheekbones smoldering eyes deep purple lips The costume looks deceptively simple at first just a fitted black jumpsuit that covers me from the neck down He places a half crown like the one I received as victor on my head but its made of a heavy black metal not gold Then he adjusts the light in the room to mimic twilight and presses a button just inside the fabric on my wrist I look down fascinated as my ensemble slowly comes to life first with a soft golden light but gradually transforming to the orangered of burning coal I look as if I have been coated in glowing embers  no that I am a glowing ember straight from our fireplace The colorsrise and fall shift and blend in exactly the way the coals do How did you do this I say in wonder Portia and I spent a lot of hours watching fires says Cinna Now look at yourself He turns me toward a mirror so that I can take in the entire effect I do not see a girl or even a woman but some unearthly being who looks like she might make her home in the volcano that destroyed so many in Haymitchs Quell The black crown which now appears redhot casts strange shadows on my dramatically madeup face Katniss the girl on fire has left behind her flickering flames and bejeweled gowns and soft candlelight frocks She is as deadly as fire itself I think  this is just what I needed to face the others I say Yes I think your days of pink lipstick and ribbons are behind you says Cinna He touches the button on my wrist again extinguishing my light Lets not run down your power pack When youre on the chariot thistime no waving no smilingI just want you to look straight ahead as if the entire audience is beneath your notice Finally something Ill be good at I say Cinna has a few more things to attend to so I decide to head down to the ground floor of the Remake Center which houses the huge gathering place for the tributes and their chariots before the opening ceremonies Im hoping to find Peeta and Haymitch but they havent arrived yet Unlike last year when all the tributes were practically glued to their chariots the scene is very social The victors both this years tributes and their mentors are standing around in small groups talking Of course they all know one another and I dont know anyone and Im not really the sort of person to go around introducing myself So I just stroke the neck of one of my horses and try not to benoticed It doesnt work The crunching hits my ear before I even know hes beside me and when I turn my head Finnick Odairs famous sea green eyes are only inches from mine He pops a sugar cube in his mouth and leans against my horseHello Katniss he says as if weve known each other for years when in fact weve never met Hello Finnick I say just as casually although Im feeling uncomfortable at his closeness especially since hes got so much bare skin exposed Want a sugar cube he says offering his hand which is piled high Theyre supposed to be for the horses but who cares Theyve got years to eat sugar whereas you and I  well if we see something sweet we better grab it quick Finnick Odair is something of a living legend in Panem Since he won the Sixtyfifth Hunger Games when he was only fourteen hes still one of the youngest victorsBeing from District  he was a Career so the odds were already in his favor but what no trainer could claim to have given him was his extraordinary beauty Tall athletic with golden skin and bronzecolored hair and those incredible eyes While other tributes that year were hardpressed to get a handful of grain or some matches for a gift Finnick never wanted for anything not food or medicine or weapons It took about a week for his competitors to realize that he was the one to kill but it was too late He was already a good fighter with the spears and knives he had found in the Cornucopia When he received a silver parachute with a tridentwhich may be the most expensive gift Ive ever seen given in the arenait was all over District s industry is fishing Hed been on boats his whole life The trident was a natural deadly extension of his arm He wove a net out of some kind of vine he found used it to entangle his opponentsso he could spear them with the trident and within a matter of days the crown was his The citizens of the Capitol have been drooling over him ever since Because of his youth they couldnt really touch him for the first year or two But ever since he turned sixteen hes spent his time at the Games being dogged by those desperately in love with him No one retains his favor for long He can go through four or five in his annual visit Old or young lovely or plain rich or very rich hell keep them company and take their extravagant gifts but he never stays and once hes gone he never comes back I cant argue that Finnick isnt one of the most stunning sensuous people on the planet But I can honestly say hes never been attractive to me Maybe hes too pretty or maybe hes too easy to get or maybe its really that hed just be too easy to lose No thanks I say to the sugar Id love to borrow your outfit sometime thoughHes draped in a golden net thats strategically knotted at his groin so that he cant technically be called naked but hes about as close as you can get Im sure his stylist thinks the more of Finnick the audience sees the better Youre absolutely terrifying me in that getup What happened to the pretty littlegirl dresses he asks He wets his lips just ever so slightly with his tongue Probably thisdrives most people crazy But for some reason all I can think of is old Cray salivating over some poor starving young woman I outgrew them I say Finnick takes the collar of my outfit and runs it between his fingers Its too bad about this Quell thing You could have made out like a bandit in the Capitol Jewels money anything you wanted I dont like jewels and I have more money than I need What do you spend all yours on anyway Finnick I sayOh I havent dealt in anything as common as money for years says Finnick Then how do they pay you for the pleasure of your company I ask With secrets he says softly He tips his head in so his lips are almost in contact with mine What about you girl on fire Do you have any secrets worth my time For some stupid reason I blush but I force myself to hold my ground No Im an open book I whisper back Everybody seems to know my secrets before I know them myself He smiles Unfortunately I think thats true His eyes flicker off to the side Peeta is coming Sorry you have to cancel your wedding I know how devastating that must be for you He tosses another sugar cube in his mouth and saunters off Peetas beside me dressed in an outfit identical to mine What did Finnick Odair want he asks I turn and put my lips close to Peetas and drop my eyelids in imitation of Finnick He offered me sugar andwanted to know all my secrets I say in my best seductive voice Peeta laughs Ugh Not really Really I say Ill tell you more when my skin stops crawling Do you think wed have ended up like this if only one of us had won he asks glancing around at the other victors Just another part of the freak show Sure Especially you I say Oh And why especially me he says with a smile Because you have a weakness for beautiful things and I dont I say with an air of superiority They would lure you into their Capitol ways and youd be lost entirely Having an eye for beauty isnt the same thing as a weakness Peeta points out Except possibly when it comes to you The music is beginning and I see the wide doors opening for the first chariot hear the roar of the crowd Shall we He holds out a hand to help me into the chariot I climb up and pull him up after me Hold still I say and straighten his crown Have you seen your suitturned on Were going to be fabulous again Absolutely But Portia says were to be very above it all No waving or anything he says Where are they anyway I dont know I eye the procession of chariots Maybe we better go ahead and switch ourselves on We do and as we begin to glow I can see people pointing at us and chattering and I know that once again well be the talk of the opening ceremonies Were almost at the door I crane my head around but neither Portia nor Cinna who were with us right up to the final second last yearare anywhere in sight Are we supposed to hold hands this year I ask I guess theyve left it up to us says Peeta I look up into those blue eyes that no amount of dramatic makeup can make truly deadly and remember how just a year ago I was prepared to kill him Convinced he was tryingto kill me Now everything is reversed Im determined to keep him alive knowing the cost will be my own life but the part of me that is not so brave as I could wish is glad that its Peeta not Haymitch beside me Our hands find each other without further discussion Of course we will go into this as one The voice of the crowd rises into one universal scream as we roll into the fading evening light but neither one of us reacts I simply fix my eyes on a point far in the distance and pretend there is no audience no hysteria I cant help catching glimpses of us on the huge screens along the route and we are not just beautiful we are dark and powerful No more We starcrossed lovers from District  who suffered so much and enjoyed so little the rewards of our victory do not seek the fans favor grace them with our smiles or catch their kisses We are unforgiving And I love it Getting to be myself at last As we curve around into theloop of the City Circle I can see that a couple of the other stylists have tried to steal Cinna and Portias idea of illuminating their tributes The electriclightstudded outfits from District  where they make electronics at least make sense But what are the livestock keepers from District  who are dressed as cows doing with flaming belts Broiling themselves Pathetic Peeta and I on the other hand are so mesmerizing with our everchanging coal costumes that most of the other tributes are staring at us We seem particularly riveting to the pair from District  who are known morphling addicts Both bone thin with sagging yellowish skin They cant tear their overlarge eyes away even when President Snow begins to speak from his balcony welcoming us all to the Quell The anthem plays and as we make our final trip around the circle am I wrong Or do I see the president fixated on me as well Peeta and I wait until thedoors of the Training Center have closed behind us to relax Cinna and Portia are there pleased with our performance and Haymitch has made an appearance this year as well only hes not at our chariot hes over with the tributes of District  I see him nod in our direction and then they follow him over to greet us I know Chaff by sight because Ive spent years watching him pass a bottle back and forth with Haymitch on television Hes dark skinned about six feet tall and one of his arms ends in a stump because he lost his hand in the Games he won thirty years ago Im sure they offered him some artificial replacement like they did Peeta when they had to amputate his lower leg but I guess he didnt take it The woman Seeder looks almost likeshe could be from the Seam with her olive skin and straight black hair streaked with silver Only her goldenbrown eyes mark her as from another district She must be around sixty but she still looks strong and theres no sign shes turned to liquor or morphling or any other chemical form of escape over the years Before either of us says a word she embraces me I know somehow it must be because of Rue and Thresh Before I can stop myself I whisper The families Theyre alive she says back softly before letting me go Chaff throws his good arm around me and gives me a big kiss right on the mouth I jerk back startled while he and Haymitch guffaw Thats about all the time we get before the Capitol attendants are firmly directing us toward the elevators I get the distinct feeling theyre not comfortable with the camaraderie among the victors who couldnt seem to care less As I walk toward the elevators my hand still linked with Peetas someone else rustles up to my side The girl pulls off a headdress of leafy branches andtosses it behind her without bothering to look where it falls Johanna Mason From District  Lumber and paper thus the tree She won by very convincingly portraying herself as weak and helpless so that she would be ignored Then she demonstrated a wicked ability to murder She ruffles up her spiky hair and rolls her wideset brown eyes Isnt my costume awful My stylists the biggest idiot in the Capitol Our tributes have been trees for forty years under her Wish Id gotten Cinna You look fantastic Girl talk That thing Ive always been so bad at Opinions on clothes hair makeup So I lie Yeah hes been helping me design my own clothing line You should see what he can do with velvet Velvet The only fabric I could think of off the top of my head I have On your tour That strapless number you wore in District Two The deep blue one with the diamonds So gorgeous I wanted to reach through the screen and tear itright off your back says Johanna I bet you did I think With a few inches of my flesh While we wait for the elevators Johanna unzips the rest of her tree letting it drop to the floor and then kicks it away in disgust Except for her forest green slippers she doesnt have on a stitch of clothing Thats better We end up on the same elevator with her and she spends the whole ride to the seventh floor chatting to Peeta about his paintings while the light of his stillglowing costume reflects off her bare breasts When she leaves I ignore him but I just know hes grinning I toss aside his hand as the doors close behind Chaff and Seeder leaving us alone and he breaks out laughing What I say turning on him as we step out on our floor Its you Katniss Cant you see he says Whats me I say Why theyre all acting like this Finnick with his sugar cubes and Chaff kissing you and that whole thing with Johanna stripping downHe tries to take on a more serious tone unsuccessfully Theyre playing with you because youre so  you know No I dont know I say And I really have no idea what hes talking about Its like when you wouldnt look at me naked in the arena even though I was half dead Youre so  pure he says finally I am not I say Ive been practically ripping your clothes off every time theres been a camera for the last yearYeah but  I mean for the Capitol youre pure he says clearly trying to mollify me For me youre perfect Theyre just teasing you No theyre laughing at me and so are you I say No Peeta shakes his head but hes still suppressing a smile Im seriously rethinking the question of who should get out of these Games alive when the other elevator opens Haymitch and Effie join us looking pleasedabout something Then Haymitchs face grows hard What did I do now I almost say but I see hes staring behind me at the entrance to the dining room Effie blinks in the same direction then says brightly Looks like theyve got you a matched set this year I turn around and find the redheaded Avox girl who tended to me last year until the Games began I think how nice it is to have a friend here I notice that the young man beside her another Avox also has red hair That must be what Effie meant by a matched set Then a chill runs through me Because I know him too Not from the Capitol but from years of having easy conversations in the Hob joking over Greasy Saes soup and that last day watching him lie unconscious in the square while the life bled out of Gale Our new Avox is Darius Haymitch grips my wrist as if anticipating my next move but I am as speechless as the Capitols torturers haverendered Darius Haymitch once told me they did something to Avoxes tongues so they could never talk again In my head I hear Dariuss voice playful and bright ringing across the Hob to tease me Not as my fellow victors make fun of me now but because we genuinely liked each other If Gale could see him  I know any move I would make toward Darius any act of recognition would only result in punishment for him So we just stare into each others eyes Darius now a mute slave me now headed to death What would we say anyway That were sorry for the others lot That we ache for the others pain That were glad we had the chance to know each other No Darius shouldnt be glad he knew me If I had been there to stop Thread he wouldnt have stepped forward to save Gale Wouldnt be an Avox And more specifically wouldnt be my Avox because President Snow has so obviously had him placed here for mybenefit I twist my wrist from Haymitchs grasp and head down to my old bedroom locking the door behind me I sit on the side of my bed elbows on my knees forehead on my fists and watch my glowing suit in the darkness imagining I am in my old home in District  huddled beside the fire It slowly fades back to black as the power pack dies out When Effie eventually knocks on the door to summon me to dinner I get up and take off my suit fold it neatly and set it on the table with my crown In the bathroom I wash the dark streaks of makeup from my face I dress in a simple shirt and pants and go down the hall to the dining room Im not aware of much at dinner except thatDarius and the redheaded Avox girl are our servers Effie Haymitch Cinna Portia and Peeta are all there talking about the opening ceremonies I suppose But the only timeI really feel present is when I purposely knock a dish of peas to the floor and before anyone can stop me crouch down to clean them up Darius is right by me when I send the dish over and we two are briefly side by side obscured from view as we scoop up the peas For just one moment our hands meet I can feel his skin rough under the buttery sauce from the dish In the tight desperate clench of our fingers are all the words we will never be able to say Then Effies clucking at me from behind about how That isnt your job Katniss and he lets go When we go in to watch the recap of the opening ceremonies I wedge myself in between Cinna and Haymitch on the couch because I dont want to be next to Peeta This awfulness with Darius belongs to me and Gale and maybe even Haymitch but not to Peeta He mightve known Darius to nod hello but Peeta wasnt Hob the way the rest of us were Besides Im still angry with him forlaughing at me along with the other victors and the last thing I want is his sympathy and comfort I havent changed my mind about saving him in the arena but I dont owe him more than that As I watch the procession to the City Circle I think how its bad enough that they dress us all up in costumes and parade us through the streets in chariots on a regular year Kids in costumes are silly but aging victors it turns out are pitiful A few who are on the younger side like Johanna and Finnick or whose bodies havent fallen into disrepair like Seeder and Brutus can still manage to maintain a little dignity But the majority who are in the clutches of drink or morphling or illness look grotesque in their costumes depicting cows and trees and loaves of bread Last year we chattered away about each contestant but tonight theres only the occasional comment Small wonder the crowd goes wild when Peeta and I appearlooking so young and strong and beautiful in our brilliant costumes The very image of what tributes should be As soon as its over I stand up and thank Cinna and Portia for their amazing work and head off to bed Effie calls a reminder to meet early for breakfast to work out our training strategy but even her voice sounds hollow Poor Effie She finally had a decent year in the Games with Peeta and me and now its all broken down into a mess that even she cant put a positive spin on In Capitol terms Im guessing this counts as a true tragedy Soon after I go to bed theres a quiet knock on my door but I ignore it I dont want Peeta tonight Especially not with Darius around Its almost as bad as if Gale were here Gale How am I supposed to let him go with Darius haunting the hallways Tongues figure prominently in my nightmares First I watch frozen and helpless while gloved hands carry out the bloodydissection in Dariuss mouth Then Im at a party where everyone wears masks and someone with a flicking wet tongue who I suppose is Finnick stalks me but when he catches me and pulls off his mask its President Snow and his puffy lips are dripping in bloody saliva Finally Im back in the arena my own tongue as dry as sandpaper while I try to reach a pool of water that recedes every time Im about to touch it When I wake I stumble to the bathroom and gulp water from the faucet until I can hold no more I strip off my sweaty clothes and fall back into bed naked and somehow find sleep again I delay going down to breakfast as long as possible the next morning because I really dont want to discuss our training strategy Whats to discuss Every victor already knows what everybody else can do Or used to be able to do anyway So Peeta and I will continue to act in love and thats that Somehow Im just not up to talkingabout it especially with Darius standing mutely by I take a long shower dress slowly in the outfit Cinna has left for training and order food from the menu in my room by speaking into a mouthpiece In a minute sausage eggs potatoes bread juice and hot chocolate appear I eat my fill trying to drag out the minutes until ten oclock when we have to go down to the Training Center By ninethirty Haymitch is pounding on my door obviously fed up with me ordering me to the dining room NOW Still I brush my teeth before meandering down the hall effectively killing another five minutes The dining rooms empty except for Peeta and Haymitch whose face is flushed with drink and anger On his wrist he wears a solidgold bangle with a pattern of flames  this must be his concession to Effies matchingtoken plan  that he twists unhappily Its a very handsome bangle really but the movement makes it seemlike something confining a shackle rather than a piece of jewelry Youre late he snarls at me Sorry I slept in after the mutilatedtongue nightmares kept me up half the night I mean to sound hostile but my voice catches at the end of the sentence Haymitch gives me a scowl then relents All right never mind Today in training youve got two jobs One stay in love Obviously I say And two make some friends says Haymitch No I say I dont trust any of them I cant stand most of them and Id rather operate with just the two of us Thats what I said at first but Peeta begins But it wont be enough Haymitch insists Youre going to need more allies this time around Why I ask Because youre at a distinct disadvantage Your competitors have known each other for years So who do you think theyre going to target first he says Us And nothing were going to do is going to override any oldfriendship I say So why bother Because you can fight Youre popular with the crowd That could still make you desirable allies Butonly if you let the others know youre willing to team up with them says Haymitch You mean you want us in the Career pack this year I ask unable to hide my distaste Traditionally the tributes from Districts   and  join forces possibly taking in a few other exceptional fighters and hunt down the weaker competitors Thats been our strategy hasnt it To train like Careers counters Haymitch And who makes up the Career pack is generally agreed upon before the Games begin Peeta barely got in with them last year I think of the loathing I felt when I discovered Peeta was with the Careers during the last Games So were to try to get in with Finnick and Brutus  is that what youresaying Not necessarily Everyones a victor Make your own pack if youd rather Choose who you like Id suggest Chaff and Seeder Although Finnicks not to be ignored says Haymitch Find someone to team up with who might be of some use to you Remember youre not in a ring full of trembling children anymore These people are all experienced killers no matter what shape they appear to be in Maybe hes right Only who could I trust Seeder maybe But do I really want to make a pact with her only to possibly have to kill her later No Still I made a pact with Rue under the same circumstances I tell Haymitch Ill try even though I think Ill be pretty bad at the whole thing Effie shows up a bit early to take us down because last year even though we were on time we were the last two tributes to show up But Haymitch tells her he doesnt want her taking us down to the gym None of the other victors will be showing up with ababysitter and being the youngest its even more important we look selfreliant So she has to satisfy herself with taking us to the elevator fussing over our hair and pushing the button for us Its such a short ride that theres no real time for conversation but when Peeta takes my hand I dont pull it away I may have ignored him last night in private but in training we must appear as an inseparable team Effie neednt have worried about us being the last to arrive Only Brutus and the woman from District  Enobaria are present Enobaria looks to be about thirty and all I can remember about her is that in handtohand combat she killed one tribute by ripping open his throat with her teeth She became so famous for this act that after she was a victor she had her teeth cosmetically altered so each one ends in a sharp point like a fang and is inlaid with gold She has no shortage of admirers in the Capitol By ten oclockonly about half of the tributes have shown up Atala the woman who runs training begins her spiel right on time unfazed by the poor attendance Maybe she expected it Im sort of relieved because that means there are a dozen people I dont have to pretend to make friends with Atala runs through the list of stations which include both combat andsurvival skills and releases us to train I tell Peeta I think wed do best to split up thus covering more territory When he goes off to chuck spears with Brutus and Chaff I head over to the knottying station hardly anyone ever bothers to visit it I like the trainer and he remembers me fondly maybe because I spent time with him last year Hes pleased when I show him I can still set the trap that leaves an enemy dangling by a leg from a tree Clearly he took note ofmy snares in the arena last year and now sees me as an advanced pupil so I ask him to review every kind of knot that might come in handy and a few that Ill probably never use Id be content to spend the morning alone with him but after about an hour and a half someone puts his arms around me from behind his fingers easily finishing the complicated knot Ive been sweating over Of course its Finnick who seems to have spent his childhood doing nothing but wielding tridents and manipulating ropes into fancy knots for nets I guess I watch for a minute while he picks up a length of rope makes a noose and then pretends to hang himself for my amusement Rolling my eyes I head over to another vacant station where tributes can learn to build fires I already make excellent fires but Im still pretty dependent on matchesfor starting them So the trainer has me work with flint steel and some charred cloth This is much harder than it looks and even working as intently as I can it takes me about an hour to get a fire going I look up with a triumphant smile only to find I have company The two tributes from District  are beside me struggling to start a decent fire with matches I think about leaving but I really want to try using the flint again and if I have to report back to Haymitch that I tried to make friends these two might be a bearable choice Both are small in stature with ashen skin and black hair The woman Wiress is probably around my mothers age and speaks in a quiet intelligent voice But right away I notice she has a habit of dropping off her words in mid sentence as if shes forgotten youre there Beetee the man is older and somewhat fidgety He wears glasses but spends a lot of time looking under them Theyre a little strange but Im prettysure neither of them is going to try to make me uncomfortable by stripping naked And theyre from District  Maybe they can even confirm my suspicions of an uprising there I glance around the Training Center Peeta is at the center of a ribald circle of knife throwers The morphlings from District  are in the camouflage station painting each others faces with bright pink swirls The male tribute from District  is vomiting wine on the swordfighting floor Finnick and the old woman from his district are using the archery station Johanna Mason is naked again and oiling her skin down for a wrestling lesson I decide to stay put Wiress and Beetee make decent company They seem friendly enough but dont pry We talk about our talents they tell me they both invent things which makes my supposed interest in fashion seem pretty weak Wiress brings up some sort of stitching device shes working on It sensesthe density of the fabric and selects the strength she says and then becomes absorbed in a bit of dry straw before she can go on The strength of the thread Beetee finishes explaining Automatically It rules out human error Then he talks about his recent success creating a musical chip thats tiny enough to be concealed in a flake of glitter but can hold hours of songs I remember Octavia talking about this during the wedding shoot and I see a possible chance to allude to the uprising Oh yeah My prep team was all upset a few months ago I think because they couldnt get hold of that I say casually I guess a lot of orders from District Three were getting backed up Beetee examines me under his glasses Yes Did you have any similar backups in coal production this year he asks No Well we lost a couple of weeks when they brought in a new Head Peacekeeper and his crew but nothing major I say To production I mean Twoweeks sitting around your house doing nothing just means two weeks of being hungry for most people I thinkthey understand what Im trying to say That weve had no uprising Oh Thats a shame says Wiress in a slightly disappointed voice I found your district very  She trails off distracted by something in her head Interesting fills in Beetee We both did I feel bad knowing that their district must have suffered much worse than ours I feel I have to defend my people Well there arent very many of us in Twelve I say Not that youd know it nowadays by the size of the Peacekeeping force But I guess were interesting enough As we move over to the shelter station Wiress stops and gazes up at the stands where the Gamemakers are roaming around eating and drinking sometimes taking notice of us Look she says giving her head a slight nod intheir direction I look up and see Plutarch Heavensbee in the magnificent purple robe with the furtrimmed collar that designates him as Head Gamemaker Hes eating a turkey leg I dont see why this merits comment but I say Yes hes been promoted to Head Gamemaker this year No no There by the corner of the table You can just  says Wiress Beetee squints under his glasses Just make it out I stare in that direction perplexed But then I see it A patch of space about six inches square at the corner of the table seems almost to be vibrating Its as if the air is rippling in tiny visible waves distorting the sharp edges of the wood and a goblet of wine someone has set there A force field Theyve set one up between the Gamemakers and us I wonder what brought that on Beetee says Me probably I confess Last year I shot an arrow at them during my private training session Beetee and Wiress look at mecuriously I was provoked So do all force fields have a spot like that Chink says Wiress vaguely In the armor as it were finishes Beetee Ideally itd be invisible wouldnt it I want to ask them more but lunch is announced I look for Peeta but hes hanging with a group of about ten other victors so I decide just to eat with District  Maybe I can get Seeder to join us When we make our way into the dining area I see some of Peetas gang have other ideas Theyre dragging all the smaller tables to form one large table so that we all have to eat together Now I dont know what to do Even at school I used to avoid eating at a crowded table Frankly Id probably have sat alone if Madge hadnt made a habit of joining me I guess Id have eaten with Gale except being two grades apart our lunch never fell at the same time I take a tray and start making my way around the foodladen carts that ring the room Peeta catches up withme at the stew Hows it going Good Fine I like the District Three victors I say Wiress and Beetee Really he asks Theyre something of a joke to the others Why does that not surprise me I say I think of how Peeta was always surrounded at schoolby a crowd of friends Its amazing really that he ever took any notice of me except to think I was odd Johannas nicknamed them Nuts and Volts he says I think shes Nuts and hes Volts And so Im stupid for thinking they might be useful Because of something Johanna Mason said while she was oiling up her breasts for wrestling I retort Actually I think the nicknames been around for years And I didnt mean that as an insult Im just sharing information he says Well Wiress and Beetee are smart They invent things They could tell by sight that a force field had been put up betweenus and the Gamemakers And if we have to have allies I want them I toss the ladle back in a pot of stew splattering us both with the gravy What are you so angry about Peeta asks wiping the gravy from his shirtfront Because I teased you on the elevator Im sorry I thought you would just laugh about it Forget it I say with a shake of my head Its a lot of things Darius he says Darius The Games Haymitch making us team up with the others I say It can just be you and me you know he says I know But maybe Haymitch is right I say Dont tell him I said so but he usually is where the Games are concerned Well you can have final say about our allies But right now Im leaning toward Chaff and Seeder says Peeta Im okay with Seeder not Chaff I say Not yet anyway Come on and eat with him I promise I wont let him kiss you again says Peeta Chaff doesnt seem as bad at lunch Hes sober andwhile he talks too loud and makes bad jokes a lot most of them are at his own expense I can see why he would be good for Haymitch whose thoughts run so darkly But Im still not sure Im ready to team up with him I try hard to be more sociable not just with Chaff but with the group at large After lunch I do the edibleinsect station with the District  tributes  Cecelia whos got three kids at home and Woof a really old guy whos hard of hearing and doesnt seem to know whats going on since he keeps trying to stuff poisonous bugs in his mouth I wish I could mention meeting Twill and Bonnie in the woods but I cant figure out how Cashmere and Gloss the sister and brother from District  invite me over and we make hammocks for a while Theyre polite but cool and I spend the whole time thinking about how I killed both the tributes from their district Glimmer and Marvel last year and that they probably knew them and might evenhave been their mentors Both my hammock and my attempt to connect with them are mediocre at best I join Enobaria at sword training and exchange a few comments but its clear neither of us wants to team up Finnick appears again when Im picking up fishing tips but mostly just to introduce me to Mags the elderly woman whos also from District  Between her district accent and her garbled speech  possibly shes had astroke  I cant make out more than one in four words But I swear she can make a decent fishhook out of anythinga thorn a wishbone an earring After a while I tune out the trainer and simply try to copy whatever Mags does When I make a pretty good hook out of a bent nail and fasten it to some strands of my hair she gives me a toothless smile and an unintelligible comment I think might be praiseSuddenly I remember how she volunteered to replace the young hysterical woman in her district It couldnt be because she thought she had any chance of winning She did it to save the girl just like I volunteered last year to save Prim And I decide I want her on my team Great Now I have to go back and tell Haymitch I want an eightyyearold and Nuts and Volts for my allies Hell love that So I give up trying to make friends and go over to the archery range for some sanity Its wonderful there getting to try out all the different bows and arrows The trainer Tax seeing that the standing targets offer no challenge for me begins to launch these silly fake birds high into the air for me to hit At first it seems stupid but it turns out to be kind of fun Much more like hunting a moving creature Since Im hitting everything he throws up he starts increasing the number of birds he sends airborne I forget the rest of the gym and the victorsand how miserable I am and lose myself in the shooting When I manage to take down five birds in one round I realize its so quiet I can hear each one hit the floor I turn and see the majority of the victors have stopped to watch me Their faces show everything from envy to hatred to admiration After training Peeta and I hang out waiting for Haymitch and Effie to show up for dinner When were called to eat Haymitch pounces on me immediately So at least half the victors have instructed their mentors to request you as an ally I know it cant be your sunny personality They saw her shoot says Peeta with a smile Actually I saw her shoot for real for the first time Im about to put in a formal request myself Youre that good Haymitch asks me So good that Brutus wants you I shrug But I dont want Brutus I want Mags and District Three Of course you do Haymitch sighs and orders a bottle of wineIll tell everybody youre still making up your mind After my shooting exhibition I still get teased some but I no longer feel like Im being mocked In fact I feel as if Ive somehow been initiated into the victors circle During the next two days I spend time with almost everybody headed for the arena Even the morphlings who with Peetas help paint me into a field of yellow flowers Even Finnick who gives me an hour of trident lessons in exchange for an hour of archery instruction And the more I come to know these people the worse it is Because on the whole I dont hate them And some I like And a lot of them are so damaged that mynatural instinct would be to protect them But all of them must die if Im to save Peeta The final day of training ends with our private sessions We each get fifteen minutesbefore the Gamemakers to amaze them with our skills but I dont know what any of us might have to show them Theres a lot of kidding about it at lunch What we might do Sing dance strip tell jokes Mags who I can understand a little better now decides shes just going to take a nap I dont know what Im going to do Shoot some arrows I guess Haymitch said to surprise them if we could but Im fresh out of ideas As the girl from  Im scheduled to go last The dining room gets quieter and quieter as the tributes file out to go perform Its easier to keep up the irreverentinvincible manner weve all adopted when there are more of us As people disappear through the door all I can think is that they have a matter of days to live Peeta and I are finally left alone He reaches across the table to take my hands Decided what to do for the Gamemakers yet I shakemy head I cant really use them for target practice this year with the force field up and all Maybe make some fishhooks What about you Not a clue I keep wishing I could bake a cake or something he says Do some more camouflage I suggest If the morphlings have left me anything to work with he says wryly Theyve been glued to that station since training started We sit in silence awhile and then I blurt out the thing thats on both our minds How are we going to kill these people Peeta I dont know He leans his forehead down on our entwined hands I dont want them as allies Why did Haymitch want us to get to know them I say Itll make it so much harder than last time Except for Rue maybe But I guess I never really couldve killed her anyway She was just too much like Prim Peeta looks up at me his brow creased in thought Her death was the most despicable wasnt it None of themwere very pretty I say thinking of Glimmers and Catos ends They call Peeta so I wait by myself Fifteen minutes pass Then half an hour Its close to forty minutes before Im called When I go in I smell the sharp odor of cleaner and notice that one of the mats has been dragged to the center of the room The mood is very different from last years when the Gamemakers were half drunk and distractedly picking at tidbits from the banquet table They whisper among themselves looking somewhat annoyed What did Peeta do Something to upset them I feel a pang of worry That isnt good I dont want Peeta singling himself out as a target for the Gamemakers anger Thats part of my job To draw fire away from Peeta But how did he upset them Because Id love to do just that and more To break through the smug veneer of those who use their brains to find amusing ways to kill us To make them realize that whilewere vulnerable to the Capitols cruelties they are as well Do you have any idea how much I hate you I think You who have given your talents to the Games I try to catch Plutarch Heavensbees eye but he seems to be intentionally ignoring me as he has the entire training period I remember how he sought me out for a dance how pleased he was to show me the mockingjay on his watch His friendly manner has no place here How could it when Im a mere tribute and hes the Head Gamemaker So powerful so removed so safe  Suddenly I know just what Im going to do Something that will blow anything Peeta did right out of the water I go over to the knottying station and get a length of rope I start to manipulate it but its hard because Ive never made this actual knotmyself Ive only watched Finnicks clever fingers andthey moved so fast After about ten minutes Ive come up with a respectable noose I drag one of the target dummies out into the middle of the room and using some chinning bars hang it so it dangles by the neck Tying its hands behind its back would be a nice touch but I think I might be running out of time I hurry over to the camouflage station where some of the other tributes undoubtedly the morphlings have made a colossal mess But I find a partial container of bloodred berry juice that will serve my needs The fleshcolored fabric of the dummys skin makes a good absorbent canvas I carefully finger paint the words on its body concealing them from view Then I step away quickly to watch the reaction on the Gamemakers faces as they read the name on the dummy SENECA CRANE The effect on the Gamemakers is immediate and satisfying Several let out small shrieks Others lose their grips on their wineglasseswhich shatter musically against the ground Two seem to be considering fainting The look of shock is unanimous Now I have Plutarch Heavensbees attention He stares steadily at me as the juice from the peach he crushed in his hand runs through his fingers Finally he clears his throat and says You may go now Miss Everdeen I give a respectful nod and turn to go but at the last moment I cant resist tossing the container of berry juice over my shoulder I can hear the contents splatter against the dummy while a couple more wineglasses break As the elevator doors close before me I see no one has moved That surprised them I think It was rash and dangerous and no doubt I will pay for it ten times over But for the moment I feel something close to elation and I let myself savor it I want to find Haymitch immediately and tell him about my session but no ones around I guess theyre getting ready for dinner and I decideto go take a shower myself since my hands are stained from the juice As I stand in the water I begin to wonder about the wisdom of my latest trick The question that should now always be my guide is Will this help Peeta stay alive Indirectly this might not What happens in training is highly secretive so theres no point in taking action against me when no one will know what my transgression was In fact last year I was rewarded for my brashness This is a different sort of crime though If the Gamemakers are angry with me and decide to punish me in the arena Peeta could get caught up in the attack as well Maybe it was too impulsive Still  I cant say Im sorry I did it As we all gather for dinner I notice Peetas hands are faintly stained with a variety of colors even though his hair is still damp from bathing He must have done some form of camouflage after all Once the soup is served Haymitch gets right to theissue on everyones mind All right so how did your private sessions go I exchange a lookwith Peeta Somehow Im not that eager to put what I did into words In the calm of the dining room it seems very extreme You first I say to him It must have been really special I had to wait for forty minutes to go in Peeta seems to be struck with the same reluctance Im experiencing Well I  I did the camouflage thing like you suggested Katniss He hesitates Not exactly camouflage I mean I used the dyes To do what asks Portia I think of how ruffled the Gamemakers were when I entered the gym for my session The smell of cleaners The mat pulled over that spot in the center of the gym Was it to conceal something they were unable to wash away You painted something didnt you A picture Did you see it Peeta asks No But theydmade a real point of covering it up I say Well that would be standard They cant let one tribute know what another did says Effie unconcerned What did you paint Peeta She looks a little misty Was it a picture of Katniss Why would he paint a picture of me Effie I ask somehow annoyed To show hes going to do everything he can to defend you Thats what everyone in the Capitols expecting anyway Didnt he volunteer to go in with you Effie says as if its the most obvious thing in the world Actually I painted a picture of Rue Peeta says How she looked after Katniss had covered her in flowers Theres a long pause at the table while everyone absorbs this And what exactly were you trying to accomplish Haymitch asks in a very measured voice Im not sure I just wanted to hold them accountable if only for a moment says Peeta For killing that little girl This is dreadful Effie sounds like shes aboutto cry That sort of thinking  its forbidden Peeta Absolutely Youll only bring down more trouble on yourself and Katniss I have to agree with Effie on this one says Haymitch Portia and Cinna remain silent but their faces are very serious Of course theyre right But even though it worries me I think what he did was amazing I guess this is a bad time to mention I hung a dummy and painted Seneca Cranes name on it I say This has the desired effect After a moment of disbelief all the disapproval in the room hits me like a ton of bricks You  hung  Seneca Crane says Cinna Yes I was showing off my new knottying skills and he somehow ended up at the end of the noose I say Oh Katniss says Effie in a hushed voice How do you even know about that Is it a secret President Snow didnt act like it was In fact he seemed eager for me to know I say Effie leaves the table with her napkin pressed to her faceNow Ive upset Effie I should have lied and said I shot some arrows Youd have thought we planned it says Peeta giving me just the hint of a smile Didnt you asks Portia Her fingers press her eyelids closed as if shes warding off a verybright light No I say looking at Peeta with a new sense of appreciation Neither of us even knew what we were going to do before we went in And Haymitch says Peeta We decided we dont want any other allies in the arena Good Then I wont be responsible for you killing off any of my friends with your stupidity he says Thats just what we were thinking I tell him We finish the meal in silence but when we rise to go into the sitting room Cinna puts his arm around me and gives me a squeeze Come on and lets go get those training scores We gather around the television setand a redeyed Effie rejoins us The tributes faces come up district by district and their scores flash under their pictures One through twelve Predictably high scores for Cashmere Gloss Brutus Enobaria and Finnick Low to medium for the rest Have they ever given a zero I ask No but theres a first time for everything Cinna answers And it turns out hes right Because when Peeta and I each pull a twelve we make Hunger Games history No one feels like celebrating though Why did they do that I ask So that the others will have no choice but to target you says Haymitch flatly Go to bed I cant stand to look at either one of you Peeta walks me down to my room in silence but before he can say good night I wrap my arms around him and rest my head against his chest His hands slide up my back and his cheek leans against my hair Im sorry if I made things worse I say No worse than I did Why did you do itanyway he says I dont know To show them that Im more than just a piece in their Games I say He laughs a little no doubt remembering the night before the Games last year We were on the roof neither of us able to sleep Peeta had said something of the sort then but I hadnt understood what he meant Now I do Me too he tells me And Im not saying Im not going to try To get you home I mean But if Im perfectly honest about it  If youre perfectly honest about it you think President Snow has probably given them direct orders to make sure we die in the arena anyway I say Its crossed my mind says Peeta Its crossed my mind too Repeatedly But while I know Ill never leave that arena alive Im still holding on to the hope that Peeta will After all he didnt pull out those berries I did No one has ever doubted that Peetas defiance was motivated by love So maybe President Snow will prefer keeping him alive crushedand heartbroken as a living warning to others But even if that happens everyone will know weve gone out fighting right Peeta asks Everyone will I reply And for the first time I distance myself from the personal tragedy that has consumed me since they announced the Quell I remember theold man they shot in District  and Bonnie and Twill and the rumored uprisings Yes everyone in the districts will be watching me to see how I handle this death sentence this final act of President Snows dominance They will be looking for some sign that their battles have not been in vain If I can make it clear that Im still defying the Capitol right up to the end the Capitol will have killed me  but not my spirit What better way to give hope to the rebels The beauty of this idea is that my decision to keep Peeta alive atthe expense of my own life is itself an act of defiance A refusal to play the Hunger Games by the Capitols rules My private agenda dovetails completely with my public one And if I really could save Peeta  in terms of a revolution this would be ideal Because I will be more valuable dead They can turn me into some kind of martyr for the cause and paint my face on banners and it will do more to rally people than anything I could do if I was living But Peeta would be more valuable alive and tragic because he will be able to turn his pain into words that will transform people Peeta would lose it if he knew I was thinking any of this so I only say So what should we do with our last few days I just want to spend every possible minute of the rest of my life with you Peeta replies Come on then I say pulling him into my room It feels like such a luxury sleeping with Peeta again I didnt realize until now how starved Ive been forhuman closeness For the feel of him beside me in the darkness I wish I hadnt wasted the last couple of nights shutting him out I sink down into sleep enveloped in his warmth and when I open my eyes again daylights streaming through the windows No nightmares he says No nightmares I confirm You None Id forgotten what a real nights sleep feels like he says We lie there for a while in no rush to begin the day Tomorrow night will be the televised interview so today Effie and Haymitch should be coaching us More high heels and sarcastic comments I think But then the redheaded Avox girl comes in with a note from Effie saying that given our recent tour both she and Haymitch have agreed we can handle ourselves adequately in public The coaching sessions have been canceled Really says Peeta taking the note from my hand and examining it Do you know what this means Well have thewhole day to ourselves Its too bad we cant go somewhere I say wistfully Who says we cant he asks The roof We order a bunch of food grab some blankets and head up to the roof for a picnic A daylong picnic in the flower garden that tinkles with wind chimes We eat We lie in the sun I snap off hanging vines and use my newfound knowledge from training to practice knots and weave nets Peeta sketches me We make up a game with the force field that surrounds the roofone of us throws an apple into it and theother person has to catch it No one bothers us By late afternoon I lie with my head on Peetas lap making a crown of flowers while he fiddles with my hair claiming hes practicing his knots After a while his hands go still What I ask I wish I could freeze this moment right here rightnow and live in it forever he says Usually this sort of comment the kind that hints of his undying love for me makes me feel guilty and awful But I feel so warm and relaxed and beyond worrying about a future Ill never have I just let the word slip out Okay I can hear the smile in his voice Then youll allow it Ill allow it I say His fingers go back to my hair and I doze off but he rouses me to see the sunset Its a spectacular yellow and orange blaze behind the skyline of the Capitol I didnt think youd want to miss it he says Thanks I say Because I can count on my fingers the number of sunsets I have left and I dont want to miss any of them We dont go and join the others for dinner and no one summons us Im glad Im tired of making everyone around me so miserable says Peeta Everybody crying Or Haymitch  He doesnt need to go on We stay on the roof until bedtime and then quietly slip down to my roomwithout encountering anyone The next morning were roused by my prep team The sight of Peeta and me sleeping together is too much for Octavia because she bursts into tears right away You remember what Cinna told us Venia says fiercely Octavia nods and goes out sobbing Peeta has to return to his room for prep and Im left alone with Venia and Flavius The usual chatter has been suspended In fact theres little talk at all other than to have me raise my chin or comment on a makeup technique Its nearly lunch when I feel something dripping on my shoulder and turn to find Flavius whos snipping away at my hair with silent tears running down his face Venia gives him a look and he gently sets the scissors on the table and leaves Then its just Venia whose skin is so pale her tattoos appear to be leaping off it Almost rigid with determination she does my hair and nails and makeup fingers flying swiftly to compensate for herabsent teammates The whole time she avoids my gaze Its only when Cinna shows up to approve me and dismiss her that she takes my hands looks me straight in the eye and says We would all like you to know what a  privilege it has been to make you look your best Then she hastens from the room My prep team My foolish shallow affectionate pets with their obsessions with feathers and parties nearly break my heart with their goodbye Its certain from Venias last words that we all know I wont be returning Does the whole world know it I wonder I look at Cinna He knows certainly But as he promised theres no danger of tears from him So what am I wearing tonight I ask eyeing the garment bag that holdsmy dress President Snow put in the dress order himself says Cinna He unzips the bag revealing one of thewedding dresses I wore for the photo shoot Heavy white silk with a low neckline and tight waist and sleeves that fall from my wrists to the floor And pearls Everywhere pearls Stitched into the dress and in ropes at my throat and forming the crown for the veil Even though they announced the Quarter Quell the night of the photo shoot people Still voted for their favorite dress and this was the winner The president says youre to wear it tonight Our objections were ignored I rub a bit of the silk between my fingers trying to figure out President Snows reasoning I suppose since I was the greatest offender my pain and loss and humiliation should be in the brightest spotlight This he thinks will make that clear Its so barbaric the president turning my bridal gown into my shroud that the blow strikes home leaving me with a dull ache inside Well itd be a shame to waste such a pretty dress is all I say Cinna helpsme carefully into the gown As it settles on my shoulders they cant help giving a shrug of complaint Was it always this heavy I ask I remember several of the dresses being dense but this one feels like it weighs a ton I had to make some slight alterations because of the lighting says Cinna I nod but I cant see what that has to do with anything He decks me out in the shoes and the pearl jewelry and the veil Touches up my makeup Has me walk Youre ravishing he says Now Katniss because this bodice is so fitted I dont want you raising your arms above your head Well not until you twirl anyway Will I be twirling again I ask thinking of my dress last year Im sure Caesar will ask you And if he doesnt you suggest it yourself Only not right away Save it for your big finale Cinna instructs me You give me a signal so I know when I say All right Any plans for your interview I know Haymitch left you two to yourown devices he says No this year Im just winging it The funny thing is Im not nervous at all And Im not However much President Snow may hate me this Capitol audience is mine We meet up with Effie Haymitch Portia and Peeta at the elevator Peetas in an elegant tuxedo and white gloves The sort of thing grooms wear to get married in here in the Capitol Back home everything is so much simpler A woman usually rents a white dress thats been worn hundreds of times The man wears something clean thats not mining clothes They fill out some forms at the Justice Building and are assigned a house Family and friends gather for a meal or bit of cake if it can be afforded Even if it cant theres always a traditional song we sing as the new couple crosses the threshold of their home And we have our own little ceremony where they make their first fire toast a bit of bread and share it Maybe itsoldfashioned but no one really feels married in District  until after the toasting The other tributes have already gathered offstage and are talking softly but when Peeta and I arrive they fall silent I realize everyones staring daggers at my wedding dress Are they jealous of its beauty The power it might have to manipulate the crowd Finally Finnick says I cant believe Cinna put you in that thing He didnt have any choice President Snow made him I say somewhat defensively I wont let anyone criticize Cinna Cashmere tosses her flowing blond curls back and spits out Well you look ridiculous She grabs her brothers hand and pulls him into place to lead our procession onto the stage The other tributes begin to line up as well Im confused because while they all are angry some are giving us sympathetic pats on the shoulder and Johanna Mason actually stops to straighten my pearl necklace Makehim pay for it okay she says I nod but I dont know what she means Not until were all sitting out onstage and Caesar Flickerman hair and face highlighted in lavender this year has done his opening spiel and the tributes begin their interviews This is the first time I realize the depth of betrayal felt among the victors and the rage that accompanies it But they are so smart so wonderfully smart about how they play it because it all comes back to reflect on the government and President Snow in particular Not everyone There are the old throwbacks like Brutus and Enobaria who are just here for another Games and those too baffled or drugged or lost to join in on the attack But there are enough victors who still have the wits and the nerve to come out fighting Cashmere starts the ball rolling with a speech about how she just cant stop crying when she thinks of how much the people in the Capitol must besuffering because they will lose us Gloss recalls the kindness shown here to him and his sister Beetee questions the legality of the Quell in his nervous twitchy way wondering if its been fully examined by experts of late Finnick recites a poem he wrote to his one true love in the Capitol and about a hundred people faint because theyre sure he means them By the time Johanna Mason gets up shes asking if something cant be done about the situation Surely the creators of the Quarter Quell never anticipated such love forming between the victors and the Capitol No one could be so cruel as to sever such a deep bond Seeder quietly ruminates about how back in District  everyone assumes President Snow is allpowerful So if hes allpowerful why doesnt he change the Quell And Chaff who comes right on her heels insists the president could change the Quell if he wanted to but he must not think itmatters much to anyone By the time Im introduced the audience is an absolute wreck People have been weeping and collapsing and even calling for change The sight of me in mywhite silk bridal gown practically causes a riot No more me no more starcrossed lovers living happily ever after no more wedding I can see even Caesars professionalism showing some cracks as he tries to quiet them so I can speak but my three minutes are ticking quickly away Finally theres a lull and he gets out So Katniss obviously this is a very emotional night for everyone Is there anything youd like to say My voice trembles as I speak Only that Im so sorry you wont get to be at my wedding  but Im glad you at least get to see me in my dress Isnt it just  the most beautiful thing I donthave to look at Cinna for a signal I know this is the right time I begin to twirl slowly raising the sleeves of my heavy gown above my head When I hear the screams of the crowd I think its because I must look stunning Then I notice something is rising up around me Smoke From fire Not the flickerystuff I wore last year in the chariot but something much more real that devours my dress I begin to panic as the smoke thickens Charred bits of black silk swirl into the air and pearls clatter to the stage Somehow Im afraid to stop because my flesh doesnt seem to be burning and I know Cinna must be behind whatever is happening So I keep spinning and spinning For a split second Im gasping completely engulfed in the strange flames Then all at once the fire is gone I slowly come to a stop wondering if Imnaked and why Cinna has arranged to burn away my wedding dress But Im not naked Im in a dress of the exact design of my wedding dress only its the color of coal and made of tiny feathers Wonderingly I lift my long flowing sleeves into the air and thats when I see myself on the television screen Clothed in black except for the white patches on my sleeves Or should I say my wings Because Cinna has turned me into a mockingjay Im still smoldering a little so its with a tentative hand that Caesar reaches out to touch my headpiece The white has burned away leaving a smooth fitted veil of black that drapes into the neckline of the dress in the back Feathers says Caesar Youre like a bird A mockingjay I think I say giving my wings a small flap Its the bird on the pin I wear as a token A shadow of recognition flickers across Caesars face and I can tell he knows that the mockingjay isnt just my token That its cometo symbolize so much more That what will be seen as a flashy costume change in the Capitol is resonating in an entirely different way throughout the districts But he makes the best of it Well hats off to your stylist I dont think anyone can argue that thats not the most spectacular thing weve ever seen in an interview Cinna I think you better take a bow Caesar gestures for Cinna to rise He does and makes a small gracious bow And suddenly I am so afraid for him What has he done Something terribly dangerous An act of rebellion in itself And hes done it for me I remember his words  Dont worry I always channel my emotions into my work That way I dont hurt anyone but myself  and Im afraid he has hurt himself beyond repair The significance of my fiery transformation will not be lost on President Snow The audience whos been stunned into silence breaks into wild applause I can barely hear thebuzzer that indicates that my three minutes are up Caesar thanks me and I go back to my seat my dress now feeling lighter than air As I pass Peeta whos headed for his interview he doesnt meet my eyes I take my seat carefully but aside from the puffs of smoke here and there I seem unharmed so I turn my attention to him Caesar and Peeta have been a natural team since they first appeared together a year ago Their easy giveandtake comic timing and ability to segue into heart wrenching moments like Peetas confession oflove for me have made them a huge success with the audience They effortlessly open with a few jokes about fires and feathers and overcooking poultry But anyone can see that Peeta is preoccupied so Caesar directs the conversation right into the subject thats on everyones minds So Peetawhat was it like when after all youve been through you found out about the Quell asks Caesar I was in shock I mean one minute Im seeing Katniss looking so beautiful in all these wedding gowns and the next  Peeta trails off You realized there was never going to be a wedding asks Caesar gently Peeta pauses for a long moment as if deciding something He looks out at the spellbound audience then at tin floor then finally up at Caesar Caesar do you think all our friends here can keep a secret An uncomfortable laugh emanates from the audience What can he mean Keep a secret from who Our whole world is watching I feel quite certain of it says Caesar Were already married says Peeta quietly The crowd reacts in astonishment and I have to bury my face in the folds of my skirt so they cant see my confusion Where on earth is he going with this But  how can that be asks Caesar Oh its not an official marriage Wedidnt go to the Justice Building or anything But we have this marriage ritual in District Twelve I dont know what its like in the other districts But theres this thing we do says Peeta and he briefly describes the toasting Were your families there asks Caesar No we didnt tell anyone Not even Haymitch And Katnisss mother would never have approved But you see we knew if we were married in the Capitol there wouldnt be a toasting And neither of us really wanted to wait any longer So one day we just did it Peeta says And to us were more married than any piece of paper or big party could make us So this was before the Quell says Caesar Of course before the Quell Im sure wed never have done it after we knew says Peeta starting to get upset But who couldve seen it coming No one We went through the Games we were victors everyone seemed so thrilled to see us together and then out of nowhereI mean how couldwe anticipate a thing like that You couldnt Peeta Caesar puts an arm around his shoulders As you say no one couldve But I have to confess Im glad you two had at least a few months of happiness together Enormous applause As if encouraged I look up from my feathers and let the audience see my tragic smile of thanks The residual smoke from the feathers has made my eyes teary which adds a very nice touch Im not glad says Peeta I wish we had waited until the whole thing was done officially This takes even Caesar aback Surely even a brief time is better than no time Maybe Id think that too Caesar says Peeta bitterly if it werent for the baby There Hes done it againDropped a bomb that wipes out the efforts of every tribute who came before him Well maybe not Maybe this year he has only lit the fuse on a bomb that the victorsthemselves have been building Hoping someone would be able to detonate it Perhaps thinking it would be me in my bridal gown Not knowing how much I rely on Cinnas talents whereas Peeta needs nothing more than his wits As the bomb explodes it sends accusations of injustice and barbarism and cruelty flying out in every direction Even the most Capitolloving Gameshungry bloodthirsty person out there cant ignore at least for a moment how horrific the whole thing is I am pregnant The audience cant absorb the news right away It has to strike them and sink in and be confirmed by other voices before they begin to sound like a herd of wounded animals moaning shrieking calling for help And me I know my face is projected in a tight closeup on the screen but I dont make any effort to hide it Because for a moment even I am working through what Peeta has said Isnt it the thing I dreaded most about the weddingabout the futurethe loss of my children to the Games And it could be true now couldnt it If I hadnt spent my life building up layers of defenses until I recoil at even the suggestion of marriage or a family Caesar cant rein in the crowd again not even when the buzzer sounds Peeta nods his goodbye and comes back to his seat without any more conversation I can see Caesars lips moving but the place is in total chaos and I cant hear a word Only the blast of the anthem cranked up so loud I can feel it vibrating through my bones lets us know where we stand in the program I automatically rise and as I do I sense Peeta reaching out for me Tears run down his face as I take his hand How real are the tears Is this an acknowledgment that he has been stalked by the same fears that I have That every victor has Every parent in every district in Panem I look back to the crowd but the faces of Rues mother and father swim beforemy eyes Their sorrow Their loss I turn spontaneously to Chaff and offer my hand I feel my fingers close around the stump that now completes his arm and hold fast And then it happens Up and down the row the victors begin to join hands Some right away like the morphlings or Wiress and Beetee Others unsure but caught up in the demands of those around them like Brutus and Enobaria By the time the anthem plays its final strains all twentyfour of us stand in one unbroken line in what must be the first public show of unity among the districts since the Dark Days You can see the realization of this as the screens begin to pop into blackness Its too late though In the confusion they didnt cut us off in time Everyone has seen Theres disorder on the stage now too as the lights go out and were left to stumble back into the Training Center Ive lost hold of Chaff but Peeta guides meinto an elevator Finnick and Johanna try to join us but a harried Peacekeeper blocks their way and we shoot upward alone The moment we step off the elevator Peeta grips my shoulders There isnt much time so tell me Is there anything I have to apologize for Nothing I say It was a big leap to take without my okay but Im just as glad I didnt know didnt have time to secondguess him to let any guilt over Gale detract from how I really feel about what Peeta did Which is empowered Somewhere very far off is a place called District  where my mother and sister and friends will have to deal with the fallout from this night Just a brief hovercraft ride away is an arena where tomorrow Peeta and I and the other tributes will face our own form of punishment But even if all of us meet terrible ends something happened on that stage tonight that cant be undone We victors staged our own uprising and maybejust maybe the Capitol wont be able to contain this one We wait for the others to return but when the elevator opens only Haymitch appears Its madness out there Everyones been sent home and theyve canceled the recap of the interviews on television Peeta and I hurry to the window and try to make sense of the commotion far below us on the streets What are they saying Peeta asks Are they asking the president to stop the Games I dont think they know themselves what to ask The whole situation is unprecedented Even the idea of opposing the Capitols agenda is a source of confusion for the people here says Haymitch But theres no way Snow would cancel the Games You know that right I do Of course he could never back down now The only option left to him is to strike back and strike back hard The others went home I ask They were ordered to I dont know how much luck theyre havinggetting through the mob says Haymitch Then well never see Effie again says Peeta We didnt see her on the morning of the Games last year Youll give her our thanks More than that Really make it special Its Effie after all I say Tell her how appreciative we are and how she was the best escort ever and tell her  tell her we send our love For a while we just stand there in silence delaying the inevitable Then Haymitch says it I guess this is where we say our goodbyes as well Any last words of advice Peeta asks Stay alive Haymitch says gruffly Thats almost an old joke with us now He gives us each a quick embrace and I can tell its all he can stand Go to bed You need your rest I know I should say a whole bunch of things to Haymitch but I cant think of anything he doesnt already know really and my throat is so tight I doubt anything would come out anyway So once again I let Peeta speak for us both You take careHaymitch he says We cross the room but in the doorway Haymitchs voice stops us Katniss when yourein the arena he begins Then he pauses Hes scowling in a way that makes me sure Ive already disappointed him What I ask defensively You just remember who the enemy is Haymitch tells me Thats all Now go on Get out of hereWe walk down the hallway Peeta wants to stop by his room to shower off the makeup and meet me in a few minutes but I wont let him Im certain that if a door shuts between us it will lock and Ill have to spend the night without him Besides I have a shower in my room I refuse to let go of his hand Do we sleep I dont know We spend the night holding each other in some halfway land betweendreams and waking Not talking Both afraid to disturb the other in the hope that well be able to store up a few precious minutes of rest Cinna and Portia arrive with the dawn and I know Peeta will have to go Tributes enter the arena alone He gives me a light kiss See you soon he says See you soon I answer Cinna who will help dress me for the Games accompanies me to the roof Im about to mount the ladder to the hovercraft when I remember I didnt say good bye to Portia Ill tell her says Cinna The electric current freezes me in place on the ladder until the doctor injects the tracker into my left forearm Now they will always be able to locate me in the arena The hovercraft takes off and I look out the windows until they black out Cinna keeps pressing me to eat and when that fails to drink I manage to keep sipping water thinking of the days of dehydration that almost killed me last year Thinking of how I will need mystrength to keep Peeta alive When we reach the Launch Room at the arena I shower Cinna braids my hair down my back and helps me dress over simple undergarments This years tribute outfit is a fitted blue jumpsuit made of very sheer material that zippers up the front A sixinchwide padded belt covered in shiny purple plastic A pair of nylon shoes with rubber soles What do you think I ask holding the fabric out for Cinna to examine He frowns as he rubs the thin stuff between his fingers I dont know It will offer little in the way of protection from cold or water Sun I ask picturing a burning sun over a barren desert Possibly If its been treated he says Oh I almost forgot this He takes my gold mockingjay pin from his pocket and fixes it to the jumpsuit My dress was fantastic last night I say Fantastic and reckless But Cinna must know that I thought you might likeit he says with a tight smile We sit as we did last year holding hands until the voice tells me to prepare for the launch He walks me over to the circular metal plate and zips up the neck of my jumpsuit securely Remember girl on fire he says Im still betting on you He kisses my forehead and steps back as the glass cylinder slides down around me Thank you I say although he probably cant hear me I lift my chin holding my head high the way he always tells me to and wait for the plate to rise But it doesnt And it still doesnt I look at Cinna raising my eyebrows for an explanation He just gives his head a slight shake asperplexed as I am Why are they delaying this Suddenly the door behind him bursts open and three Peacekeepers spring into the room Two pin Cinnas arms behind him and cuff him while the third hits him in thetemple with such force hes knocked to his knees But they keep hitting him with metalstudded gloves opening gashes on his face and body Im screaming my head off banging on the unyielding glass trying to reach him The Peacekeepers ignore me completely as they drag Cinnas limp body from the room All thats left are the smears of blood on the floor Sickened and terrified I feel the plate begin to rise Im still leaning against the glass when the breeze catches my hair and I force myself to straighten up Just in time too because the glass is retreating and Im standing free in the arena Something seems to be wrong with my vision The ground is too bright and shiny and keeps undulating I squint down at my feet and see that my metal plate is surrounded by blue waves that lap up over my boots Slowly I raise my eyes and take in the water spreading out in every direction I can only form one clear thoughtThis is no place for a girl on fire PART III THE ENEMYLadies and gentlemen let the Seventyfifth Hunger Games begin The voice of Claudius Templesmith the Hunger Games announcer hammers my ears I have less than a minute to get my bearings Then the gong will sound and the tributes will be free to move off their metal plates But move where I cant think straight The image of Cinna beaten and bloody consumes me Where is he now What are they doing to him Torturing him Killing him Turning him into an Avox Obviously his assault was staged to unhinge me the same way Dariuss presence in my quarters was And it has unhinged me All I want to do is collapse on my metal plate But I can hardly do that after what I just witnessed I must be strong I owe it to Cinna who risked everything by undermining President Snow and turning mybridal silk into mockingjay plumage And I owe it to the rebels who emboldened by Cinnas example might be fighting to bring down the Capitol at this moment My refusal to play the Games on the Capitols terms is to be my last act of rebellion So I grit my teeth and will myself to be a player Where are you I can still make no sense of my surroundings Where are you I demand an answer from myself and slowly the world comes into focus Blue water Pink sky Whitehot sun beating down All right theres the Cornucopia the shining gold metal horn about forty yards away At first it appears to be sitting on a circular island But on closer examination I see the thin strips of land radiating from the circle like the spokes on a wheel I think there are ten to twelve and they seem equidistant from one another Betweenthe spokes all is water Water and a pair of tributes Thats it then There are twelve spokes each with two tributes balanced on metal plates between them The other tribute in my watery wedge is old Woof from District  Hes about as far to my right as the land strip on my left Beyond the water wherever you look a narrow beach and then dense greenery I scan the circle of tributes looking for Peeta but he must be blocked from my view by the Cornucopia I catch a handful of water as it washes in and smell it Then I touch the tip of my wet finger to my tongue As I suspected its saltwater Just like the waves Peeta and I encountered on our brief tour of the beach in District  But at least it seems clean There are no boats no ropes not even a bit of driftwood to cling to No theres only one way to get to the Cornucopia When the gong sounds I dont even hesitate before I dive to my left Its a longer distance thanIm used to and navigating the waves takes a little more skill than swimming across my quiet lake at home but my body seems oddly light and I cut through the water effortlessly Maybe its the salt I pull myself dripping onto the land strip and sprint down the sandy stretch for the Cornucopia I can see no one else converging from my side although the gold horn blocks a good portion of my view I dont let the thought of adversaries slow me down though Im thinking like a Career now and the first thing I want is to get my hands on a weapon Last year the supplies were spread out quite a distance around the Cornucopia with the most valuable closest to the horn But this year the booty seems to be piled at the twentyfoothigh mouth My eyes instantly home in on a golden bow just in arms reach and I yank it free Theres someone behind me Im alerted by I dont know a soft shift of sand or maybe just a change in theair currents I pull an arrow from the sheath thats still wedged in the pile and arm my bow as I turn Finnick glistening and gorgeous stands a few yards away with a trident poised to attack A net dangles from his other hand Hes smiling a little but the muscles in his upper body are rigid in anticipation You can swim too he says Where did you learn that in District Twelve We have a big bathtub I answer You must he says You like the arena Not particularly But you should They must have built it especially for you I say with an edge of bitterness It seems like it anyway with all the water when I bet only a handful of the victors can swim And there was no pool in the Training Center no chance to learn Either you came in here a swimmer or youd better be a really fast learner Even participation in the initial bloodbath depends on being able to cover twenty yards of water That gives District  anenormous advantage For a moment were frozen sizing each other up our weapons our skill Then Finnick suddenly grins Luckything were allies Right Sensing a trap Im about to let my arrow fly hoping it finds his heart before the trident impales me when he shifts his hand and something on his wrist catches the sunlight A solidgold bangle patterned with flames The same one I remember on Haymitchs wrist the morning I began training I briefly consider that Finnick could have stolen it to trick me but somehow I know this isnt the case Haymitch gave it to him As a signal to me An order really To trust Finnick I can hear other footsteps approaching I must decide at once Right I snap because even though Haymitch is my mentor and trying to keep me alive this angers me Why didnt he tell me hed made thisarrangement before Probably because Peeta and I had ruled out allies Now Haymitch has chosen one on his own Duck Finnick commands in such a powerful voice so different from his usual seductive purr that I do His trident goes whizzing over my head and theres a sickening sound of impact as it finds its target The man from District  the drunk who threw up on the swordfighting floor sinks to his knees as Finnick frees the trident from his chest Dont trust One and Two Finnick says Theres no time to question this I work the sheath of arrows free Each take one side I say He nods and I dart around the pile About four spokes apart Enobaria and Gloss are just reaching land Either theyre slow swimmers or they thought the water might be laced with other dangers which it might well be Sometimes its not good to consider too many scenarios But now that theyre on the sand theyll be here in a matter of secondsAnything useful I hear Finnick shout I quickly scan the pile on my side and find maces swords bows and arrows tridents knives spears axes metallic objects I have no name for  and nothing else Weapons I call back Nothing but weapons Same here he confirms Grab what you want and lets go I shoot an arrow at Enobaria whos gotten in too close for comfort but shes expecting it and dives back into the water before it can find its mark Gloss isnt quite as swift and I sink an arrow into his calf as he plunges into the waves I sling an extra bow and a second sheath of arrows over my body slide two long knives and an awl into my belt and meet up with Finnick at the front of the pile Do something about that would you he says I see Brutus barreling toward us His belt is undone and he has it stretched between his hands as a kind of shield I shoot at him and he manages to block the arrow with his belt before itcan skewer his liver Where it punctures the belt a purple liquid spews forth coating his face As I reload Brutus flattens on the ground rolls the few feet to the water and submerges Theres a clang of metal falling behind me Lets clear out I say to Finnick This last altercation has given Enobaria and Gloss time to reach theCornucopia Brutus is within shooting distance and somewhere certainly Cashmere is nearby too These four classic Careers will no doubt have a prior alliance If I had only my own safety to consider I might be willing to take them on with Finnick by my side But its Peeta Im thinking about I spot him now still stranded on his metal plate I take off and Finnick follows without question as if knowing this will be my next move When Im as close as I can get I start removing knives from my belt preparing to swim outto reach him and somehow bring him in Finnick drops a hand on my shoulder Ill get him Suspicion flickers up inside me Could this all just be a ruse For Finnick to win my trust and then swim out and drown Peeta I can I insist But Finnick has dropped all his weapons to the ground Better not exert yourself Not in your condition he says and reaches down and pats my abdomen Oh right Im supposed to be pregnant I think While Im trying to think what that means and how I should actmaybe throw up or somethingFinnick has positioned himself at the edge of the water Cover me he says He disappears with a flawless diveI raise my bow warding off any attackers from the Cornucopia but no one seems interested in pursuing us Sure enough Gloss Cashmere Enobaria and Brutus havegathered their pack formed already picking over the weapons A quick survey of the rest of the arena shows that most of the tributes are still trapped on their plates Wait no theres someone standing on the spoke to my left the one opposite Peeta Its Mags But she neither heads for the Cornucopia nor tries to flee Instead she splashes into the water and starts paddling toward me her gray head bobbing above the waves Well shes old but I guess after eighty years of living in District  she can keep afloat Finnick has reached Peeta now and is towing him back one arm across his chest while the other propels them through the water with easy strokes Peeta rides along without resisting I dont know what Finnick said or did that convinced him to put his life in his hands  showed him the bangle maybe Or just the sight of me waiting might have been enough When they reach the sand I help haul Peeta up onto dry land Helloagain he says and gives me a kiss Weve got allies Yes Just as Haymitch intended I answer Remind me did we make deals with anyone else Peeta asks Only Mags I think I say I nod toward the old woman doggedly making her way toward us Well I cant leave Mags behind says Finnick Shes one of the few people who actually likes me Ive got no problem with Mags I say Especially now that I see the arena Het fishhooks are probably our best chance of getting a meal Katniss wanted her on the first day says Peeta Katniss has remarkably good judgment says Finnick With one hand he reaches into the water and scoops out Mags like she weighs no more than a puppy She makes some remark that I think includes the word bob then pats her belt Look shes right Someone figured it out Finnick points to Beetee Hes flailing around in the waves but managing to keep his head above water What I say Thebelts Theyre flotation devices says Finnick I mean you have to propel yourself but theyll keep you from drowning I almost ask Finnick to wait to get Beetee and Wiress and take them with us but Beetees three spokes over and I cant even see Wiress For all I know Finnick would kill them as quickly as he did the tribute from  so instead I suggest we move on I hand Peeta a bow a sheath of arrows and a knife keeping the rest for myself But Mags tugs on my sleeve and babbles on until Ive given the awl to her Pleased she clamps the handle between her gums and reaches her arms up to Finnick He tosses his net over his shoulder hoists Mags on top of it grips his tridents in his free hand and we run away from the Cornucopia Where the sand ends woods begin to rise sharply No not really woods At least not the kind I know Jungle The foreign almost obsoleteword comes to mind Something I heard from another Hunger Games or learned from my father Most of the trees are unfamiliar with smooth trunks and few branches The earth is very black and spongy underfoot often obscured by tangles of vines with colorful blossoms While the suns hot and bright the airs warm and heavy with moisture and I get the feeling I will never really be dry here The thin blue fabric of my jumpsuit lets the seawater evaporate easily but its already begun to cling to me with sweat Peeta takes the lead cutting through the patches of dense vegetation with his long knife I make Finnick go second because even though hes the most powerful hes got his hands full with Mags Besides while hes a whiz with that trident its a weapon less suited to the jungle than my arrows It doesnt take long between the steep incline and the heat to become short of breath Peeta and I have been training intenselythough and Finnicks such an amazing physical specimen that even with Mags over his shoulder we climb rapidly for about a mile before he requests a rest And then I think its more for Magss sake than his own The foliage has hidden the wheel from sight so I scale a tree with rubbery limbs to get a better view And then wish that I hadnt Around the Cornucopia the ground appears to be bleeding the water has purple stains Bodies lie on the ground and float in the sea but at this distance with everyone dressed exactly the same I cant tell who lives or dies All I can tell is that some of the tiny blue figures still battle Well what did I think That the victors chain of locked hands last night would result in some sort of universal truce in the arena No I never believed that But I guess I had hoped people might show some  what Restraint Reluctance at least Before they jumped right into massacre mode And you all kneweach other I think You acted like friends I have only one real friend in here And he isnt from District  I let the slight soupy breeze cool my cheeks while I come to a decision Despite the bangle I should just get it over with and shoot Finnick Theres really no future in this alliance And hes too dangerous to let go Now when we have this tentative trust may be my only chance to kill him I could easily shoot him in the back as we walk Its despicable of course but will it be any more despicable if I wait Know him better Owe him more No this is the time I take one last look at the battling figures the bloody ground to harden my resolve and then slide to the ground But when I land I find Finnicks kept pace with my thoughts As if he knows what I have seen and how it will have affected me He has one of his tridents raised in a casually defensive position Whats going on down there Katniss Have they all joinedhands Taken a vow of nonviolence Tossed the weapons in the sea in defiance of the Capitol Finnick asks No Isay No Finnick repeats Because whatever happened in the past is in the past And no one in this arena was a victor by chance He eyes Peeta for a moment Except maybe Peeta Finnick knows then what Haymitch and I know About Peeta Being truly deepdown better than the rest of us Finnick took out that tribute from  without blinking an eye And how long did I take to turn deadly I shot to kill when I targeted Enobaria and Gloss and Brutus Peeta would at least have attempted negotiations first Seen if some wider alliance was possible But to what end Finnicks right Im right The people in this arena werent crowned for their compassion I hold his gaze weighing his speed against my own The time it will take to send an arrowthrough his brain versus the time his trident will reach my body I can see him waiting for me to make the first move Calculating if he should block first or go directly for an attack I can feel weve both about worked it out when Peeta steps deliberately between us So how many are dead he asks Move you idiot I think But he remains planted firmly between us Hard to say I answer At least six I think And theyre still fighting Lets keep moving We need water he says So far theres been no sign of a freshwater stream or pond and the saltwaters undrinkable Again I think of the last Games where I nearly died of dehydration Better find some soon says Finnick We need to be undercover when the others come hunting us tonight We Us Hunting All right maybe killing Finnick would be a little premature Hes been helpful so far He does have Haymitchs stamp of approval And who knows what thenight will hold If worse comes to worst I can always kill him in his sleep So I let the moment pass And so does Finnick The absence of water intensifies my thirst I keep a sharp eye out as we continue our trek upward but with no luck After about another mile I can see an end to the tree line and assume were reaching the crest of the hill Maybe well have better luck on the other side Find a spring or something But there is no other side I know this before anyone else even though I am farthest from the top My eyes catch on a funny rippling square hanging like a warped pane of glass in the air At first I think its the glare from the sun or the heat shimmering up off the ground But its fixed in space not shifting when I move And thats when I connect the square with Wiress and Beetee in the Training Center and realize what lies before us My warning cry is just reaching my lips when Peetas knife swings out to slash away somevines Theres a sharp zapping sound For an instant the trees are gone and I see open space over a short stretch of bare earth Then Peetas flung back from the force field bringing Finnick and Mags to the ground I rush over to where he lies motionless in a web of vines Peeta Theres a faint smellof singed hair I call his name again giving him a little shake but hes unresponsive My fingers fumble across his lips where theres no warm breath although moments ago he was panting I press my ear against his chest to the spot where I always rest my head where I know I will hear the strong and steady beat of his heart Instead I find silence Peeta I scream I shake him harder even resort to slapping his face but its no use His heart has failed I am slapping emptiness Peeta Finnick props Mags against a tree andpushes me out of the way Let me His fingers touch points at Peetas neck run over the bones in his ribs and spine Then he pinches Peetas nostrils shut No I yell hurling myself at Finnick for surely he intends to make certain that Peetas dead to keep any hope of life from returning to him Finnicks hand comes up and hits me so hard so squarely in the chest that I go flying back into a nearby tree trunk Im stunned for a moment by the pain by trying to regain my wind as I see Finnick close off Peetas nose again From where I sit I pull an arrow whip the notch into place and am about to let it fly when Im stopped by the sight of Finnick kissing Peeta And its so bizarre even for Finnick that I stay my hand No hes not kissing him Hes got Peetas nose blocked off but his mouth tilted open and hes blowing air into his lungs I can see this I can actually see Peetas chest rising and falling Then Finnick unzips thetop of Peetas jumpsuit and begins to pump the spot over his heart with the heels of his hands Now that Ive gotten through my shock I understand what hes trying to do Once in a blue moon Ive seen my mother try something similar but not often If your heart fails in District  its unlikely your family could get you to my mother in time anyway So her usual patients are burned or wounded or ill Or starving of course But Finnicks world is different Whatever hes doing hes done it before Theres a very set rhythm and method And I find the arrow tip sinking to the ground as I lean in to watch desperately for some sign of success Agonizing minutes drag past as my hopes diminish Around the time that Im deciding its too late that Peetas dead moved on unreachable forever he gives a small cough and Finnick sits back I leave my weapons in the dirt as I fling myself at him Peeta I say softly I brush thedamp blond strands of hair back from his forehead find the pulse drumming against my fingers at his neck His lashes flutter open and his eyes meet mine Careful he says weakly Theres a force field up ahead I laugh but there are tears running down my cheeks Must be a lot stronger than the one on the Training Center roof he says Im all right though Just a little shaken You were dead Your heart stopped I burst out before really considering if this is a good idea I clap my hand over my mouthbecause Im starting to make those awful choking sounds that happen when I sob Well it seems to be working now he says Its all right Katniss I nod my head but the sounds arent stopping Katniss Now Peetas worried about me which adds to the insanity of it all Its okay Its just her hormones says Finnick From the baby I look up and seehim sitting back on his knees but still panting a bit from the climb and the heat and the effort of bringing Peeta back from the dead No Its not I get out but Im cut off by an even more hysterical round of sobbing that seems only to confirm what Finnick said about the baby He meets my eyes and I glare at him through my tears Its stupid I know that his efforts make me so vexed All I wanted was to keep Peeta alive and I couldnt and Finnick could and I should be nothing but grateful And I am But I am also furious because it means that I will never stop owing Finnick Odair Ever So how can I kill him in hissleep I expect to see a smug or sarcastic expression on his face but his look is strangely quizzical He glances between Peeta and me as if trying to figure something out then gives his head a slight shake as if to clear it How areyou he asks Peeta Do you think you can move on No he has to rest I say My nose is running like crazy and I dont even have a shred of fabric to use as a handkerchief Mags rips off a handful of hanging moss from a tree limb and gives it to me Im too much of a mess to even question it I blow my nose loudly and mop the tears off my face Its nice the moss Absorbent and surprisingly soft I notice a gleam of gold on Peetas chest I reach out and retrieve the disk that hangs from a chain around his neck My mockingjay has been engraved on it Is this your token I ask Yes Do you mind that I used your mockingjay I wanted us to match he says No of course I dont mind I force a smile Peeta showing up in the arena wearing a mockingjay is both a blessing and a curse On the one hand it should give a boost to the rebels in the district On the other its hard to imagine President Snow will overlook it and that makes the job ofkeeping Peeta alive harder So you want to make camp here then Finnick asks I dont think thats an option Peeta answers Staying here With no water No protection I feel all right really If we could just go slowly Slowly would be better than not at all Finnick helps Peeta to his feet while I pull myself together Since I got up this morning Ive watched Cinna beaten to a pulp landed in another arena and seen Peeta die Still Im glad Finnick keeps playing the pregnancy card for me because from a sponsors point of view Im not handling things all that well I check over my weapons which I know are in perfect condition because it makes me seem more in control Ill take the lead I announce Peeta starts to object but Finnick cuts him off No let her do it He frowns at me You knew that force field was there didnt you Right at the last second You started to give a warning I nod How did you know I hesitate Toreveal that I know Beetee and Wiresss trick of recognizing a force field could be dangerous I dont know if the Gamemakers made note of that moment during training when the two pointed it out to me or not One way or the other I have a very valuable piece of information And if they know I have it they might do something to alter the force field so I cant see the aberration anymore So I lie I dont know Its almost as if I could hear it Listen We all become still Theres the sound of insects birds the breeze in the foliage I dont hear anything says Peeta Yes I insist its like when the fence around District Twelve is on only much much quieter Everyone listens again intently I do too although theres nothing to hear There I say Cant you hearit Its coming from right where Peeta got shocked Idont hear it either says Finnick But if you do by all means take the lead I decide to play this for all its worth Thats weird I say I turn my head from side to side as if puzzled I can only hear it out of my left ear The one the doctors reconstructed asks Peeta Yeah I say then give a shrug Maybe they did a better job than they thought You know sometimes I do hear funny things on that side Things you wouldnt ordinarily think have a sound Like insect wings Or snow hitting the ground Perfect Now all the attention will turn to the surgeons who fixed my deaf ear after the Games last year and theyll have to explain why I can hear like a bat You says Mags nudging me forward so I take the lead Since were to be moving slowly Mags prefers to walk with the aid of a branch Finnick quickly fashions into a cane for her He makes a staff for Peeta as well which is good because despite his protestations I think all Peetareally wants to do is lie down Finnick brings up the rear so at least someone alert has our backs I walk with the force field on my left because thats supposed to be the side with my superhuman ear But since thats all made up I cut down a bunch of hard nuts that hang like grapes from a nearby tree and toss them ahead of me as I go Its good I do too because I have a feeling Im missing the patches that indicate the force field more often than Im spotting them Whenever a nut hits the force field theres a puff of smoke before the nut lands blackened and with a cracked shell on the ground at my feet After a few minutes I become aware of a smacking sound behind me and turn to see Mags peeling the shell off one of the nuts and popping it in her alreadyfull mouth Mags I cry Spit that out It could be poisonous She mumbles something and ignores me licking her lips with apparent relish I look to Finnick for help but he just laughsI guess well find out he says I go forward wondering about Finnick who saved old Mags but will let her eat strange nuts Who Haymitch has stamped with his seal of approval Who brought Peeta back from the dead Why didnt he just let him die He would have been blameless I never would have guessed it was in his power to revive him Why could he possibly have wanted to save Peeta And why was he so determined to team up with me Willing to kill me too if it comes to that But leaving the choice of if we fight to me I keep walking tossing my nuts sometimes catching a glimpse of the force field trying to press to the left to find a spot where we can break through get away from the Cornucopia and hopefully find water But after another hour or so of this I realize its futile Were not making any progress to the left In fact the force field seems to be herding us along a curved path I stop and look back atMagss limping form the sheen ofsweat on Peetas face Lets take a break I say I need to get another look from above The tree I choose seems to jut higher into the air than the others I make my way up the twisting boughs staying as close to the trunk as possible No telling how easily these rubbery branches will snap Still I climb beyond good sense because theres something I have to see As I cling to a stretch of trunk no wider than a sapling swaying back and forth in the humid breeze my suspicions are confirmed Theres a reason we cant turn to the left will never be able to From this precarious vantage point I can see the shape of the whole arena for the first time A perfect circle With a perfect wheel in the middle The sky above the circumference of the jungle is tinged a uniform pink And I think I can make out one or two of those wavy squareschinks in the armor Wiress and Beetee called them because they reveal what was meant to be hidden and are therefore a weakness Just to make absolutely sure I shoot an arrow into the empty space above the tree line Theres a spurt of light a flash of real blue sky and the arrows thrown back into the jungle I climb down to give the others the bad news The force field has us trapped in a circle A dome really I dont know how high it goes Theres the Cornucopia the sea and then the jungle all around Very exact Very symmetrical And not very large I say Did you see any water asks Finnick Only the saltwater where we started the Games I say There must be some other source says Peeta frowning Or well all be dead in a matter of days Well the foliage is thick Maybe there are ponds or springs somewhere I say doubtfully I instinctively feel the Capitol might want these unpopular Games over as soon as possiblePlutarch Heavensbee might have already been given orders to knock us off At any rate theres no point in trying to find out whats over the edge of this hill because the answer is nothing There must be drinkable water between the force field and the wheel Peeta insists We all know what this means Heading back down Heading back to the Careers and the bloodshed With Mags hardly able to walk and Peeta too weak to fight We decide to move down the slope a few hundred yards and continue circling See if maybe theres some water at that level I stay in the lead occasionally chucking a nut to my left but were well out of range of the force field now The sun beats down on us turning the air to steam playing tricks on our eyes By midafternoon its clear Peeta and Mags cant go on Finnick chooses a campsite about ten yards below the force field saying we can use it as a weapon by deflecting our enemies into it if attacked Thenhe and Mags pull blades of the sharp grass that grows in fivefoothigh tufts and begin to weave them together into mats Since Mags seems to have no ill effects from the nuts Peeta collects bunches of themand fries them by bouncing them off the force field He methodically peels off the shells piling the meats on a leaf I stand guard fidgety and hot and raw with the emotions of the day Thirsty I am so thirsty Finally I cant stand it anymore Finnick why dont you stand guard and Ill hunt around some more for water I say No ones thrilled with the idea of me going off alone but the threat of dehydration hangs over us Dont worry I wont go far I promise Peeta Ill go too he says No Im going to do some hunting if I can I tell him I dont add And you cant come because youre too loud But its implied He would both scare offprey and endanger me with his heavy tread I wont be long I move stealthily through the trees happy to find that the ground lends itself to soundless footsteps I work my way down at a diagonal but I find nothing except more lush green plant life The sound of the cannon brings me to a halt The initial bloodbath at the Cornucopia must be over The death toll of the tributes is now available I count the shots each representing one dead victor Eight Not as many as last year But it seems like more since I know most of their names Suddenly weak I lean against a tree to rest feeling the heat draw the moisture from my body like a sponge Already swallowing is difficult and fatigue is creeping up on me I try rubbing my hand across my belly hoping some sympathetic pregnant woman will become my sponsor and Haymitch can send in some water No luck I sink to the ground In my stillness I begin to notice the animalsstrange birds with brilliant plumage tree lizards with flickering blue tongues and something that looks like a cross between a rat and a possum clinging on the branches close to the trunk I shoot one of the latter out of a tree to get a closer look Its ugly all right a big rodent with a fuzz of mottled gray fur and two wickedlooking gnawing teeth protruding over its lower lip As Im gutting and skinning it I notice something else Its muzzle is wet Like an animal thats been drinking from a stream Excited I start at its home tree and move slowly out in a spiral It cant be far the creatures water source Nothing I find nothing Not so much as a dewdrop Eventually because I know Peeta will be worried about me I head back to the camp hotter and more frustrated than ever When I arrive I see the others have transformed the place Mags and Finnick have created a hut of sorts out of the grass mats open on one side but withthree walls a floor and a roof Mags has also plaited several bowls that Peeta has filled with roasted nuts Their faces turn to me hopefully but I give my head a shake No No water Its out there though He knew where it was I say hoisting the skinned rodent up for all to see Hed been drinking recently when I shot him out of a tree but I couldnt find his source I swear I covered everyinch of ground in a thirtyyard radius Can we eat him Peeta asks I dont know for sure But his meat doesnt look that different from a squirrels He ought to be cooked  I hesitate as I think of trying to start a fire out here from complete scratch Even if I succeed theres the smoke to think about Were all so close together in this arena theres no chance of hiding it Peeta has another idea He takes a cube of rodent meat skewers it on the tip of a pointed stickand lets it fall into the force field Theres a sharp sizzle and the stick flies back The chunk of meat is blackened on the outside but well cooked inside We give him a round of applause then quickly stop remembering where we areThe white sun sinks in the rosy sky as we gather in the hut Im still leery about the nuts but Finnick says Mags recognized them from another Games I didnt bother spending time at the edibleplants station in training because it was so effortless for me last year Now I wish I had For surely there would have been some of the unfamiliar plants surrounding me And I might have guessed a bit more about where I was headed Mags seems fine though and shes been eating the nuts for hours So I pick one up and take a small bite It has a mild slightly sweet flavor that reminds me of a chestnut I decide its all right The rodents strong andgamey but surprisingly juicy Really its not a bad meal for our first night in the arena If only we had something to wash it down with Finnick asks a lot of questions about the rodent which we decide to call a tree rat How high was it how long did I watch it before I shot and what was it doing I dont remember it doing much of anything Snuffling around for insects or something Im dreading the night At least the tightly woven grass offers some protection from whatever slinks across the jungle floor after hours But a short time before the sun slips below the horizon a pale white moon rises making things just visible enough Our conversation trails off because we know whats coming We position ourselves in a line at the mouth of the hut and Peeta slips his hand into mine The sky brightens when the seal of the Capitol appears as if floating in space As I listen to the strains of the anthem I think It will be harderfor Finnick and Mags But it turns out to be plenty hard for me as well Seeing the faces of the eight dead victors projected into the sky The man from District  the one Finnick took out with his trident is the first to appear That means that all the tributes in  through  are alive  the four Careers Beetee and Wiress and of course Mags and Finnick The man from District  is followed by the male morphling from  Cecelia and Woof from  both from  the woman from  and Seeder from  The Capitol seal is back with a final bit of music and then the sky goes dark except for the moon No one speaks I cant pretend I knew any of them well But Im thinking of those three kids hanging on to Cecelia when they took her away Seeders kindness to me at our meeting Even the thought of the glazedeyed morphling painting my cheeks with yellow flowers gives me a pang All dead All gone I dont know how long we might have sat hereif it werent for the arrival of the silver parachute which glides down through the foliage to land before us No one reaches for it Whose is it do you think I say finally No telling says Finnick Why dont we let Peeta claim it since he died today Peeta unties the cord and flattens out the circle of silk On the parachute sits a small metal object that I cant place What is it I ask No one knows Wepass it from hand to hand taking turns examining it Its a hollow metal tube tapered slightly at one end On the other end a small lip curves downward Its vaguely familiar A part that could have fallen off a bicycle a curtain rod anything really Peeta blows on one end to see if it makes a sound It doesnt Finnick slides his pinkie into it testing it out as a weapon Useless Can you fish with it Mags I ask Mags who can fish with almost anything shakes her headand grunts I take it and roll it back and forth on my palm Since were allies Haymitch will be working with the District  mentors He had a hand in choosing this gift That means its valuable Lifesaving even I think back to last year when I wanted water so badly but he wouldnt send it because he knew I could find it if I tried Haymitchs gifts or lack thereof carry weighty messages I can almost hear him growling at me Use your brain if you have one What is it I wipe the sweat from my eyes and hold the gift out in the moonlight I move it this way and that viewing it from different angles covering portions and then revealing them Trying to make it divulge its purpose to me Finally in frustration I jam one end into the dirt I give up Maybe if we hook up with Beetee or Wiress they can figure it out I stretch out pressing my hot cheek on the grass mat staring at the thing in aggravation Peeta rubs a tense spot betweenmy shoulders and I let myself relax a little I wonder why this place hasnt cooled off at all now that the suns gone down I wonder whats going on back home Prim My mother Gale Madge I think of them watching me from home At least I hope theyre at home Not taken into custody by Thread Being punished as Cinna is As Darius is Punished because of me Everybody I begin to ache for them for my district for my woods A decent woods with sturdy hardwood trees plentiful food game that isnt creepy Rushing streams Cool breezes No cold winds to blow this stifling heat away I conjure up such a wind in my mind letting it freeze my cheeks and numb my fingers and all at once the piece of metal half buried in the black earth has a name A spile I exclaim sitting bolt upright What asks Finnick I wrestle the thing from the ground and brush it clean Cup my hand around the tapered end concealing itand look at the lip Yes Ive seen one of these before On a cold windy day long ago when I was out in the woods with my father Inserted snugly into a hole drilled in the side of a maple A pathway for the sap to follow as it flowed into our bucket Maple syrup could make even our dull bread a treat After my father died I didnt know what happened to the handful of spiles he had Hidden out in the woods somewhere probably Never to be found Its a spile Sort of like a faucet You put it in a tree and sap comes out I look at the sinewy green trunks around me Well the rightsort of tree Sap asks Finnick They dont have the right kind of trees by the sea either To make syrup says Peeta But there must be something else inside these trees Were all on our feet at once Our thirst The lack of springs The tree rats sharp front teeth and wet muzzle There canonly be one thing worth having inside these trees Finnick goes to hammer the spile into the green bark of a massive tree with a rock but I stop him Wait You might damage it We need to drill a hole first I say Theres nothing to drill with so Mags offers her awl and Peeta drives it straight into the bark burying the spike two inches deep He and Finnick take turns opening up the hole with the awl and the knives until it can hold the spile I wedge it in carefully and we all stand back in anticipation At first nothing happens Then a drop of water rolls down the lip and lands in Magss palm She licks it off and holds out her hand for more By wiggling and adjusting the spile we get a thin stream running out We take turns holding our mouths under the tap wetting our parched tongues Mags brings over a basket and the grass is so tightly woven it holds water We fill the basket and pass it around taking deep gulps and laterluxuriously splashing our faces clean Like everything here the waters on the warm side but this is no time to be picky Without our thirst to distract us were all aware of how exhausted we are and make preparations for the night Last year I always tried to have my gear ready in case I had to make a speedy retreat in the night This year theres no backpack to prepare Just my weapons which wont leave my grasp anyway Then I think of the spile and wrest it from the tree trunk I strip a tough vine of its leaves thread it through the hollow center and tie the spile securely to my belt Finnick offers to take the first watch and I let him knowing it has to be one of the two of us until Peetas rested up I lie down beside Peeta on the floor of the hut telling Finnick to wake me when hes tired Instead I find myself jarred from sleep a few hours later by what seems to be the tolling of a bell Bong Bong Its not exactly like the one theyring in the Justice Building on New Years but close enough for me to recognize it Peeta and Mags sleep through it but Finnick has the same look of attentiveness I feel The tolling stops I counted twelve he says I nod Twelve What does that signify One ring for each district Maybe But why Mean anything do you think No idea he says We wait for further instructions maybe a message from Claudius Templesmith An invitation to a feast The only thing of note appears in the distance A dazzling bolt of electricity strikes a towering tree and then a lightning storm begins I guess its an indication of rain of a water source for those who dont have mentors as smart as Haymitch Go to sleep Finnick Its myturn to watch anyway I say Finnick hesitates but no one can stay awake forever He settles down at the mouth ofthe hut one hand gripped around a trident and drifts into a restless sleep I sit with my bow loaded watching the jungle which is ghostly pale and green in the moonlight After an hour or so the lightning stops I can hear the rain coming in though pattering on the leaves a few hundred yards away I keep waiting for it to reach us but it never does The sound of the cannon startles me although it makes little impression on my sleeping companions Theres no point in awakening them for this Another victor dead I dont even allow myself to wonder who it is The elusive rain shuts off suddenly like the storm did last year in the arena Moments after it stops I see the fog sliding softly in from the direction of the recent downpour Just a reaction Cool rain on the steaming ground I think It continues to approach at a steady pace Tendrils reach forward and then curl like fingers as if they are pulling the rest behind them As Iwatch I feel the hairs on my neck begin to rise Somethings wrong with this fog The progression of the front line is too uniform to be natural And if its not natural  A sickeningly sweet odor begins to invade my nostrils and I reach for the others shouting for them to wake up In the few seconds it takes to rouse them I begin to blister Tiny searing stabs Wherever the droplets of mist touch my skin Run I scream at the others Run Finnick snaps awake instantly rising to counter an enemy But when he sees the wall of fog he tosses a stillsleeping Mags onto his back and takes off Peeta is on his feet but not as alert I grab his arm and begin to propel him through the jungle after Finnick What is it What is it he says in bewilderment Some kind of fog Poisonous gas Hurry Peeta I urge I can tell that however much he denied it during the day the aftereffects of hitting the force field have been significant Hes slow muchslower than usual And the tangle of vines and undergrowth which unbalance me occasionally trip him at every step I look back at the wall of fog extending in a straight line as far as I can see in either direction A terrible impulse to flee to abandon Peeta and save myself shoots through me It would be so simple to run full out perhaps to even climb a tree above the fog line which seems to top out at about forty feet I remember how I did just this when the muttations appeared in the last Games Took off and only thought of Peeta when Id reached the Cornucopia But this time I trap my terror push it down and stay by his side This time my survival isnt the goal Peetas is I think of the eyes glued to the television screens in the districts seeing if I will run as the Capitol wishes or hold my ground I lock my fingers tightly into his and say Watch my feet Just try to step where Istep It helps We seem to move a little faster but never enough to afford a rest and the mist continues to lap at our heels Droplets spring free of the body of vapor They burn but not like fire Less a sense of heat and more of intense pain as the chemicals find our flesh cling to it and burrow down through the layers of skin Our jumpsuits are no help at all We may as well be dressed in tissue paper for all the protection they give Finnick who bounded off initially stops when he realizes were having problems But this is not a thing you can fight only evade He shouts encouragement trying to move us along and the sound of his voice acts as a guide though little more Peetas artificial leg catches in a knot of creepers and he sprawls forward before I can catch him As I help him up I become aware of something scarier than the blisters more debilitating than the burns The left side of his face has sagged as if everymuscle in it has died The lid droops almost concealing his eye His mouthtwists in an odd angle toward the ground Peeta I begin And thats when I feel the spasms run up my arm Whatever chemical laces the fog does more than burn  it targets our nerves A whole new kind of fear shoots through me and I yank Peeta forward which only causes him to stumble again By the time I get him to his feet both of my arms are twitching uncontrollably The fog has moved in on us the body of it less than a yard away Something is wrong with Peetas legs hes trying to walk but they move in a spastic puppetlike fashion I feel him lurch forward and realize Finnick has come back for us and is hauling Peeta along I wedge my shoulder which still seems under my control under Peetas arm and do my best to keep up withFinnicks rapid pace We put about ten yards between us and the fog when Finnick stops Its no good Ill have to carry him Can you take Mags he asks me Yes I say stoutly although my heart sinks Its true that Mags cant weigh more than about seventy pounds but Im not very big myself Still Im sure Ive carried heavier loads If only my arms would stop jumping around I squat down and she positions herself over my shoulder the way she rides on Finnick I slowly straighten my legs and with my knees locked I can manage her Finnick has Peeta slung across his back now and we move forward Finnick leading me following in the trail he breaks through the vines On the fog comes silent and steady and flat except for the grasping tendrils Although my instinct is to run directly away from it I realize Finnick is moving at a diagonal down the hill Hes trying to keep a distance from the gas while steering ustoward the water that surrounds the Cornucopia Yes water I think as the acid droplets bore deeper into me Now Im so thankful I didnt kill Finnick because how would I have gotten Peeta out of here alive So thankful to have someone else on my side even if its only temporarily Its not Magss fault when I begin falling Shes doing everything she can to be an easy passenger but the fact is there is only so much weight I can handle Especially now that my right leg seems to be going stiff The first two times I crash to the ground I manage to make it back on my feet but the third time I cannot get my leg to cooperate As I struggle to get up it gives out and Mags rolls off onto the ground before me I flail around trying to use vines and trunks to right myself Finnicks back by my side Peeta hanging over him Its no use I say Can you take them both Go on ahead Ill catch up A somewhat doubtful proposal but I say it with as muchsurety as I can muster I can see Finnicks eyes green in the moonlight I can see them as clear as day Almost like a cats with a strange reflective quality Maybe because they are shiny with tears No he says I cant carry them both My arms arent working Its true His arms jerk uncontrollably at hissides His hands are empty Of his three tridents only one remains and its in Peetas hands Im sorry Mags I cant do it What happens next is so fast so senseless I cant even move to stop it Mags hauls herself up plants a kiss on Finnicks lips and then hobbles straight into the fog Immediately her body is seized by wild contortions and she falls to the ground in a horrible dance I want to scream but my throat is on fire I take one futile step in her direction when I hear the cannon blast know her heart has stoppedthat she is dead Finnick I call out hoarsely but he has already turned from the scene already continued his retreat from the fog Dragging my useless leg behind me I stagger after him having no idea what else to do Time and space lose meaning as the fog seems to invade my brain muddling my thoughts making everything unreal Some deeprooted animal desire for survival keeps me stumbling after Finnick and Peeta continuing to move although Im probably dead already Parts of me are dead or clearly dying And Mags is dead This is something I know or maybe just think I know because it makes no sense at all Moonlight glinting on Finnicks bronze hair beads of searing pain peppering me a leg turned to wood I follow Finnick until he collapses on the ground Peeta still on top of him I seem to have no ability to stop my own forward motion and simply propel myself onward until I trip over their prone bodiesjust one more on the heap This is where and how and when we all die I think But the thought is abstract and far less alarming than the current agonies of my body I hear Finnick groan and manage to drag myself off the others Now I can see the wall of fog which has taken on a pearly white quality Maybe its my eyes playing tricks or the moonlight but the fog seems to be transforming Yes its becoming thicker as if it has pressed up against a glass window and is being forced to condense I squint harder and realize the fingers no longer protrude from it In fact it has stopped moving forward entirely Like other horrors I have witnessed in the arena it has reached the end of its territory Either that or the Gamemakers have decided not to kill us just yet Its stopped I try to say but only an awful croaking sound comes from my swollen mouth Its stopped I say again and this time I must be clearerbecause both Peeta and Finnick turn their heads to the fog It begins to rise upward now as if being slowly vacuumed into the sky We watch until it has all been sucked away and not the slightest wisp remains Peeta rolls off Finnick who turns over onto his back We lie there gasping twitching our minds and bodies invaded by the poison After a few minutes pass Peeta vaguely gestures upward Monhees I look up and spot a pair of what I guess are monkeys I have never seen a live monkey theres nothing like that in our woods at home But I must have seen apicture or one in the Games because when I see the creatures the same word comes to my mind I think these have orange fur although its hard to tell and are about half the size of a fullgrown human I take the monkeys for a good sign Surely they would not hang around if the air wasdeadly For a while we quietly observe one another humans and monkeys Then Peeta struggles to his knees and crawls down the slope We all crawl since walking now seems as remarkable a feat as flying we crawl until the vines turn to a narrow strip of sandy beach and the warm water that surrounds the Cornucopia laps our faces I jerk back as if Ive touched an open flame Rubbing salt in a wound For the first time I truly appreciate the expression because the salt in the water makes the pain of my wounds so blinding I nearly black out But theres another sensation of drawing out I experiment by gingerly placing only my hand in the water Torturous yes but then less so And through the blue layer of water I see a milky substance leaching out of the wounds on my skin As the whiteness diminishes so does the pain I unbuckle my belt and strip off my jumpsuit which is little more than a perforated rag My shoes andundergarments are inexplicably unaffected Little by little one small portion of a limb at a time I soak the poison out of my wounds Peeta seems to be doing the same But Finnick backed away from the water at first touch and lies facedown on the sand either unwilling or unable to purge himself Finally when I have survived the worst opening my eyes underwater sniffing water into my sinuses and snorting it out and even gargling repeatedly to wash out my throat Im functional enough to help Finnick Some feeling has returned to my leg but my arms are still riddled with spasms I cant drag Finnick into the water and possibly the pain would kill him anyway So I scoop up shaky handfuls and empty them on his fists Since hes not underwater the poison comes out of his wounds just as it went in in wisps of fog that I take great care to steer clear of Peeta recovers enough to help me He cuts away Finnicks jumpsuitSomewhere he finds two shells that work much better than our hands do We concentrate on soaking Finnicks arms first since they have been so badly damaged and even though a lot of white stuff pours out of them he doesnt notice He just lies there eyes shut giving an occasional moan I look around with growing awareness of how dangerous a position were in Its night yes but this moon gives off too much light for concealment Were lucky no ones attacked us yet We could see them coming from the Cornucopia but if all four Careers attacked theyd overpower us If they didnt spot us at first Finnicks moans would give us away soon Weve got to get more of him into the water I whisper But we cant put him in facefirst not while hes in this condition Peeta nods to Finnicks feet Weeach take one pull him one hundred and eightydegrees around and start to drag him into the saltwater Just a few inches at a time His ankles Wait a few minutes Up to his midcalf Wait His knees Clouds of white swirl out from his flesh and he groans We continue to detoxify him bit by bit What I find is that the longer I sit in the water the better I feel Not just my skin but my brain and muscle control continue to improve I can see Peetas face beginning to return to normal his eyelid opening the grimace leaving his mouth Finnick slowly begins to revive His eyes open focus on us and register awareness that hes being helped I rest his head on my lap and we let him soak about ten minutes with everything immersed from the neck down Peeta and I exchange a smile as Finnick lifts his arms above the seawater Theres just your head left Finnick Thats the worst part but youll feel much better after if you can bear it Peeta says We help him to sit up and let himgrip our hands as he purges his eyes and nose and mouth His throat is still too raw to speak Im going to try to tap a tree I say My fingers fumble at my belt and find the spile still hanging from its vine Let me make the hole first says Peeta You stay with him Youre the healer Thats a joke I think But I dont say it out loud since Finnick has enough to deal with He got the worst of the fog although Im not sure why Maybe because hes the biggest or maybe because he had to exert himself the most And then of course theres Mags I still dont understand what happened there Why he essentially abandoned her to carry Peeta Why she not only didnt question it but ran straight to her death without a moments hesitation Was it because she was so old that her days were numbered anyway Did they think that Finnick would stand a better chance of winning if he had Peeta and me as allies The haggard look on Finnicks facetells me that now is not the moment to ask Instead I try to put myself back together I rescue my mockingjay pin from my ruined jumpsuit and pin it to the strap of my undershirt The flotation belt must be acid resistant since it looks as good as new I can swim so the flotation belts not really necessary but Brutus blocked my arrow with his so I buckle it back on thinking it might offer some protection I undo my hair and comb it with my fingers thinning it out considerably since the fog droplets damaged it Then I braid back whats left of it Peeta has found a good tree about ten yards from the narrow strip of beach We can hardly see him but the sound of his knife against the wooden trunk is crystal clear I wonder what happened to the awl Mags mustve either dropped it or taken it into the fog with her Anyway its gone I have moved out a bit farther into the shallows floating alternately on my belly and back If the seawaterhealed Peeta and me it seems to be transformingFinnick altogether He begins to move slowly just testing his limbs and gradually begins to swim But its not like me swimming the rhythmic strokes the even pace Its like watching some strange sea animal coming back to life He dives and surfaces spraying water out of his mouth rolls over and over in some bizarre corkscrew motion that makes me dizzy even to watch And then when hes been underwater so long I feel certain hes drowned his head pops up right next to me and I start Dont do that I say What Come up or stay under he says Either Neither Whatever Just soak in the water and behave I say Or if you feel this good lets go help Peeta In just the short time it takes to cross to the edge of the jungle I become aware of the change Put it down to years of hunting or maybe myreconstructed ear does work a little better than anyone intended But I sense the mass of warm bodies poised above us They dont need to chatter or scream The mere breathing of so many is enough I touch Finnicks arm and he follows my gaze upward I dont know how they arrived so silently Perhaps they didnt Weve all been absorbed in restoring our bodies During that time theyve assembled Not five or ten but scores of monkeys weigh down the limbs of the jungle trees The pair we spotted when we first escaped the fog felt like a welcoming committee This crew feels ominous I arm my bow with two arrows and Finnick adjusts the trident in his hand Peeta I say as calmly as possible I need your help with something Okay just a minute I think Ive just about got it he says still occupied with the tree Yes there Have you got the spile I do But weve found something youd better take a look atI continue in a measured voice Only move toward us quietly so you dont startle it For somereason I dont want him to notice the monkeys or even glance their way There are creatures that interpret mere eye contact as aggression Peeta turns to us panting from his work on the tree The tone of my request is so odd that its alerted him to some irregularity Okay he says casually He begins to move through the jungle and although I know hes trying hard to be quiet this has never been his strong suit even when he had two sound legs But its all right hes moving the monkeys are holding their positions Hes just five yards from the beach when he senses them His eyes only dart up for a second but its as if hes triggered a bomb The monkeys explode into a shrieking mass of orange fur and converge on him Ive never seen anyanimal move so fast They slide down the vines as if the things were greased Leap impossible distances from tree to tree Fangs bared hackles raised claws shooting out like switchblades I may be unfamiliar with monkeys but animals in nature dont act like this Mutts I spit out as Finnick and I crash into the greenery I know every arrow must count and they do In the eerie light I bring down monkey after monkey targeting eyes and hearts and throats so that each hit means a death But still it wouldnt be enough without Finnick spearing the beasts like fish and flinging them aside Peeta slashing away with his knife I feel claws on my leg down my back before someone takes out the attacker The air grows heavy with trampled plants the scent of blood and the musty stink of the monkeys Peeta and Finnick and I position ourselves in a triangle a few yards apart our backs to one another My heart sinks as myfingers draw back my last arrow Then I remember Peeta has a sheath too And hes not shooting hes hacking away with that knife My own knife is out now but the monkeys are quicker can spring in and out so fast you can barely react Peeta I shout Your arrows Peeta turns to see my predicament and is sliding off his sheath when it happens A monkey lunges out of a tree for his chest I have no arrow no way to shoot I can hear the thud of Finnicks trident finding another mark and know his weapon is occupied Peetas knife arm is disabled as he tries to remove the sheath I throw my knife at the oncoming mutt but the creature somersaults evading the blade and stays on its trajectory Weaponless defenseless I do the only thing I can think of I run for Peeta to knock him to the ground to protect his body with mine even though I know I wont make it in time She does though Materializing it seemsfrom thin air One moment nowhere the next reeling in front of Peeta Already bloody mouth open in a highpitched scream pupils enlarged so her eyes seem like black holes The insane morphling from District  throws up her skeletal arms as if to embrace the monkey and it sinks its fangs into her chest Peeta drops the sheath and buries hisknife into the monkeys back stabbing it again and again until it releases its jaw He kicks the mutt away bracing for more I have his arrows now a loaded bow and Finnick at my back breathing hard but not actively engaged Come on then Come on shouts Peeta panting with rage But something has happened to the monkeys They are withdrawing backing up trees fading into the jungle as if some unheard voice calls them away A Gamemakers voice telling them this is enough Get her I say to Peeta Wellcover you Peeta gently lifts up the morphling and carries her the last few yards to the beach while Finnick and I keep our weapons at the ready But except for the orange carcasses on the ground the monkeys are gone Peeta lays the morphling on the sand I cut away the material over her chest revealing the four deep puncture wounds Blood slowly trickles from them making them look far less deadly than they are The real damage is inside By the position of the openings I feel certain the beast ruptured something vital a lung maybe even her heart She lies on the sand gasping like a fish out of water Sagging skin sickly green her ribs as prominent as a childs dead of starvation Surely she could afford food but turned to the morphling just as Haymitch turned to drink I guess Everything about her speaks of wasteher body her life the vacant look in her eyes I hold one of her twitching hands unclear whether itmoves from the poison that affected our nerves the shock of the attack or withdrawal from the drug that was her sustenance There is nothing we can do Nothing but stay with her while she dies Ill watch the trees Finnick says before walking away Id like to walk away too but she grips my hand so tightly I would have to pry off her fingers and I dont have the strength for that kind of cruelty I think of Rue how maybe I could sing a song or something But I dont even know the morphlings name let alone if she likes songs I just know shes dying Peeta crouches down on the other side of her and strokes her hair When he begins to speak in a soft voice it seems almost nonsensical but the words arent for me With my paint box at home I can make every color imaginable Pink As pale as a babys skin Or as deep as rhubarb Green like spring grass Blue that shimmers like ice on water The morphling stares into Peetas eyes hanging onto his words One time I spent three days mixing paint until I found the right shade for sunlight on white fur You see I kept thinking it was yellow but it was much more than that Layers of all sorts of color One by one says Peeta The morphlings breathing is slowing into shallow catchbreaths Her free hand dabbles in the blood on her chest making the tiny swirling motions she so loved to paint with I havent figured out a rainbow yet They come so quickly and leave so soon I never have enough time to capture them Justa bit of blue here or purple there And then they fade away again Back into the air says Peeta The morphling seems mesmerized by Peetas words Entranced She lifts up a trembling hand and paints what I think might be a flower on Peetas cheek Thank you he whispers That looks beautiful For a moment the morphlings face lights up in agrin and she makes a small squeaking sound Then her blooddappled hand falls back onto her chest she gives one last huff of air and the cannon fires The grip on my hand releases Peeta carries her out into the water He returns and sits beside me The morphling floats out toward the Cornucopia for a while then the hovercraft appears and a fourpronged claw drops encases her carries her into the night sky and shes gone Finnick rejoins us his fist full of my arrows still wet with monkey blood He drops them beside me on the sand Thought you might want these Thanks I say I wade into the water and wash off the gore from my weapons my wounds By the time I return to the jungle to gather some moss to dry them all the monkeys bodies have vanished Where did they go I ask We dont know exactly The vines shifted and they were gone says Finnick We stare at the jungle numb and exhausted In the quiet I notice thatthe spots where the fog droplets touched my skin have scabbed over Theyve stopped hurting and begun to itch Intensely I try to think of this as a good sign That they are healing I glance over at Peeta at Finnick and see theyre both scratching at their damaged faces Yes even Finnicks beauty has been marred by this night Dont scratch I say wanting badly to scratch myself But I know its the advice my mother would give Youll only bring infection Think its safe to try for the water again We make our way back to the tree Peeta was tapping Finnick and I stand with our weapons poised while he works the spile in but no threat appears Peetas found a good vein and the water begins to gush from the spile We slake our thirst let the warm water pour over our itching bodies We fill a handful of shells with drinking water and go back to the beach Its still night though dawn cant be too many hours away Unless the Gamemakers wantit to be Why dont you two get some rest I say Ill watch for a while No Katniss Id rather says Finnick I look in his eyes at his face and realize hes barely holding back tears Mags The least I can do is give him the privacy to mourn her All right Finnick thanks I say I lie down on the sand with Peeta who drifts off at once I stare into the night thinking of what a difference a day makes How yesterday morning Finnick was on my kill list and now Im willing to sleep with him as my guard He saved Peeta and let Mags die and I dont know why Only that I can never settle the balance owed between us All I can do at the moment is go to sleep and let himgrieve in peace And so I do Its midmorning when I open my eyes again Peetas still out beside me Above us a mat of grass suspended on branches shields our faces fromthe sunlight I sit up and see that Finnicks hands have not been idle Two woven bowls are filled with fresh water A third holds a mess of shellfish Finnick sits on the sand cracking them open with a stone Theyre better fresh he says ripping a chunk of flesh from a shell and popping it into his mouth His eyes are still puffy but I pretend not to notice My stomach begins to growl at the smell of food and I reach for one The sight of my fingernails caked with blood stops me Ive been scratching my skin raw in my sleep You know if you scratch youll bring on infection says Finnick Thats what Ive heard I say I go into the saltwater and wash off the blood trying to decide which I hate more pain or itching Fed up I stomp back onto the beach turn my face upward and snap Hey Haymitch if youre not too drunk we could use a little something for our skin Its almost funny how quickly the parachute appears above meI reach up and the tube lands squarely in my open hand About time I say but I cant keep the scowl on my face Haymitch What I wouldnt give for five minutes of conversation with him I plunk down on the sand next to Finnick and screw the lid off the tube Inside is a thick dark ointment with a pungent smell a combination of tar and pine needles I wrinkle my nose as I squeeze a glob of the medicine onto my palm and begin to massage it into my leg A sound of pleasure slips out of my mouth as the stuff eradicates my itching It also stains my scabby skin a ghastly graygreen As I start on the second leg I toss the tube to Finnick who eyes me doubtfully Its like youre decomposing says Finnick But I guess the itching wins out because after a minute Finnick begins to treat his own skin too Really the combination of the scabs and the ointment looks hideous I cant help enjoying his distress PoorFinnick Is this the first time in your life you havent looked pretty I say It must be The sensations completely new How have you managed it all these years he asks Just avoid mirrors Youll forget about it I say Not if I keep looking at you he says We slather ourselves down even taking turns rubbing the ointment into each others backs where the undershirts dont protect our skin Im going to wake Peeta I say No wait says Finnick Lets do it together Put our faces right in front of his Well theres so little opportunity for fun left in my life I agree We position ourselves on either side of Peeta lean over until our faces are inches from his nose and give him a shake Peeta Peeta wake up I say in a soft singsong voice His eyelids flutter open and then he jumps like weve stabbed him Aa Finnick and I fall back in the sandlaughing our heads off Every time we try to stop we look at Peetas attempt to maintain a disdainful expression and it sets us off again By the time we pull ourselves together Im thinking that maybe Finnick Odair is all right At least not as vain or selfimportant as Id thought Not so bad at allreally And just as Ive come to this conclusion a parachute lands next to us with a fresh loaf of bread Remembering from last year how Haymitchs gifts are often timed to send a message I make a note to myself Be friends with Finnick Youll get food Finnick turns the bread over in his hands examining the crust A bit too possessively Its not necessary Its got that green tint from seaweed that the bread from District  always has We all know its his Maybe hes just realized how precious it is and that he may never see another loaf again Maybe some memory of Mags isassociated with the crust But all he says is This will go well with the shellfish While I help Peeta coat his skin with the ointment Finnick deftly cleans the meat from the shellfish We gather round and eat the delicious sweet flesh with the salty bread from District  We all look monstrousthe ointment seems to be causing some of the scabs to peel  but Im glad for the medicine Not just because it gives relief from the itching but also because it acts as protection from that blazing white sun in the pink sky By its position I estimate it must be going on ten oclock that weve been in the arena for about a day Eleven of us are dead Thirteen alive Somewhere in the jungle ten are concealed Three or four are the Careers I dont really feel like trying to remember who the others are For me the jungle has quickly evolved from a place of protection to a sinister trap I know at some point well be forced to reenterits depths either to hunt or be hunted but for right now Im planning to stick to our little beach And I dont hear Peeta or Finnick suggesting we do otherwise For a while the jungle seems almost static humming shimmering but not flaunting its dangers Then in the distance comes screaming Across from us a wedge of the jungle begins to vibrate An enormous wave crests high on the hill topping the trees and roaring down the slope It hits the existing seawater with such force that even though were as far as we can get from it the surf bubbles up around our knees setting our few possessions afloat Among the three of us we manage to collect everything before its carried off except for our chemicalriddled jumpsuits which are so eaten away no one cares if we lose them A cannon fires We see the hovercraft appear over the area where the wave began and pluck a body from the trees Twelve I think The circle ofwater slowly calms down having absorbed the giant wave We rearrange our things back on the wet sand and are about to settle down when I see them Three figures about two spokes away stumbling onto the beach There I say quietly nodding in the newcomers direction Peeta and Finnick follow my gaze As if by previous agreement we all fade back into the shadows of the jungle The trios in bad shapeyou can see that right off One is being practically dragged out by a second and the thirdwanders in loopy circles as if deranged Theyre a solid brickred color as if theyve been dipped in paint and left out to dry Who is that asks Peeta Or what Muttations I draw back an arrow readying for an attack But all that happens is that the one who was being dragged collapses on the beach The dragger stamps the ground in frustration andin an apparent fit of temper turns and shoves the circling deranged one over Finnicks face lights up Johanna he calls and runs for the red things Finnick I hear Johannas voice reply I exchange a look with Peeta What now I ask We cant really leave Finnick he says Guess not Come on then I say grouchily because even if Id had a list of allies Johanna Mason would definitely not have been on it The two of us tromp down the beach to where Finnick and Johanna are just meeting up As we move in closer I see her companions and confusion sets in Thats Beetee on the ground on his back and Wiress whos regained her feet to continue making loops Shes got Wiress and Beetee Nuts and Volts says Peeta equally puzzled Ive got to hear how this happened When we reach them Johannas gesturing toward the jungle and talking very fast to Finnick We thought it was rain you know because of thelightning and we were all so thirsty But when it started coming down it turned out to be blood Thick hot blood You couldnt see you couldnt speak without getting a mouthful We just staggered around trying to get out of it Thats when Blight hit the force field Im sorry Johanna says Finnick It takes a moment to place Blight I think he was Johannas male counterpart from District  but I hardly remember seeing him Come to think of it I dont even think he showed up for training Yeah well he wasnt much but he was from home she says And he left me alone with these two She nudges Beetee whos barely conscious with her shoe He got a knife in the back at the Cornucopia And her We all look over at Wiress whos circling around coated in dried blood and murmuring Tick tock Tick tock Yeah we know Tick tock Nuts is in shock says Johanna This seems to draw Wiress in her direction and shecareens into Johanna who harshly shoves her to the beach Just stay down will you Lay off her I snap Johanna narrows her brown eyes at me in hatred Lay off her she hisses She steps forward before I can react and slaps me so hard I see stars Who do you think got them out of that bleeding jungle for you You Finnick tosses her writhing body over his shoulder and carries her out into the water and repeatedly dunks her while she screams a lot of really insulting things at me But I dont shoot Because shes with Finnick and because of what she said about getting them for me What did she mean She got them for me I ask Peeta I dont know You did want them originally hereminds me Yeah I did Originally But that answers nothing I look down at Beetees inert body But I wont have them long unless we do something Peeta lifts Beetee up inhis arms and I take Wiress by the hand and we go back to our little beach camp I sit Wiress in the shallows so she can get washed up a bit but she just clutches her hands together and occasionally mumbles Tick tock I unhook Beetees belt and find a heavy metal cylinder attached to the side with a rope of vines I cant tell what it is but if he thought it was worth saving Im not going to be the one who loses it I toss it up on the sand Beetees clothes are glued to him with blood so Peeta holds him in the water while I loosen them It takes some time to get the jumpsuit off and then we find his undergarments are saturated with blood as well Theres no choice but to strip him naked to get him clean but I have to say this doesnt make much of an impression on me anymore Our kitchen tables been full of so many naked men this year You kind of get used to it after a while We put down Finnicks mat and lay Beetee on hisstomach so we can examine his back Theres a gash about six inches long running from his shoulder blade to below his ribs Fortunately its not too deep Hes lost a lot of blood thoughyou can tell by the pallor of his skin  and its still oozing out of the wound I sit back on my heels trying to think What do I have to work with Seawater I feel like my mother when her first line of defense for treating everything was snow I look over at the jungle I bet theres a whole pharmacy in there if I knew how to use it But these arent my plants Then I think about the moss Mags gave me to blow my nose Be right back I tell Peeta Fortunately the stuff seems to be pretty common in the jungle I rip an armful from the nearby trees and carry it back to the beach I make a thick pad out of the moss place it on Beetees cut and secure it by tying vines around his body We get some water into him and then pull him into the shade at the edge of thejungle I think thats all we can do I say Its good Youre good with this healing stuff he says Its in your blood No I say shaking my head I got my fathers blood The kind that quickens during a hunt not an epidemic Im going to see about Wiress I take a handful of the moss to use as a rag and join Wiress in the shallows She doesnt resist as I work off her clothing scrub the blood from her skin But her eyes are dilated with fear and when I speak she doesnt respond except to say with everincreasing urgency Tick tock She does seem to be trying to tell me something but with no Beetee to explain her thoughts Im at a loss Yes tick tock Tick tock I say This seems to calm her down a little I wash out her jumpsuit until theres hardly a trace of blood and help her back into it Its not damaged like ours were Herbelts fine so I fasten that on too Then I pin her undergarments along with Beetees under some rocks and let them soak By the time Ive rinsed out Beetees jumpsuit a shiny clean Johanna and peeling Finnick have joined us For a while Johanna gulps water and stuffs herself with shellfish while I try to coax something into Wiress Finnick tells about the fog and the monkeys in a detached almost clinical voice avoiding the most important detail of the story Everybody offers to guard while the others rest but in the end its Johanna and I who stay up Me because Im really rested she because she simply refuses to lie down The two of us sit in silence on the beach until the others have gone to sleep Johanna glances over at Finnick to be sure then turns to me Howd you lose Mags In the fog Finnick had Peeta I had Mags for a while Then I couldnt lift her Finnick said he couldnt take them both She kissed him and walked rightinto the poison I say She was Finnicks mentor you know Johanna says accusingly No I didnt I say She was half his family she says a few moments later but theres less venom behind it We watch the water lap up over the undergarments So what were you doing with Nuts and Volts I ask I told you  I got them for you Haymitch said if we were to be allies I had to bring them to you says Johanna Thats what you told him right No I think But I nod my head in assent Thanks I appreciate it I hope so She gives me a look filled with loathing like Im the biggest drag possible on her life I wonder if this is what its like to have an older sister who really hates you Tick tock I hear behind me I turn and see Wiress has crawled over Her eyes are focused on the jungle Oh goody shes back Okay Im going to sleep You and Nuts can guard together Johanna says She goes over and flings herself down beside FinnickTick tock whispers Wiress I guide her in front of me and get her to lie down stroking her arm to soothe her She drifts off stirring restlessly occasionally sighing out her phrase Tick tock Tick tock I agree softly Its time for bed Tick tock Go to sleep The sun rises in the sky until its directly over us It must be noon I think absently Not that it matters Across the water off to the right I see the enormous flash as the lightning bolt hits the tree and the electrical storm begins again Right in the same area it did last night Someone must have moved into its range triggered the attack I sit for a while watching the lightning keeping Wiress calm lulled into a sort of peacefulness by the lapping of the water I think of last night how the lightning began just after the bell tolled Twelve bongs Tick tock Wiress says surfacing to consciousness for a moment and then going back under Twelve bongs last night Like it wasmidnight Then lightning The sunoverhead now Like its noon And lightning Slowly I rise up and survey the arena The lightning there In the next pie wedge over came the blood rain where Johanna Wiress and Beetee were caught We would have been in the third section right next to that when the fog appeared And as soon as it was sucked away the monkeys began to gather in the fourth Tick tock My head snaps to the other side A couple of hours ago at around ten that wave came out of the second section to the left of where the lightning strikes now Atnoon At midnight At noon Tick tock Wiress says in her sleep As the lightning ceases and the blood rain begins just to the right of it her words suddenly make sense Oh Isay under my breath Tick tock My eyes sweep around the full circle of the arena and I know shes right Tick tock This is a clock A clock I can almost see the hands ticking around the twelvesectioned face of the arena Each hour begins a new horror a new Gamemaker weapon and ends the previous Lightning blood rain fog monkeys  those are the first four hours on the clock And at ten the wave I dont know what happens in the other seven but I know Wiress is right At present the blood rains falling and were on the beach below the monkey segment far too close to the fog for my liking Do the various attacks stay within the confines of the jungle Not necessarily The wave didnt If that fog leaches out of the jungle or the monkeys return  Get up I order shaking Peeta and Finnick and Johanna awake Get upwe have to move Theres enough time though to explain the clock theory to them About Wiresssticktocking and how the movements of the invisible hands trigger a deadly force in each section I think Ive convinced everyone whos conscious except Johanna whos naturally opposed to liking anything I suggest But even she agrees its better to be safe than sorry While the others collect our few possessions and get Beetee back into his jumpsuit I rouse Wiress She awakes with a panicked tick tock Yes tick tock the arenas a clock Its a clock Wiress you were right I say You were right Relief floods her face  I guess because somebody has finally understood what shes known probably from the first tolling of the bells Midnight It starts at midnight I confirm A memory struggles to surface in my brain I see a clock No its a watch resting in Plutarch Heavensbees palm It starts at midnight Plutarch said And then my mockingjay lit up briefly and vanished In retrospect its like he was giving mea clue about the arena But why would he At the time I was no more a tribute in these Games than he was Maybe he thought it would help me as a mentor Or maybe this had been the plan all along Wiress nods at the blood rain Onethirty she says Exactly Onethirty And at two a terrible poisonous fog begins there I say pointing at the nearby jungle So we have to move somewhere safe now She smiles and stands up obediently Are you thirsty I hand her the woven bowl and she gulps down about a quart Finnick gives her the last bit of bread and she gnaws on it With the inability to communicate overcome shes functioning again I check my weapons Tie up the spile and the tube of medicine in the parachute and fix it to my belt with vine Beetees still pretty out of it but when Peeta tries to lift him he objects Wire he says Shes righthere Peeta tells him Wiress is fine Shes coming too But still Beetee struggles Wire he insists Oh I know what he wants says Johanna impatiently She crosses the beach and picks up the cylinder we took from his belt when we were bathing him Its coated in a thick layer of congealed blood This worthless thing Its some kind of wire or something Thats how he got cut Running up to the Cornucopia to get this I dont know what kind of weapon its supposed to be I guess you could pull off a piece and use it as a garrote or something But really can you imagine Beetee garroting somebody He won his Games with wire Setting up that electrical trap says Peeta Its the best weapon he could have Theres something odd about Johanna not putting this together Something that doesnt quite ring true Suspicious Seems like youd have figured that out I say Since you nicknamed him Volts and allJohannas eyes narrow at me dangerously Yeah that was really stupid of me wasnt it she says I guess I must have been distracted by keeping your little friends alive While you werewhat again Getting Mags killed off My fingers tighten on the knife handle at my belt Go ahead Try it I dont care if you are knocked up Ill rip your throat out says Johanna I know I cant kill her right now But its just a matter of time with Johanna and me Before one of us offs the other Maybe we all had better be careful where we step says Finnick shooting me a look He takes the coil and sets it on Beetees chest Theres your wire Volts Watch where you plug it Peeta picks up the nowunresisting Beetee Where to Id like to go to the Cornucopia and watch Just to make sure were right about the clock says Finnick It seems as good a plan as any Besides I wouldnt mind the chance of going over the weapons again And there are six ofus now Even if you count Beetee and Wiress out weve got four good fighters Its so different from where I was last year at this point doing everything on my own Yes its great to have allies as long as you can ignore the thought that youll have to kill them Beetee and Wiress will probably find some way to die on their own If we have to run from something how far would they get Johanna frankly I could easily kill if it came down to protecting Peeta Or maybe even just to shut her up What I really need is for someone to take out Finnick for me since I dont think I can do it personally Not after all hes done for Peeta I think about maneuvering him into some kind of encounter with the Careers Its cold I know But what are my options Now that we know about the clock he probably wont die in the jungle so someones going to have to kill him in battle Because this is so repellent to think about my mindfrantically tries to change topics But the only thing that distracts me from my current situation is fantasizingabout killing President Snow Not very pretty daydreams for a seventeenyearold girl I guess but very satisfying We walk down the nearest sand strip approaching the Cornucopia with care just in case the Careers are concealed there I doubt they are because weve been on the beach for hours and theres been no sign of life The areas abandoned as I expected Only the big golden horn and the pickedover pile of weapons remain When Peeta lays Beetee in the bit of shade the Cornucopia provides he calls out to Wiress She crouches beside him and he puts the coil of wire in her hands Clean it will you he asks Wiress nods and scampers over to the waters edge where she dunks the coil in the water She starts quietly singing some funny littlesong about a mouse running up a clock It must be for children but it seems to make her happy Oh not the song again says Johanna rolling her eyes That went on for hours before she started ticktocking Suddenly Wiress stands up very straight and points to the jungle Two she says I follow her finger to where the wall of fog has just begun to seep out onto the beach Yes look Wiress is right Its two oclock and the fog has started Like clockwork says Peeta You were very smart to figure that out Wiress Wiress smiles and goes back to singing and dunking her coil Oh shes more than smart says Beetee Shes intuitive We all turn to look at Beetee who seems to be coming back to life She can sense things before anyone else Like a canary in one of your coal mines Whats that Finnick asks me Its a bird that we take down into the mines to warn us if theres bad air I say Whats it do die asks Johanna Itstops singing first Thats when you should get out But if the airs too bad it dies yes And so do you I dont want to talk about dying songbirds They bring up thoughts of my fathers death and Rues death and Maysilee Donners death and my mother inheriting her songbird Oh great and now Im thinking of Gale deep down in that horrible mine with President Snows threat hanging over his head So easy to make it look like an accident down there A silent canary a spark and nothing more I go back to imagining killing the president Despite her annoyance at Wiress Johannas as happy as Ive seen her in the arena While Im adding to my stock of arrows she pokes around until she comes up with a pair of lethallooking axes It seems an odd choice until I see her throw one with such force it sticks in the sunsoftened gold of the Cornucopia Of course Johanna Mason District  Lumber I bet shes been tossing around axes since shecould toddle Its like Finnick with his trident Or Beetee with his wire Rue with her knowledge of plants I realize its just another disadvantage the District  tributes have faced over the years We dont go down in the mines until were eighteen It looks likemost of the other tributes learn something about their trades early on There are things you do in a mine that could come in handy in the Games Wielding a pick Blowing things up Give you an edge The way my hunting did But we learn them too late While Ive been messing with the weapons Peetas been squatting on the ground drawing something with the tip of his knife on a large smooth leaf he brought from the jungle I look over his shoulder and see hes creating a map of the arena In the center is the Cornucopia on its circle of sand with the twelve strips branching outfrom it It looks like a pie sliced into twelve equal wedges Theres another circle representing the waterline and a slightly larger one indicating the edge of the jungle Look how the Cornucopias positioned he says to me I examine the Cornucopia and see what he means The tail points toward twelve oclock I say Right so this is the top of our clock he says and quickly scratches the numbers one through twelve around the clock face Twelve to one is the lightning zone He writes lightning in tiny print in the corresponding wedge then works clockwise adding blood fog and monkeys in the following sections And ten to eleven is the wave I say He adds it Finnick and Johanna join us at this point armed to the teeth with tridents axes and knives Did you notice anything unusual in the others I ask Johanna and Beetee since they might have seen something we didnt But all theyve seen is a lot of blood Iguess they could hold anything Im going to mark the ones where we know the Gamemakers weapon follows us out past the jungle so well stay clear of those says Peeta drawing diagonal lines on the fog and wave beaches Then he sits back Well its a lot more than we knew this morning anyway We all nod in agreement and thats when I notice it The silence Our canary has stopped singing I dont wait I load an arrow as I twist and get a glimpse of a drippingwet Gloss letting Wiress slide to the ground her throat slit open in a bright red smile The point of my arrow disappears into his right temple and in the instant it takes to reload Johanna has buried an ax blade in Cashmeres chest Finnick knocks away a spear Brutus throws at Peeta and takes Enobarias knife in his thigh If there wasnt a Cornucopia to duck behind theyd be dead both of the tributes from District  I spring forward in pursuit Boom Boom BoomThe cannon confirms theres no way to help Wiress no need to finish off Gloss or Cashmere My allies and I are rounding the horn starting to give chase to Brutus and Enobaria who are sprinting down a sand strip toward the jungle Suddenly the ground jerks beneath my feet and Im flung on my side in the sand The circle of land that holds the Cornucopia starts spinning fast really fast and I can see the jungle going by in a blur I feel the centrifugal force pulling me toward thewater and dig my hands and feet into the sand trying to get some purchase on the unstable ground Between the flying sand and the dizziness I have to squeeze my eyes shut There is literally nothing I can do but hold on until with no deceleration we slam to a stop Coughing and queasy I sit up slowly to find my companions in the same condition Finnick Johanna and Peeta have hung on Thethree dead bodies have been tossed out into the seawaterThe whole thing from missing Wiresss song to now cant have taken more than a minute or two We sit there panting scraping the sand out of our mouths Wheres Volts says Johanna Were on our feet One wobbly circle of the Cornucopia confirms hes gone Finnick spots him about twenty yards out in the water barely keeping afloat and swims out to haul him in Thats when I remember the wire and how important it was to him I look frantically around Where is it Where is it And then I see it still clutched in Wiresss hands far out in the water My stomach contracts at the thought of what I must do next Cover me I say to the others I toss aside my weapons and race down the strip closest to her body Without slowing down I dive into the water and start for her Out of the corner of my eye I can seethe hovercraft appearing over us the claw starting to descend to take her away But I dont stop I just keep swimming as hard as I can and end up slamming into her body I come up gasping trying to avoid swallowing the bloodstained water that spreads out from the open wound in her neck Shes floating on her back borne up by her belt and death staring into that relentless sun As I tread water I have to wrench the coil of wire from her fingers because her final grip on it is so tight Theres nothing I can do then but close her eyelids whisper goodbye and swim away By the time I swing the coil up onto the sand and pull myself from the water her bodys gone But I can still taste her blood mingled with the sea salt I walk back to the Cornucopia Finnicks gotten Beetee back alive although a little waterlogged sitting up and snorting out water He had the good sense to hang on to his glasses so at least he can see Iplace the reel of wire on his lap Its sparkling clean no blood left at all He unravels a piece of the wire and runs it through his fingers For the first time I see it and its unlike any wire I know A pale golden color and as fine as a piece of hair I wonder how long it is There must be miles of the stuff to fill the large spool But I dont ask because I know hes thinking of Wiress I look at the others sober faces Now Finnick Johanna and Beetee have all lost their district partners I cross to Peeta and wrap my arms around him and for a while we all stay silent Lets get off this stinking island Johanna says finally Theres only the matter of our weapons now which weve largely retained Fortunately the vines here are strong and the spile and tube of medicine wrapped in the parachute are still secured to my belt Finnick strips off his undershirt and ties it around the wound Enobarias knife made in his thigh its not deep Beetee thinkshe can walk now if we go slowly so I help him up We decide to head to the beach at twelve oclock That should provide hours of calm and keep us clear of any poisonous residue And then Peeta Johanna and Finnick head off inthree different directions Twelve oclock right says Peeta The tail points at twelve Before they spun us says Finnick I was judging by the sun The sun only tells you its going on four Finnick I say I think Katnisss point is knowing the time doesnt mean you necessarily know where four is on the clock You might have a general idea of the direction Unless you consider that they may have shifted the outer ring of jungle as well says Beetee No Katnisss point was a lot more basic than that Beetees articulated a theory far beyond my comment on the sun But I just nod my head like Ive been on the same page all along Yes soany one of these paths could lead to twelve oclock I say We circle around the Cornucopia scrutinizing the jungle It has a baffling uniformity I remember the tall tree that took the first lightning strike at twelve oclock but every sector has a similar tree Johanna thinks to follow Enobarias and Brutuss tracks but they have been blown or washed away Theres no way to tell where anything is I should have never mentioned the clock I say bitterly Now theyve taken that advantage away as well Only temporarily says Beetee At ten well see the wave again and be back on track Yes they cant redesign the whole arena says Peeta It doesnt matter says Johanna impatiently You had to tell us or we never would have moved our camp in the first place brainless Ironically her logical if demeaning reply is the only one that comforts me Yes I had to tell them to get them to move Come on I needwater Anyone have a good gut feeling We randomly choose a path and take it having no idea what number were headed for When we reach the jungle we peer into it trying to decipher what may be waiting inside Well it must be monkey hour And I dont see any of them in there says Peeta Im going to try to tap a tree No its my turn says Finnick Ill at least watch your back Peeta says Katniss can do that says Johanna We need you to make another map The other washed away She yanks a large leaf off a tree and hands it to him For a moment Im suspicious theyre trying to divide and kill us But it doesnt make sense Ill have the advantage on Finnick if hes dealing with the tree and Peetas much bigger than Johanna So I follow Finnick about fifteen yards into the jungle where he finds a good tree and starts stabbing to make a hole with his knife As I stand there weapons ready I cant lose the uneasy feelingthat something is going on and that it has to do with Peeta I retrace our steps starting from the moment the gong rang out searching for the source of my discomfort Finnick towing Peeta in off his metal plate Finnick reviving Peeta after the force field stopped his heart Mags running into the fog so that Finnick could carry Peeta The morphling hurling herself in front of him to block themonkeys attack The fight with the Careers was so quick but didnt Finnick block Brutuss spear from hitting Peeta even though it meant taking Enobarias knife in his leg And even now Johanna has him drawing a map on a leaf rather than risking the jungle There is no question about it For reasons completely unfathomable to me some of the other victors are trying to keep him alive even if it means sacrificing themselves Im dumbfounded For one thingthats my job For another it doesnt make sense Only one of us can get out So why have they chosen Peeta to protect What has Haymitch possibly said to them what has he bargained with to make them put Peetas life above their own I know my own reasons for keeping Peeta alive Hes my friend and this is my way to defy the Capitol to subvert its terrible Games But if I had no real ties to him what would make me want to save him to choose him over myself Certainly he is brave but we have all been brave enough to survive a Games There is that quality of goodness thats hard to overlook but still  and then I think of it what Peeta can do so much better than the rest of us He can use words He obliterated the rest of the field at both interviews And maybe its because of that underlying goodness that he can move a crowdno a countryto his side with the turn of a simple sentence I remember thinking that was the gift theleader of our revolution should have Has Haymitch convinced the others of this That Peetas tongue would have far greater power against the Capitol than any physical strength the rest of us could claim I dont know It still seems like a really long leap for some of the tributes I mean were talking about Johanna Mason here But what other explanation can there be for their decided efforts to keep him alive Katniss got that spile Finnick asks snapping me back to reality I cut the vine that ties the spile to my belt and hold the metal tube out to him Thats when I hear the scream So full of fear and pain it ices my blood And so familiar I drop the spile forget where I am or what lies ahead only know I must reach her protect her I run wildly in the direction of the voice heedless of danger ripping through vines and branches through anything that keeps me from reaching her From reaching my little sister Where isshe What are they doing to her Prim I cry out Prim Only another agonized scream answers me How did she get here Why is she part of the Games Prim Vines cut into my face and arms creepers grab my feet But I am getting closer to her Closer Very close now Sweat pours down my face stinging the healing acid wounds I pant trying to get some use out of the warm moist air that seems empty of oxygen Prim makes a sound  such a lost irretrievable soundthat I cant even imagine what they have done to evoke it Prim I rip through a wall of green into a small clearing and thesound repeats directly above me Above me My head whips back Do they have her up in the trees I desperately search the branches but see nothing Prim I say pleadingly I hear her but cant see her Her next wail ringsout clear as a bell and theres no mistaking the source Its coming from the mouth of a small crested black bird perched on a branch about ten feet over my head And then I understand Its a jabberjay Ive never seen one before  I thought they no longer existedand for a moment as I lean against the trunk of the tree clutching the stitch in my side I examine it The muttation the forerunner the father I pull up a mental image of a mockingbird fuse it with the jabberjay and yes I can see how they mated to make my mockingjay There is nothing about the bird that suggests its a mutt Nothing except the horribly lifelike sounds of Prims voice streaming from its mouth I silence it with an arrow in its throat The bird falls to the ground I remove my arrow and wring its neck for good measure Then I hurl the revolting thing into the jungle No degree of hunger would ever tempt me to eat it It wasnt real I tell myself The sameway the muttation wolves last year werent really the dead tributes Its just a sadistic trick of the Gamemakers Finnick crashes into the clearing to find me wiping my arrow clean with some moss Katniss Its okay Im okay I say although I dont feel okay at all I thought I heard my sister but The piercing shriek cuts me off Its another voice not Prims maybe a young womans I dont recognize it But the effect on Finnick is instantaneous The color vanishes from his face and I can actually see his pupils dilate in fear Finnick wait I say reaching out to reassure him but hes bolted away Gone off in pursuit of the victim as mindlessly as I pursued Prim Finnick I call but I know he wont turn back and wait for me to give a rational explanation So all I can do is follow him Its no effort to track him even though hes moving so fast since he leaves a clear trampled path in his wake But the bird is at least a quarter mile away most ofit uphill and by the time I reach him Im winded Hes circling around a giant tree The trunk must be four feet in diameter and the limbs dont even begin until twenty feet up The womans shrieks emanate from somewhere in the foliage but the jabberjays concealed Finnicks screaming as well over and over Annie Annie Hes in a state of panic and completely unreachable so I do what I would do anyway I scale an adjacent tree locate the jabberjay and take it out with an arrow It falls straight down landing right at Finnicks feet He picks it up slowly making the connection but when I slide down to join him he looks more despairing than ever Its all right Finnick Its just a jabberjay Theyre playing a trick on us I say Its not real Its not your  Annie Noits not Annie But the voice was hers Jabberjaysmimic what they hear Where did they get those screams Katniss he says I can feel my own cheeks grow pale as I understand his meaning Oh Finnick you dont think they  Yes I do Thats exactly what I think he says I have an image of Prim in a white room strapped to a table while masked robed figures elicit those sounds from her Somewhere they are torturing her or did torture her to get those sounds My knees turn to water and I sink to the ground Finnick is trying to tell me something but I cant hear him What I do finally hear is another bird starting up somewhere off to my left And this time the voice is Gales Finnick catches my arm before I can run No Its not him He starts pulling me downhill toward the beach Were getting out of here But Gales voice is so full of pain I cant help struggling to reach it Its not him Katniss Its a mutt Finnick shouts at me Come on He moves me along halfdragging half carrying me until I can process what he said Hes right its just another jabberjay I cant help Gale by chasing it down But that doesnt change the fact that it is Gales voice and somewhere sometime someone has made him sound like this I stop fighting Finnick though and like the night in the fog I flee what I cant fight What can only do me harm Only this time its my heart and not my body thatsdisintegrating This must be another weapon of the clock Four oclock I guess When the hands ticktock onto the four the monkeys go home and the jabberjays come out to play Finnick is rightgetting out of here is the only thing to do Although there will be nothing Haymitch can send in a parachute that will help either Finnick or me recover from the wounds the birds have inflicted I catch sight of Peeta and Johanna standing at the tree line and Im filled with amixture of relief and anger Why didnt Peeta come to help me Why did no one come after us Even now he hangs back his hands raised palms toward us lips moving but no words reaching us Why The wall is so transparent Finnick and I run smack into it and bounce back onto the jungle floor Im lucky My shoulder took the worst of the impact whereas Finnick hit facefirst and now his nose is gushing blood This is why Peeta and Johanna and even Beetee who I see sadly shaking his head behind them have not come to our aid An invisible barrier blocks the area in front of us Its not a force field You can touch the hard smooth surface all you like But Peetas knife and Johannas ax cant make a dent in it I know without checking more than a few feet to one side that it encloses the entire fourtofiveoclock wedge That we will be trapped like rats until the hour passes Peeta presses his hand against the surface and I put my own up tomeet it as if I can feel him through the wall I see his lips moving but I cant hear him cant hear anything outside our wedge I try to make out what hes saying but I cant focus so I just stare at his face doing my best to hang on to my sanity Then the birds begin to arrive One by one Perching in the surrounding branches And a carefully orchestrated chorus of horror begins to spill out of their mouths Finnick gives up at once hunching on the ground clenching his hands over his ears as if hes trying to crush his skull I try to fight for a while Emptying my quiver of arrows into the hated birds But every time one drops dead another quickly takes its place And finally I give up and curl up beside Finnick trying to block out the excruciating sounds of Prim Gale my mother Madge Rory Vick even Posy helpless little Posy I know its stopped when I feel Peetas hands on me feel myself lifted from the ground and out ofthe jungle But I stay eyes squeezed shut hands over my ears muscles too rigid to release Peeta holds me on his lap speaking soothing words rocking me gently It takes a long time before I begin to relax the iron grip on my body And when I do the trembling begins Its all right Katniss he whispers You didnt hear them I answer I heard Prim Right in the beginning But it wasnt her he says It was a jabberjay It was her Somewhere The jabberjay just recorded it I say No thats what they want you to think The same way I wondered if Glimmerseyes were in that mutt last year But those werent Glimmers eyes And that wasnt Prims voice Or if it was they took it from an interview or something and distorted the sound Made it say whatever she was saying he says No they were torturing her I answer Shes probablydead Katniss Prim isnt dead How could they kill Prim Were almost down to the final eight of us And what happens then Peeta says Seven more of us die I say hopelessly No back home What happens when they reach the final eight tributes in the Games He lifts my chin so I have to look at him Forces me to make eye contact What happens At the final eight I know hes trying to help me so I make myself think At the final eight I repeat They interview your family and friends back home Thats right says Peeta They interview your family and friends And can they do that if theyve killed them all No I ask still unsure No Thats how we know Prims alive Shell be the first one they interview wont she he asks I want to believe him Badly Its just  those voices  First Prim Then your mother Your cousin Gale Madge he continues It was a trick Katniss A horrible one But were the only ones whocan be hurt by it Were the ones in the Games Not them You really believe that I say I really do says Peeta I waver thinking of how Peeta can make anyone believe anything I look over at Finnick for confirmation see hes fixated on Peeta his words Do you believe it Finnick I ask It could be true I dont know he says Could they do that Beetee Take someones regular voice and make it  Oh yes Its not even that difficult Finnick Our children learn a similar technique in school says Beetee Of course Peetas right The whole country adores Katnisss little sister If they really killed her like this theyd probably have an uprising on their hands says Johanna flatly Dont want that do they She throws back her head and shouts Whole country in rebellion Wouldnt want anything like that My mouth drops open in shock No one ever says anything like this in the Games Absolutely theyve cut away fromJohanna are editing her out But I have heard her and can never think about her again in the same way Shell never win any awards for kindness but she certainly is gutsy Or crazy She picks up some shells and heads toward the jungle Im getting water she says I cant help catching her hand as she passes me Dont go in there The birds I remember the birds must be gone but I still dont want anyone in there Not even her They cant hurt me Im not like the rest of you Theres no one left I love Johanna says and frees her hand with an impatient shake When she brings me back a shell of water I take it with a silent nod of thanks knowing how much she would despise the pity in my voice While Johannacollects water and my arrows Beetee fiddles with his wire and Finnick takes to the water I need to clean up toobut I stay in Peetas arms still too shaken to move Who did they use against Finnick he asks Somebody named Annie I say Must be Annie Cresta he says Who I ask Annie Cresta She was the girl Mags volunteered for She won about five years ago says Peeta That would have been the summer after my father died when I first began feeding my family when my whole being was occupied with battling starvation I dont remember those Games much I say Was that the earthquake year Yeah Annies the one who went mad when her district partner got beheaded Ran off by herself and hid But an earthquake broke a dam and most of the arena got flooded She won because she was the best swimmer says Peeta Did she get better after I ask I mean her mind I dont know I dont remember ever seeing her at the Games again But she didnt look too stable during the reaping this year says Peeta So thats whoFinnick loves I think Not his string of fancy lovers in the Capitol But a poor mad girl back home A cannon blast brings us all together on the beach A hovercraft appears in what we estimate to be the sixtosevenoclock zone We watch as the claw dips down five different times to retrieve the pieces of one body torn apart Its impossible to tell who it was Whatever happens at six oclock I never want to know Peeta draws a new map on a leaf adding a JJ for jabberjays in the fourtofiveoclock section and simply writing beast in the one where we saw the tribute collected in pieces We now have a good idea of what seven of the hours will bring And if theres any positive to the jabberjay attack its that it let us know where we are on the clock face again Finnick weaves yet another water basket and a net for fishing I take a quick swim and put more ointment on my skin Then I sit at the edge of the water cleaning the fishFinnick catches and watching the sun drop below the horizon The bright moon is already on the rise filling the arena with that strange twilight Were about to settle down to our meal of raw fish when the anthem begins And then the faces  Cashmere Gloss Wiress Mags The woman from District  The morphling who gave her life for Peeta Blight The man from  Eight dead Plus eight from the first night Twothirds of us gone in a day and a half That must be some kind of record Theyre really burning through us says Johanna Whos left Besides us five and District Two asks Finnick Chaff says Peeta without needing to think about it Perhaps hes been keeping an eye out for him because of Haymitch A parachute comes down with a pile of bitesized squareshaped rolls These are from your district right Beetee Peeta asks Yes from District Three he says How many are there Finnick countsthem turning each one over in his hands before he sets it in a neat configuration I dont know what it is with Finnick and bread but he seems obsessed with handling it Twentyfour he says An even two dozen then says Beetee Twentyfour on the nose says Finnick How should we divide them Lets each have three and whoever is still alive at breakfast can take a vote on the rest says Johanna I dont know why this makes me laugh a little I guess because its true When I do Johanna gives me a look thats almost approving No not approving But maybe slightly pleased We wait until the giant wave has flooded out of the tentoelevenoclock section wait for the water to recede and then go to that beach to make camp Theoretically we should have a full twelve hours of safety from the jungle Theres an unpleasant chorus of clicking probably from some evil type of insect coming from theeleventotwelveoclock wedge But whatever is making the sound stays within the confines of the jungle and we keep off that part of the beach in case theyre just waiting for a carelessly placed footfall to swarm out I dont know how Johannas still on her feet Shes only had about an hour of sleep since the Games started Peeta and I volunteer for the first watch because were better rested and because we want some time alone The others go out immediately although Finnicks sleep is restless Every now and then I hear him murmuring Annies name Peeta and I sit on the damp sand facing away from each other my right shoulder and hip pressed against his I watch the water as he watches the jungle which is better for me Im still haunted by the voices of the jabberjays which unfortunately the insects cant drown out After a while I rest my head against his shoulder Feel his hand caress my hair Katniss he sayssoftly its no use pretending we dont know what the other one is trying to do No I guess there isnt but its no fun discussing it either Well not for us anyway The Capitol viewers will be glued to their sets so they dont miss one wretched word I dont know what kind of deal you think youve made with Haymitch but you should know he made me promises as well Of course I know this too He told Peeta they could keep me alive so that he wouldnt be suspicious So I think we can assume he was lying to one of us This gets my attention A double deal A double promise With only Haymitch knowing which one is real I raise my head meet Peetas eyes Why are you saying this nowBecause I dont want you forgetting how different our circumstances are If you die and I live theres no life for me at all back in District Twelve Youre my whole life hesays I would never be happy again I start to object but he puts a finger to my lips Its different for you Im not saying it wouldnt be hard But there are other people whod make your life worth living Peeta pulls the chain with the gold disk from around his neck He holds it in the moonlight so I can clearly see the mockingjay Then his thumb slides along a catch I didnt notice before and the disk pops open Its not solid as I had thought but a locket And within the locket are photos On the right side my mother and Prim laughing And on the left Gale Actually smiling There is nothing in the world that could break me faster at this moment than these three faces After what I heard this afternoon  it is the perfect weapon Your family needs you Katniss Peeta says My family My mother My sister And my pretend cousin Gale But Peetas intention is clear That Gale really is my family or will be one day if I liveThat Ill marry him So Peetas giving me his life and Gale at the same time To let me know I shouldnt ever have doubts about it Everything Thats what Peeta wants me to take from him I wait for him to mention the baby to play to the cameras but he doesnt And thats how I know that none of this is part of the Games That he is telling me the truth about what he feels No one really needs me he says and theres no selfpity in his voice Its true his family doesnt need him They will mourn him as will a handful of friends But they will get on Even Haymitch with the help of a lot of white liquor will get on I realize only one person will be damaged beyond repair if Peeta dies Me I do I say I need you He looks upset takes a deep breath as if to begin a long argument and thats no good no good at all because hell start going on about Prim and my mother and everything and Ill just get confused So before he can talk Istop his lips with a kiss I feel that thing again The thing I only felt once before In the cave last year when I was trying to get Haymitch to send us food I kissed Peeta about a thousand times during those Games and after But there was only one kiss that made me feel something stir deep inside Only one that made me want more But my head wound started bleeding and he made me lie down This time there is nothing but us to interrupt us And after a few attempts Peeta gives up on talking The sensation inside me grows warmer and spreads out from my chest down through my body out along my arms and legs to the tips of my being Instead of satisfying me the kisses have the opposite effect of making my need greater I thought I was something of an expert on hunger but this is an entirely new kind Its the first crack of the lightningstormthe bolt hitting the tree at midnightthat brings us to our senses It rouses Finnick as well He sits up with a sharp cry I see his fingers digging into the sand as he reassures himself that whatever nightmare he inhabited wasnt real I cant sleep anymore he says One of you should rest Only then does he seem to notice our expressions the way were wrapped around each other Or both of you I can watch alone Peeta wont let him though Its too dangerous he says Im not tired You lie down Katniss I dont object because I do need to sleep if Im to be of any use keeping him alive I let him lead me over to where the others are He puts the chain with the locket around my neck then rests his hand over the spot where our baby would be Youre going to make a great mother you know he says He kisses me one last time and goes back to Finnick His reference to the baby signals that our timeout from theGames is over That he knows the audience will be wondering why he hasnt used the most persuasive argument in his arsenal That sponsors must be manipulated But as I stretch out on the sand I wonder could it be more Like a reminder to me that I could still one day have kids with Gale Well if that was it it was a mistake Because for one thing thats never been part of my plan And for another if only one of us can be a parent anyone can see it should be Peeta As I drift off I try to imagine that world somewhere in the future with no Games no Capitol A place like the meadow in the song I sang to Rue as she died Where Peetas child could be safe When I wake I have a brief delicious feeling of happiness that is somehow connected with Peeta Happiness of course is a complete absurdity at this point since at the rate things are going Ill be dead in a day And thats the bestcase scenario if Im able to eliminate the restof the field including myself and get Peeta crowned as the winner of the Quarter Quell Still the sensations so unexpected and sweet I cling to it if only for a few moments Before the gritty sand the hot sun and my itching skin demand a return to reality Everyones already up and watching the descent of a parachute to the beach I join them for another delivery of bread Its identical to the one we received the night before Twentyfour rolls from District  That gives us thirtythree in all We each take five leaving eight in reserve No one says it but eight will divide up perfectly after the next death Somehow in the light of day joking about who will be around to eat the rolls has lost its humor How long can we keep this alliance I dont think anyone expected the number of tributes to drop so quickly What if I am wrong about the others protecting Peeta If things were simply coincidental or its all been a strategy towin our trust to make us easy prey or I dont understand whats actually going on Wait theres noifs about that I dont understand whats going on And if I dont its time for Peeta and me to clear out of here I sit next to Peeta on the sand to eat my rolls For some reason its difficult to look at him Maybe it was all that kissing last night although the two of us kissing isnt anything new It might not even have felt any different for him Maybe its knowing the brief amount of time we have left And how were working at such cross purposes when it comes to who should survive these Games After we eat I take his hand and tug him toward the water Come on Ill teach you how to swim I need to get him away from the others where we can discuss breaking away It will be tricky because once they realize were severing the alliance well be instanttargets If I was really teaching him to swim Id make him take off the belt since it keeps him afloat but what does it matter now So I just show him the basic stroke and let him practice going back and forth in waisthigh water At first I notice Johanna keeping a careful eye on us but eventually she loses interest and goes to take a nap Finnicks weaving a new net out of vines and Beetee plays with his wire I know the time has come While Peeta has been swimming Ive discovered something My remaining scabs are starting to peel off By gently rubbing a handful of sand up and down my arm I clean off the rest of the scales revealing fresh new skin underneath I stop Peetas practice on the pretext of showing him how to rid himself of the itchy scabs and as we scrub ourselves I bring up our escape Look the pool is down to eight I think its time we took off I say under my breath although I doubt any of the tributescan hear me Peeta nods and I can see him considering my proposition Weighing if the odds will be in our favor Tell you what he says Lets stick around until Brutus and Enobaria are dead I think Beetees trying to put together some kind of trap for them now Then I promise well go Im not entirely convinced But if we leave now well have two sets of adversaries after us Maybe three because who knows what Chaffs up to Plus the clock to contend with And then theres Beetee to think of Johanna only brought him for me and if we leave shell surely kill him Then I remember I cant protect Beetee too There can only be one victor and it has to be Peeta I must accept this I must make decisions based on his survival only All right I say Well stay until the Careers are dead But thats the end of it I turn and wave to Finnick Hey Finnick come on in We figured out how to make you pretty again The three of us scour allthe scabs from our bodies helping with the others backs and come out the same pink as the sky We apply another round of medicine because the skin seems too delicate for the sunlight but it doesnt look half as bad on smooth skin and will be good camouflage in the jungleBeetee calls us over and it turns out that during all those hours of fiddling with wire he has indeed come up with a plan I think well all agree our next job is to kill Brutus and Enobaria he says mildly I doubt theyll attack us openly again now that theyre so outnumbered We could track them down I suppose but its dangerous exhausting work Do you think theyve figured out about the clock I ask If they havent theyll figure it out soon enough Perhaps not as specifically as we have But they must know that at least some of the zones are wired for attacks and that theyrereoccurring in a circular fashion Also the fact that our last fight was cut off by Gamemaker intervention will not have gone unnoticed by them We know it was an attempt to disorient us but they must be asking themselves why it was done and this too may lead them to the realization that the arenas a clock says Beetee So I think our best bet will be setting our own trap Wait let me get Johanna up says Finnick Shell be rabid if she thinks she missed something this important Or not I mutter since shes always pretty much rabid but I dont stop him because Id be angry myself if I was excluded from a plan at this point When shes joined us Beetee shoos us all back a bit so he can have room to work in the sand He swiftly draws a circle and divides it into twelve wedges Its the arena not rendered inPeetas precise strokes but in the rough lines of a man whose mind is occupied by other far more complex things If you wereBrutus and Enobaria knowing what you do now about the jungle where would you feel safest Beetee asks Theres nothing patronizing in his voice and yet I cant help thinking he reminds me of a schoolteacher about to ease children into a lesson Perhaps its the age difference or simply that Beetee is probably about a million times smarter than the rest of us Where we are now On the beach says Peeta Its the safest place So why arent they on the beach says Beetee Because were here says Johanna impatiently Exactly Were here claiming the beach Now where would you go says Beetee I think about the deadly jungle the occupied beach Id hide just at the edge of the jungle So I could escape if an attack came And so I could spy on us Also to eat Finnick says The jungles full of strange creatures and plants But by watching us Id know the seafoods safe Beetee smiles at us as if weve exceeded hisexpectations Yes good You do see Now heres what I propose a twelve oclock strike What happens exactly at noon and at midnight The lightning bolt hits the tree I say Yes So what Im suggesting is that after the bolt hits at noon but before it hits at midnight we run my wire from that tree all the way down into the saltwater which is of course highly conductive When the bolt strikes the electricity will traveldown the wire and into not only the water but also the surrounding beach which will still be damp from the ten oclock wave Anyone in contact with those surfaces at that moment will be electrocuted says Beetee Theres a long pause while we all digest Beetees plan It seems a bit fantastical to me impossible even But why Ive set thousands of snares Isnt this just a larger snare with a morescientific component Could it work How can we even question it we tributes trained to gather fish and lumber and coal What do we know about harnessing power from the sky Peeta takes a stab at it Will that wire really be able to conduct that much power Beetee It looks so fragile like it would just burn up Oh it will But not until the current has passed through it It will act something like a fuse in fact Except the electricity will travel along it says Beetee How do you know asks Johanna clearly not convinced Because I invented it says Beetee as if slightly surprised Its not actually wire in the usual sense Nor is the lightning natural lightning nor the tree a real tree Youknow trees better than any of us Johanna It would be destroyed by now wouldnt it Yes she says glumly Dont worry about the wire  it will do just what I say Beeteeassures us And where will we be when this happens asks Finnick Far enough up in the jungle to be safe Beetee replies The Careers will be safe too then unless theyre in the vicinity of the water I point out Thats right says Beetee But all the seafood will be cooked says Peeta Probably more than cooked says Beetee We will most likely be eliminating that as a food source for good But you found other edible things in the jungle right Katniss Yes Nuts and rats I say And we have sponsors Well then I dont see that as a problem says Beetee But as we are allies and this will require all our efforts the decision of whether or not to attempt it is up to you four We are like schoolchildren Completely unable to dispute his theory with anything but the most elementary concerns Most of which dont even have anything to do with his actual plan I look at the others disconcerted faces Why not I say If itfails theres no harm done If it works theres a decent chance well kill them And even if we dont and just kill the seafood Brutus and Enobaria lose it as a food source too I say we try it says Peeta Katniss is right Finnick looks at Johanna and raises his eyebrows He will not go forward without her All right she says finally Its better than hunting them down in the jungle anyway And I doubt theyll figure out our plan since we can barely understand it ourselves Beetee wants to inspect the lightning tree before he has to rig it Judging by the sun its about nine in the morning We have to leave our beach soon anyway So we break camp walk over to the beach that borders the lightning section and head into the jungle Beetees still too weak to hike up the slope on his own so Finnick and Peeta take turns carrying him I let Johanna lead because its a pretty straight shot up to the tree and I figure she cant getus too lost Besides I can do a lot more damage with a sheath of arrows than she can with two axes so Im the best one to bring up the rear The dense muggy air weighs on me Theres been no break from it since the Games began I wish Haymitch would stop sending us that District  bread and get us some more of that District  stuff because Ive sweated out buckets in the last two days and even though Ive had the fish Im craving salt A piece of ice would be another good idea Or a cold drink of water Im grateful for the fluid from the trees but its the same temperature as the seawater and the air and the other tributes and me Were all just one big warm stew As we near the tree Finnick suggests I take the lead Katniss can hear the force field he explains to Beetee and Johanna Hear it asks Beetee Only withthe ear the Capitol reconstructed I say Guess whoIm not fooling with that story Beetee Because surely he remembers that he showed me how to spot a force field and probably its impossible to hear force fields anyway But for whatever reason he doesnt question my claim Then by all means let Katniss go first he says pausing a moment to wipe the steam off his glasses Force fields are nothing to play around with The lightning trees unmistakable as it towers so high above the others I find a bunch of nuts and make everybody wait while I move slowly up the slope tossing the nuts ahead of me But I see the force field almost immediately even before a nut hits it because its only about fifteen yards away My eyes which are sweeping the greenery before me catch sight of the rippled square high up and to my right I throw a nut directly in front of me and hear it sizzle in confirmation Just stay below the lightning tree I tell the others We divide upduties Finnick guards Beetee while he examines the tree Johanna taps for water Peeta gathers nuts and I hunt nearby The tree rats dont seem to have any fear of humans so I take down three easily The sound of the ten oclock wave reminds me I should get back and I return to the others and clean my kill Then I draw a line in the dirt a few feet from the force field as a reminder to keep back and Peeta and I settle down to roast nuts and sear cubes of rat Beetee is still messing around the tree doing I dont know what taking measurements and such At one point he snaps off a sliver of bark joins us and throws it against the force field It bounces back and lands on the ground glowing In a few moments it returns to its original color Well that explains a lot says Beetee I look at Peeta and cant help biting my lip to keep from laughing since it explains absolutely nothing to anyone but Beetee About this time wehear the sound of clicks rising from the sector adjacent to us That means its eleven oclock Its far louder in the jungle than it was on the beach last night We all listen intently Its not mechanical Beetee says decidedly Id guess insects I say Maybe beetles Something with pincers adds Finnick The sound swells as if alerted by our quiet words to the proximity of live flesh Whatever is making that clicking I bet it could strip us to the bone in seconds We should get out of here anyway says Johanna Theres less than an hour before the lightning starts We dont go that far though Only to the identical tree in the bloodrain section We have a picnic of sorts squatting on the ground eating our jungle food waiting for the bolt that signals noon At Beetees request I climb up into the canopy as the clicking begins to fade out When the lightning strikes its dazzling even from here even in this bright sunlight Itcompletely encompasses the distant tree making it glow ahot bluewhite and causing the surrounding air to crackle with electricity I swing down and report my findings to Beetee who seems satisfied even if Im not terribly scientific We take a circuitous route back to the ten oclock beach The sand is smooth and damp swept clean by the recent wave Beetee essentially gives us the afternoon off while he works with the wire Since its his weapon and the rest of us have to defer to his knowledge so entirely theres the odd feeling of being let out of school early At first we take turns having naps in the shadowy edge of the jungle but by late afternoon everyone is awake and restless We decide since this might be our last chance for seafood to make a sort of feast of it Under Finnicks guidance we spear fish and gather shellfish even dive for oysters I like this last partbest not because I have any great appetite for oysters I only ever tasted them once in the Capitol and I couldnt get around the sliminess But its lovely deep down under the water like being in a different world The waters very clear and schools of brighthued fish and strange sea flowers decorate the sand floor Johanna keeps watch while Finnick Peeta and I clean and lay out the seafood Peetas just pried open an oyster when I hear him give a laugh Hey look at this He holds up a glistening perfect pearl about the size of a pea You know if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to pearls he says earnestly to Finnick No it doesnt says Finnick dismissively But I crack up remembering thats how a clueless Effie Trinket presented us to the people of the Capitol last year before anyone knew us As coal pressured into pearls by our weighty existence Beauty that arose out of pain Peeta rinses the pearl off in the water and hands it tome For you I hold it out on my palm and examine its iridescent surface in the sunlight Yes I will keep it For the few remaining hours of my life I will keep it close This last gift from Peeta The only one I can really accept Perhaps it will give me strength in the final moments Thanks I say closing my fist around it I look coolly into the blue eyes of the person who is now my greatest opponent the person who would keep me alive at his own expense And I promise myself I will defeat his plan The laughter drains from those eyes and they are staring so intensely into mine its like they can read my thoughts The locket didnt work did it Peeta says even though Finnick is right there Even though everyone can hear him Katniss It worked I say But not the way I wanted it to he says averting his glance After that he will look at nothing but oysters Just as were about to eat a parachute appears bearing two supplements to ourmeal A small pot of spicy red sauce and yet another round of rolls from District  Finnick of course immediately counts them Twentyfour again he says Thirtytwo rollsthen So we each take five leaving seven which will never divide equally Its bread for only one The salty fish flesh the succulent shellfish Even the oysters seem tasty vastly improved by the sauce We gorge ourselves until no one can hold another bite and even then there are leftovers They wont keep though so we toss all the remaining food back into the water so the Careers wont get it when we leave No one bothers about the shells The wave should clear those away Theres nothing to do now but wait Peeta and I sit at the edge of the water hand in hand wordless He gave his speech last night but it didnt change my mind and nothing I can say will change his The time for persuasivegifts is over I have the pearl though secured in a parachute with the spile and the medicine at my waist I hope it makes it back to District  Surely my mother and Prim will know to return it to Peeta before they bury my body The anthem begins but there are no faces in the sky tonight The audience will be restless thirsting for blood Beetees trap holds enough promise though that the Gamemakers havent sent in other attacks Perhaps they are simply curious to see if it will work At what Finnick and I judge to be about nine we leave our shellstrewn camp cross to the twelve oclock beach and begin to quietly hike up to the lightning tree in the light of the moon Our full stomachs make us more uncomfortable and breathless than we were on the mornings climb I begin to regret those last dozen oysters Beetee asks Finnick to assist him and the rest of us stand guard Before he even attaches any wire to thetree Beetee unrolls yards and yards of the stuff He has Finnick secure it tightly around a broken branch and lay it on the ground Then they stand on either side of the tree passing the spool back and forth as they wrap the wire around and around the trunk At first it seems arbitrary then I see a pattern like an intricate maze appearing in the moonlight on Beetees side I wonder if it makes any difference how the wires placed or if this is merely to add to the speculation of the audience I bet most of them know as much about electricity as I do The work on the trunks completed just as we hear the wave begin Ive never really worked out at what point in the ten oclock hour it erupts There must be some buildup then the wave itself then the aftermath of the flooding But the sky tells me tenthirty This is when Beetee reveals the rest of the plan Since we move most swiftly through the trees he wants Johanna andme to take the coil down through the jungle unwinding the wire as we go We are to lay it across the twelve oclock beach and drop the metal spool with whatever is left deep into the water making sure it sinks Then run for the jungle If we go now right now we should make it to safety I want to go with them as a guard Peeta says immediately After the moment with thepearl I know hes less willing than ever to let me out of his sight Youre too slow Besides Ill need you on this end Katniss will guard says Beetee Theres no time to debate this Im sorry If the girls are to get out of there alive they need to move now He hands the coil to Johanna I dont like the plan any more than Peeta does How can I protect him at a distance But Beetees right With his leg Peeta is too slow to make it down the slope in time Johanna and I are thefastest and most surefooted on the jungle floor I cant think of any alternative And if I trust anyone here besides Peeta its Beetee Its okay I tell Peeta Well just drop the coil and come straight back up Not into the lightning zone Beetee reminds me Head for the tree in the onetotwooclock sector If you find youre running out of time move over one more Dont even think about going back on the beach though until I can assess the damageI take Peetas face in my hands Dont worry Ill see you at midnight I give him a kiss and before he can object any further I let go and turn to Johanna Ready Why not says Johanna with a shrug Shes clearly no happier about being teamed up than I am But were all caught up in Beetees trap You guard Ill unwind We can trade off later Without further discussion we head down the slope In facttheres very little discussion between us at all We move at a pretty good clip one manning the coil the other keeping watch About halfway down we hear the clicking beginning to rise indicating its after eleven Better hurry Johanna says I want to put a lot of distance between me and that water before the lightning hits Just in case Volts miscalculated something Ill take the coil for a while I say Its harder work laying out the wire than guarding and shes had a long turn Here Johanna says passing me the coil Both of our hands are still on the metal cylinder when theres a slight vibration Suddenly the thin golden wire from above springs down at us bunching in tangled loops and curls around our wrists Then the severed end snakes up to our feet It only takes a second to register this rapid turn of events Johanna and I look at each other but neither of us has to say it Someone not far above us has cut the wire Andthey will be on us at any moment My hand frees itself from the wire and has just closed on the feathers of an arrow when the metal cylinder smashes into the side of my head The next thing I know Im lying on my back in the vines a terrible pain in my left temple Somethings wrong with my eyes My vision blurs in and out of focus as I strain to make the two moons floating up in the sky into one Its hard to breathe and I realize Johannas sitting on my chest pinning me at the shoulders with her knees Theres a stab in my left forearm I try to jerk away but Im still too incapacitated Johannas digging something I guess the point of her knife into my flesh twisting it around Theres an excruciating ripping sensation and warmth runs down my wrist filling my palm She swipes down my arm and coats half my face with my blood Stay down she hisses Her weight leaves my body and Im alone Stay down I think What What ishappening My eyes shut blocking out the inconsistent world as I try to make sense of my situation All I can think of is Johanna shoving Wiress to the beach Just stay down will you But she didnt attack Wiress Not like this Im not Wiress anyway Im not Nuts Just stay down will you echoes around inside my brain Footsteps coming Two pairs Heavy not trying to conceal their whereabouts Brutuss voice Shes good as dead Come on Enobaria Feet moving into the night Am I I drift in and out of consciousness looking for an answer Am I as good as dead Im in no position to make an argument to thecontrary In fact rational thinking is a struggle This much I know Johanna attacked me Smashed that cylinder into my head Cut my arm probably doing irreparable damage to veins and arteries and then Brutus and Enobariashowed up before she had time to finish me off The alliance is over Finnick and Johanna must have had an agreement to turn on us tonight I knew we should have left this morning I dont know where Beetee stands But Im fair game and so is Peeta Peeta My eyes fly open in panic Peeta is waiting up by the tree unsuspecting and off guard Maybe Finnick has even killed him already No I whisper That wire was cut from a short distance away by the Careers Finnick and Beetee and Peetathey cant know whats going on down here They can only be wondering what has happened why the wire has gone slack or maybe even sprung back to the tree This in itself cant be a signal to kill can it Surely this was just Johanna deciding the time had come to break with us Kill me Escape from the Careers Then bring Finnick into the fight as soon as possible I dont know I dont know I only know that I must get back to Peetaand keep him alive It takes every ounce of will I have to push up into a sitting position and drag myself up the side of a tree to my feet Its lucky I have something to hold on to because the jungles tilting back and forth Without any warning I lean forward and vomit up the seafood feast heaving until there cant possibly be an oyster left in my body Trembling and slick with sweat I assess my physical condition As I lift up my damaged arm blood sprays me in the face and the world makes another alarming shift I squeeze my eyes shut and cling to the tree until things steady a little Then I take a few careful steps to a neighboring tree pull off some moss and without examining the wound further tightly bandage my arm Better Definitely better not to see it Then I allow my hand to tentatively touch my head wound Theres a huge lump but not too much blood Obviously Ive got some internaldamage but I dont seem in danger of bleeding to death At least not through my head I dry my hands on moss and get a shaky grip on my bow with my damaged left arm Secure the notch of an arrow to the string Make my feet move up the slope Peeta My dying wish My promise To keep him alive My heart lifts a bit when I realize he must be alive because no cannon has fired Maybe Johanna was acting alone knowing Finnick would side with her once her intentions were clear Although its hard to guess what goes on between those two I think of how he looked to her for confirmation before hed agree to help set Beetees trap Theres a much deeper alliance based on years of friendship and who knows what else Therefore if Johanna has turned on me I should no longer trust Finnick I reach this conclusion only seconds before I hear someone running down the slope toward me Neither Peetanor Beetee could move at this pace I duck behind a curtain of vines concealing myself just in time Finnick flies by me his skin shadowy with medicine leaping through the undergrowth like a deer He soon reaches the sight of my attack must see the blood Johanna Katniss he calls I stay put until he goes in the direction Johanna and the Careers took I move as quickly as I can without sending the world into a whirl My head throbs with the rapid beat of my heart The insects possibly excited by the smell of blood have increased their clicking until its a continuous roar in my ears No wait Maybe my ears are actually ringing from the hit Until the insects shut up it will be impossible to tell But when the insects go silent the lightning will start I have to move faster I have to get to Peeta The boom of a cannon pulls me up short Someone has died I know that with everyone running around armed and scared right now itcould be anybody But whoever it is I believe the death will trigger a kind of freeforall out here in the night People will kill first and wonder about their motives later I force my legs into a run Something snags my feet and I sprawl out on the ground I feel it wrapping around me entwining me in sharp fibers A net This must be one of Finnicks fancy nets positioned to trap me and he must be nearby trident in hand I flail around for a moment only working the web more tightly around me and then I catch a glimpse of it in the moonlight Confused I lift my arm and see its entangled in shimmering golden threads Its not one of Finnicks nets at all but Beetees wire I carefully rise to my feet and find Im in a patch of the stuff that caught on a trunk on its way back to the lightning tree Slowly I disengage myself from the wire step out of its reach and continue uphill On the good side Im on the right path andhave not been so disoriented by the head injury as to lose my sense of direction On the bad side the wire has reminded me of the oncoming lightning storm I can still hear the insects but are they starting to fade I keep the loops of wire a few feet to my left as a guide as I run but take great care not to touch them If those insects are fading and the first bolt is about to strike the tree then all its power will come surging down that wire and anyone in contact with it will die The tree swims into view its trunk festooned with gold I slow down try to move with some stealth but Im really just lucky to be upright I look for a sign of the others No one No one is there Peeta I call softly Peeta A soft moan answers me and I whip around to find a figure lying higher up on the ground Beetee I exclaim I hurry and kneel beside him The moan must have been involuntary Hes not conscious although I can see no wound except agash below the crook of his elbow I grab a nearby handful of moss and clumsily wrap it while I try to rouse himBeetee Beetee whats going on Who cut you Beetee I shake him in the way you should never shake an injured person but I dont know what else to do He moans again and briefly raises a hand to ward me off This is when I notice hes holding a knife one Peeta was carrying earlier I think which is wrapped loosely in wire Perplexed I stand and lift the wire confirming its attached back at the tree It takes me a moment to remember the second much shorter strand that Beetee wound around a branch and left on the ground before he even began his design on the tree Id thought it had some electrical significance had been set aside to be used later But it never was because theres probably a good twenty twentyfive yards here I squint hard up the hill and realizewere only a few paces from the force field Theres the telltale square high up and to my right just as it was this morning What did Beetee do Did he actually try to drive the knife into the force field the way Peeta did by accident And whats the deal with the wire Was this his backup plan If electrifying the water failed did he mean to send the lightning bolts energy into the force field What would that do anyway Nothing A great deal Fry us all The force field must mostly be energy too I guess The one in the Training Center was invisible This one seems to somehow mirror the jungle But Ive seen it falter when Peetas knife struck it and when my arrows hit The real world lies right behind it My ears are not ringing It was the insects after all I know that now because they are dying out quickly and I hear nothing but the jungle sounds Beetee is useless I cant rouse him I cant save him I dont know what he was tryingto do with the knife and the wire and hes incapable of explaining The moss bandage on my arm is soaked and theres no use fooling myself Im so lightheaded Ill black out in a matter of minutes Ive got to get away from this tree and Katniss I hear his voice though hes a far distance away But what is he doing Peeta must have figured out that everyone is hunting us by now Katniss I cant protect him I cant move fast or far and my shooting abilities are questionable at best I do the one thing I can to draw the attackers away from him and over to me Peeta I scream out Peeta Im here Peeta Yes I will draw them in any in my vicinity away from Peeta and over to me and the lightning tree that will soon be a weapon in and of itself Im here Im here He wont make it Not with that leg in the night He will never make it in time Peeta Its working I can hear them coming Two of them Crashing through thejungle My knees start to give out and I sink down next to Beetee resting my weight on my heels My bow and arrow lift into position If I can take them out will Peeta survive the rest Enobaria and Finnick reach the lightning tree They cant see me sitting above them onthe slope my skin camouflaged in ointment I home in on Enobarias neck With any luck when I kill her Finnick will duck behind the tree for cover just as the lightning bolt strikes And it will be any second Theres only a faint insect click here and there I can kill them now I can kill them both Another cannon Katniss Peetas voice howls for me But this time I dont answer Beetee still breathes faintly beside me He and I will soon die Finnick and Enobaria will die Peeta is alive Two cannons have sounded Brutus Johanna Chaff Two of them are already dead That willleave Peeta with only one tribute to kill And that is the very best I can do One enemy Enemy Enemy The word is tugging at a recent memory Pulling it into the present The look on Haymitchs face Katniss when youre in the arena  The scowl the misgiving What I hear my own voice tighten as I bristle at some unspoken accusation You just remember who the enemy is Haymitch says Thats all Haymitchs last words of advice to me Why would I need reminding I have always known who the enemy is Who starves and tortures and kills us in the arena Who will soon kill everyone I love My bow drops as his meaning registers Yes I know who the enemy is And its not Enobaria I finally see Beetees knife with clear eyes My shaking hands slide the wire from the hilt wind it around the arrow just above the feathers and secure it with a knot picked up in training I rise turning to the force field fully revealing myself but no longer caring Only caring about where I should direct my tip where Beetee would have driven the knife if hed been able to choose My bow tilts up at the wavering square the flaw the  what did he call it that day The chink in the armor I let the arrow fly see it hit its mark and vanish pulling the thread of gold behind it My hair stands on end and the lightning strikes the tree A flash of white runs up the wire and for just a moment the dome bursts into a dazzling blue light Im thrown backward to the ground body useless paralyzed eyes frozen wide as feathery bits of matter rain down on me I cant reach Peeta I cant even reach my pearl My eyes strain to capture one last image of beauty to take with me Right before the explosions begin I find a star Everything seems to erupt at once The earth explodes into showers of dirt and plantmatter Trees burst into flames Even the sky fills with brightly colored blossoms of light I cant think why the skys being bombed until I realize the Gamemakers are shooting off fireworks up there while the real destruction occurs on the ground Just in case its not enough fun watching the obliteration of the arena and the remaining tributes Or perhaps to illuminate our gory ends Will they let anyone survive Will there be a victor of the Seventyfifth Hunger Games Maybe not After all what is this Quarter Quell but  what was it President Snow read from the card  a reminder to the rebels that even the strongest among them cannot overcome the power of the Capitol Not even the strongest of the strong will triumph Perhaps they never intended to have a victor in these Games at all Or perhaps my final act of rebellion forced their hand Im sorry Peeta I think Im sorry I couldnt save you Save him More likely Istole his last chance at life condemned him by destroying the force field Maybe if we had all played by the rules they might have let him live The hovercraft materializes above me without warning If it was quiet and a mockingjay perched close at hand I would have heard the jungle go silent and then the birds call that precedes the appearance of the Capitols aircraft But my ears could never make out anything so delicate in this bombardment The claw drops from the underside until its directly overhead The metal talons slide under me I want to scream run smash my way out of it but Im frozen helpless to do anything but fervently hope Ill die before I reach the shadowy figures awaiting me above They have not spared my life to crown me victor but to make my death as slow and public as possible My worst fears are confirmed when the face that greets me inside the hovercraft belongs to PlutarchHeavensbee Head Gamemaker What a mess I have made of his beautiful Games with the clever ticking clock and the field of victors He will suffer forhis failure probably lose his life but not before he sees me punished His hand reaches for me I think to strike me but he does something worse With his thumb and his forefinger he slides my eyelids shut sentencing me to the vulnerability of darkness They can do anything to me now and I will not even see it coming My heart pounds so hard the blood begins to stream from beneath my soaked moss bandage My thoughts grow foggy Possibly I can bleed to death before they can revive me after all In my mind I whisper a thankyou to Johanna Mason for the excellent wound she inflicted as I black out When I swim back into semi consciousness I can feel Im lying on a padded tableTheres the pinching sensation of tubes in my left arm They are trying to keep me alive because if I slide quietly privately into death it will be a victory Im still largely unable to move open my eyelids raise my head But my right arm has regained a little motion It flops across my body feeling like a flipper no something less animated like a club I have no real motor coordination no proof that I even still have fingers Yet I manage to swing my arm around until I rip the tubes out A beeping goes off but I cant stay awake to find out who it will summon The next time I surface my hands are tied down to the table the tubes back in my arm I can open my eyes and lift my head slightly though Im in a large room with low ceilings and a silvery light There are two rows of beds facing each other I can hear the breathing of what I assume are my fellow victors Directly across from me I see Beetee with about ten differentmachines hooked up to him Just let us die I scream in my mind I slam my head back hard on the table and go out again When I finally truly wake up the restraints are gone I raise my hand and find I have fingers that can move at my command again I push myself to a sitting position and hold on to the padded table until the room settles into focus My left arm is bandaged but the tubes dangle off stands by the bed Im alone except for Beetee who still lies in front of me being sustained by his army of machines Where are the others then Peeta Finnick Enobaria andandone more right Either Johanna or Chaff or Brutus was still alive when the bombs began Im sure theyll want to make an example of us all But where have they taken them Moved them from hospital to prison Peeta I whisper I so wanted to protect him Am still resolved to Since I have failed to keep him safe in life I must find him kill him now before theCapitol gets to choose the agonizing means of his death I slide my legs off the table and look around for a weapon There are a few syringes sealed in sterile plastic on a table near Beetees bed Perfect All Ill need is air and a clear shot at one of his veins I pause for a moment consider killing Beetee But if I do the monitors will start beeping and Ill becaught before I get to Peeta I make a silent promise to return and finish him off if I can Im naked except for a thin nightgown so I slip the syringe under the bandage that covers the wound on my arm There are no guards at the door No doubt Im miles beneath the Training Center or in some Capitol stronghold and the possibility of my escape is nonexistent It doesnt matter Im not escaping just finishing a job I creep down a narrow hallway to a metal door that stands slightly ajar Someone is behind it I takeout the syringe and grip it in my hand Flattening myself against the wall I listen to the voices inside Communications are down in Seven Ten and Twelve But Eleven has control of transportation now so theres at least a hope of them getting some food out Plutarch Heavensbee I think Although Ive only really spoken with him once A hoarse voice asks a question No Im sorry Theres no way I can get you to Four But Ive given special orders for her retrieval if possible Its the best I can do Finnick Finnick My mind struggles to make sense of the conversation of the fact that its taking place between Plutarch Heavensbee and Finnick Is he so near and dear to the Capitol that hell be excused his crimes Or did he really have no idea what Beetee intended He croaks out something else Something heavy with despair Dont be stupid Thats the worst thing you could do Get her killed for sure As long as youre alivetheyll keep her alive for bait says Haymitch Says Haymitch I bang through the door and stumble into the room Haymitch Plutarch and a very beatup Finnick sit around a table laid with a meal no one is eating Daylight streams in the curved windows and in the distance I see the top of a forest of trees We are flying Done knocking yourself out sweetheart says Haymitch the annoyance clear in his voice But as I careen forward he steps up and catches my wrists steadying me He looks at my hand So its you and a syringe against the Capitol See this is why no one lets you make the plans I stare at him uncomprehendingly Drop it I feel the pressure increase on my right wrist until my hand is forced to open and I release the syringe He settles me in a chair next to Finnick Plutarch puts a bowl of broth in front of me A roll Slips a spoon into my hand Eat he says in a much kinder voicethan Haymitch used Haymitch sits directly in front of me Katniss Im going to explain what happened I dont want you to ask any questions until Im through Do you understand I nod numbly And this is what he tells me There was a plan to break us out of the arena from the moment the Quell was announced The victor tributes from      and  had varying degrees of knowledge about it Plutarch Heavensbee has been for several years part of an undercover group aiming to overthrow the Capitol He made sure the wire was among the weaponsBeetee was in charge of blowing a hole in the force field The bread we received in the arena was code for the time of the rescue The district where the bread originated indicated the day Three The number of rolls the hour Twentyfour The hovercraft belongs to District  Bonnieand Twill the women I met in the woods from  were right about its existence and its defense capabilities We are currently on a very roundabout journey to District  Meanwhile most of the districts in Panem are in fullscale rebellion Haymitch stops to see if I am following Or maybe he is done for the moment Its an awful lot to take in this elaborate plan in which I was a piece just as I was meant to be a piece in the Hunger Games Used without consent without knowledge At least in the Hunger Games I knew I was being played with My supposed friends have been a lot more secretive You didnt tell me My voice is as ragged as Finnicks Neither you nor Peeta were told We couldnt risk it says Plutarch I was even worried you might mention my indiscretion with the watch during the Games He pulls out his pocket watch and runs his thumb across the crystal lighting up the mockingjay Of course when I showed youthis I was merely tipping you off about the arena As a mentor I thought it might be a first step toward gaining your trust I never dreamed youd be a tribute again I still dont understand why Peeta and I werent let in on the plan I say Because once the force field blew youd be the first ones theyd try to capture and the less you knew the better says Haymitch The first ones Why I say trying to hang on to the train of thought For the same reason the rest of us agreed to die to keep you alive says Finnick No Johanna tried to kill me I say Johanna knocked you out to cut the tracker from your arm and lead Brutus and Enobaria away from you says Haymitch What My head aches so and I want them to stop talking in circles I dont know what youre We had to save you because youre the mockingjay Katniss says Plutarch While you live the revolution lives The bird the pin the song the berries thewatch the cracker the dress that burst into flames I am the mockingjay The one that survived despite the Capitols plans The symbol of the rebellion Its what I suspected in the woods when I found Bonnie and Twill escaping Though I never really understood the magnitude But then I wasnt meant to understand I think of Haymitchs sneering at my plans to flee District  start my own uprising even the very notion that District  could exist Subterfuges and deceptions And if he could do that behind his mask of sarcasm and drunkenness so convincingly and for so long what else has he lied about I know what else Peeta I whisper my heart sinking The others kept Peeta alive because if he died we knew thered be no keeping you inan alliance says Haymitch And we couldnt risk leaving you unprotected His words are matteroffact hisexpression unchanged but he cant hide the tinge of gray that colors his face Where is Peeta I hiss at him He was picked up by the Capitol along with Johanna and Enobaria says Haymitch And finally he has the decency to drop his gaze Technically I am unarmed But no one should ever underestimate the harm that fingernails can do especially if the target is unprepared I lunge across the table and rake mine down Haymitchs face causing blood to flow and damage to one eye Then we are both screaming terrible terrible things at each other and Finnick is trying to drag me out and I know its all Haymitch can do not to rip me apart but Im the mockingjay Im the mockingjay and its too hard keeping me alive as it is Other hands help Finnick and Im back on my table my body restrained my wrists tied down so I slam my head in fury again and again against the table A needle pokes my arm and my head hurts so badly I stopfighting and simply wail in a horrible dyinganimal way until my voice gives out The drug causes sedation not sleep so I am trapped in fuzzy dully aching misery for what seems like always They reinsert their tubes and talk to me in soothingvoices that never reach me All I can think of is Peeta lying on a similar table somewhere while they try to break him for information he doesnt even have Katniss Katniss Im sorry Finnicks voice comes from the bed next to me and slips into my consciousness Perhaps because were in the same kind of pain I wanted to go back for him and Johanna but I couldnt move I dont answer Finnick Odairs good intentions mean less than nothing Its better for him than Johanna Theyll figure out he doesnt know anything pretty fast And they wont kill him if they thinkthey can use him against you says Finnick Like bait I say to the ceiling Like how theyll use Annie for bait Finnick I can hear him weeping but I dont care They probably wont even bother to question her shes so far gone Gone right off the deep end years ago in her Games Theres a good chance Im headed in the same direction Maybe Im already going crazy and no one has the heart to tell me I feel crazy enough I wish she was dead he says I wish they were all dead and we were too It would be best Well theres no good response to that I can hardly dispute it since I was walking around with a syringe to kill Peeta when I found them Do I really want him dead What I want  what I want is to have him back But Ill never get him back now Even if the rebel forces could somehow overthrow the Capitol you can be sure President Snows last act would be to cut Peetas throat No I will never get him back So thendead is best But will Peeta know that or will he keep fighting Hes so strong and such a good liar Does he think he has a chance of surviving Does he even care if he does He wasnt planning on it anyway He had already signed off on life Maybe if he knows I was rescued hes even happy Feels he fulfilled his mission to keep me alive I think I hate him even more than I do Haymitch I give up Stop speaking responding refuse food and water They can pump whatever they want into my arm but it takes more than that to keep a person going once shes lost the will to live I even have a funny notion that if I do die maybe Peeta will be allowed to live Not as a free person but as an Avox or something waiting on the future tributes of District  Then maybe he could find some way to escape My death could in fact still save him If it cant no matter Its enough to die of spite To punish Haymitch who of all the people in this rotting worldhas turned Peeta and me into pieces in his Games I trusted him I put what was precious in Haymitchs hands And he has betrayed me See this is why no one lets you make the plans he said Thats true No one in their right mind would let me make the plans Because I obviously cant tell a friend from an enemy A lot of people come by to talk to me but I make all their words sound like the clicking of the insects in the jungle Meaningless anddistant Dangerous but only if approached Whenever the words start to become distinct I moan until they give me more painkiller and that fixes things right up Until one time I open my eyes and find someone I cannot block out looking down at me Someone who will not plead or explain or think he can alter my design with entreaties because he alone really knows how I operate Gale I whisper HeyCatnip He reaches down and pushes a strand of hair out of my eyes One side of his face has been burned fairly recently His arm is in a sling and I can see bandages under his miners shirt What has happened to him How is he even here Something very bad has happened back home It is not so much a question of forgetting Peeta as remembering the others All it takes is one look at Gale and they come surging into the present demanding to be acknowledged Prim I gasp Shes alive So is your mother I got them out in time he says Theyre not in District Twelve I ask After the Games they sent in planes Dropped firebombs He hesitates Well you know what happened to the Hob I do know I saw it go up That old warehouse embedded with coal dust The whole districts covered with the stuff A new kind of horror begins to rise up inside me as I imagine firebombs hitting the Seam Theyre not in District TwelveI repeat As if saying it will somehow fend off the truth Katniss Gale says softly I recognize that voice Its the same one he uses to approach wounded animals before he delivers a deathblow I instinctively raise my hand to block his words but he catches it and holds on tightly Dont I whisper But Gale is not one to keep secrets from me Katniss there is no District Twelve END OF BOOK TWOI stop trying to sleep after my first few attempts areinterrupted by unspeakable nightmares After that I just liestill and do fake breathing whenever someone checks onme In the morning Im released from the hospital andinstructed to take it easy Cressida asks me to record afew lines for a new Mockingjay propo At lunch I keepwaiting for people to bring up Peetas appearance but noone does Someone must have seen it besides Finnickand meI have training but Gales scheduled to work withBeetee on weapons or something so I get permission totake Finnick to the woods We wander around awhile andthen ditch our communicators under a bush When were asafe distance away we sit and discuss Peetas broadcastI havent heard one word about it No ones told youanything Finnick says I shake my head He pausesbefore he asks Not even Gale Im clinging to a shred ofhope that Gale honestly knows nothing about Peetasmessage But I have a bad feeling he does Maybe hestrying to find a time to tell you privatelyMaybe I sayWe stay silent so long that a buck wanders into range Itake it down with an arrow Finnick hauls it back to thefenceFor dinner theres minced venison in the stew Galewalks me back to Compartment E after we eat When I askhim whats been going on again theres no mention ofPeeta As soon as my mother and sister are asleep I slipthe pearl from the drawer and spend a second sleeplessnight clutching it in my hand replaying Peetas words in myhead Ask yourself do you really trust the people youreworking with Do you really know whats going on And ifyou dontfind out Find out What From who And howcan Peeta know anything except what the Capitol tells himIts just a Capitol propo More noise But if Plutarch thinksits just the Capitol line why didnt he tell me about it Whyhasnt anyone let me or Finnick knowUnder this debate lies the real source of my distressPeeta What have they done to him And what are theydoing to him right now Clearly Snow did not buy the storythat Peeta and I knew nothing about the rebellion And hissuspicions have been reinforced now that I have come outas the Mockingjay Peeta can only guess about the rebeltactics or make up things to tell his torturers Lies oncediscovered would be severely punished How abandonedby me he must feel In his first interview he tried to protectme from the Capitol and rebels alike and not only have Ifailed to protect him Ive brought down more horrors uponhimCome morning I stick my forearm in the wall and staregroggily at the days schedule Immediately after breakfastI am slated for Production In the dining hall as I down myhot grain and milk and mushy beets I spot a communicuffon Gales wrist When did you get that back SoldierHawthorne I askYesterday They thought if Im going to be in the fieldwith you it could be a backup system of communicationsays GaleNo one has ever offered me a communicuff I wonderif I asked for one would I get it Well I guess one of ushas to be accessible I say with an edge to my voiceWhats that mean he saysNothing Just repeating what you said I tell him AndI totally agree that the accessible one should be you I justhope I still have access to you as wellOur eyes lock and I realize how furious I am with GaleThat I dont believe for a second that he didnt see Peetaspropo That I feel completely betrayed that he didnt tell meabout it We know each other too well for him not to readmy mood and guess what has caused itKatniss he begins Already the admission of guilt isin his toneI grab my tray cross to the deposit area and slam thedishes onto the rack By the time Im in the hallway hescaught up with meWhy didnt you say something he asks taking myarmWhy didnt I I jerk my arm free Why didnt youGale And I did by the way when I asked you last nightabout what had been going onIm sorry All right I didnt know what to do I wanted totell you but everyone was afraid that seeing Peetas propowould make you sick he saysThey were right It did But not quite as sick as youlying to me for Coin At that moment his communicuffstarts beeping There she is Better run You have things totell herFor a moment real hurt registers on his face Thencold anger replaces it He turns on his heel and goesMaybe I have been too spiteful not given him enough timeto explain Maybe everyone is just trying to protect me bylying to me I dont care Im sick of people lying to me formy own good Because really its mostly for their own goodLie to Katniss about the rebellion so she doesnt doanything crazy Send her into the arena without a clue so wecan fish her out Dont tell her about Peetas propo becauseit might make her sick and its hard enough to get a decentperformance out of her as it isI do feel sick Heartsick And too tired for a day ofproduction But Im already at Remake so I go in Today Idiscover we will be returning to District  Cressida wantsto do unscripted interviews with Gale and me throwing lighton our demolished cityIf youre both up for that says Cressida lookingclosely at my faceCount me in I say I stand uncommunicative andstiff a mannequin as my prep team dresses me does myhair and dabs makeup on my face Not enough to showonly enough to take the edge off the circles under mysleepless eyesBoggs escorts me down to the Hangar but we donttalk beyond a preliminary greeting Im grateful to be sparedanother exchange about my disobedience in  especiallysince his mask looks so uncomfortableAt the last moment I remember to send a message tomy mother about my leaving  and stress that it wont bedangerous We board a hovercraft for the short ride to and Im directed to a seat at a table where Plutarch Galeand Cressida are poring over a map Plutarchs brimmingwith satisfaction as he shows me the beforeafter effects ofthe first couple of propos The rebels who were barelymaintaining a foothold in several districts have rallied Theyhave actually taken  and the latter so crucial since itsPanems main food supplierand have made inroads inseveral other districts as wellHopeful Very hopeful indeed says PlutarchFulvias going to have the first round of We Rememberspots ready tonight so we can target the individual districtswith their dead Finnicks absolutely marvelousIts painful to watch actually says Cressida Heknew so many of them personallyThats what makes it so effective says PlutarchStraight from the heart Youre all doing beautifully Coincould not be more pleasedGale didnt tell them then About my pretending not tosee Peeta and my anger at their coverup But I guess itstoo little too late because I still cant let it go It doesntmatter Hes not speaking to me eitherIts not until we land in the Meadow that I realizeHaymitch isnt among our company When I ask Plutarchabout his absence he just shakes his head and says Hecouldnt face itHaymitch Not able to face something Wanted aday off more likely I sayI think his actual words were I couldnt face it without abottle says PlutarchI roll my eyes long out of patience with my mentor hisweakness for drink and what he can or cant confront Butabout five minutes after my return to  Im wishing I had abottle myself I thought Id come to terms with s demiseheard of it seen it from the air and wandered through itsashes So why does everything bring on a fresh pang ofgrief Was I simply too out of it before to fully register theloss of my world Or is it the look on Gales face as hetakes in the destruction on foot that makes the atrocity feelbrandnewCressida directs the team to start with me at my oldhouse I ask her what she wants me to do Whatever youfeel like she says Standing back in my kitchen I dont feellike doing anything In fact I find myself focusing up at theskythe only roof leftbecause too many memories aredrowning me After a while Cressida says Thats fineKatniss Lets move onGale doesnt get off so easily at his old addressCressida films him in silence for a few minutes but just ashe pulls the one remnant of his previous life from the ashesa twisted metal pokershe starts to question him about hisfamily his job life in the Seam She makes him go back tothe night of the firebombing and reenact it starting at hishouse working his way down across the Meadow andthrough the woods to the lake I straggle behind the filmcrew and the bodyguards feeling their presence to be aviolation of my beloved woods This is a private place asanctuary already corrupted by the Capitols evil Evenafter weve left behind the charred stumps near the fencewere still tripping over decomposing bodies Do we haveto record it for everyone to seeBy the time we reach the lake Gale seems to have losthis ability to speak Everyones dripping in sweatespecially Castor and Pollux in their insect shellsandCressida calls for a break I scoop up handfuls of waterfrom the lake wishing I could dive in and surface alone andnaked and unobserved I wander around the perimeter for awhile When I come back around to the little concrete housebeside the lake I pause in the doorway and see Galepropping the crooked poker he salvaged against the wallby the hearth For a moment I have an image of a lonestranger sometime far in the future wandering lost in thewilderness and coming upon this small place of refuge withthe pile of split logs the hearth the poker Wondering howit came to be Gale turns and meets my eyes and I knowhes thinking about our last meeting here When we foughtover whether or not to run away If we had would District still be there I think it would But the Capitol would still bein control of Panem as wellCheese sandwiches are passed around and we eatthem in the shade of the trees I intentionally sit at the faredge of the group next to Pollux so I dont have to talk Noones talking much really In the relative quiet the birdstake back the woods I nudge Pollux with my elbow andpoint out a small black bird with a crown It hops to a newbranch momentarily opening its wings showing off itswhite patches Pollux gestures to my pin and raises hiseyebrows questioningly I nod confirming its a mockingjayI hold up one finger to say Wait Ill show you and whistle abirdcall The mockingjay cocks its head and whistles thecall right back at me Then to my surprise Pollux whistles afew notes of his own The bird answers him immediatelyPolluxs face breaks into an expression of delight and hehas a series of melodic exchanges with the mockingjay Myguess is its the first conversation hes had in years Musicdraws mockingjays like blossoms do bees and in a shortwhile hes got half a dozen of them perched in the branchesover our heads He taps me on the arm and uses a twig towrite a word in the dirt SINGUsually Id decline but its kind of impossible to say noto Pollux given the circumstances Besides themockingjays song voices are different from their whistlesand Id like him to hear them So before I actually thinkabout what Im doing I sing Rues four notes the ones sheused to signal the end of the workday in  The notes thatended up as the background music to her murder Thebirds dont know that They pick up the simple phrase andbounce it back and forth between them in sweet harmonyJust as they did in the Hunger Games before the muttationsbroke through the trees chased us onto the Cornucopiaand slowly gnawed Cato to a bloody pulpWant to hear them do a real song I burst outAnything to stop those memories Im on my feet movingback into the trees resting my hand on the rough trunk of amaple where the birds perch I have not sung The HangingTree out loud for ten years because its forbidden but Iremember every word I begin softly sweetly as my fatherdidAre you are youComing to the treeWhere they strung up a man they saymurdered threeStrange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging treeThe mockingjays begin to alter their songs as theybecome aware of my new offeringAre you are youComing to the treeWhere the dead man called out for his loveto fleeStrange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging treeI have the birds attention now In one more versesurely they will have captured the melody as its simple andrepeats four times with little variationAre you are youComing to the treeWhere I told you to run so wed both be freeStrange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging treeA hush in the trees Just the rustle of leaves in thebreeze But no birds mockingjay or other Peetas rightThey do fall silent when I sing Just as they did for my fatherAre you are youComing to the treeWear a necklace of rope side by side withmeStrange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging treeThe birds are waiting for me to continue But thats itLast verse In the stillness I remember the scene I washome from a day in the woods with my father Sitting on thefloor with Prim who was just a toddler singing TheHanging Tree Making us necklaces out of scraps of oldrope like it said in the song not knowing the real meaningof the words The tune was simple and easy to harmonizeto though and back then I could memorize almost anythingset to music after a round or two Suddenly my mothersnatched the rope necklaces away and was yelling at myfather I started to cry because my mother never yelled andthen Prim was wailing and I ran outside to hide As I hadexactly one hiding spotin the Meadow under ahoneysuckle bushmy father found me immediately Hecalmed me down and told me everything was fine onlywed better not sing that song anymore My mother justwanted me to forget it So of course every word wasimmediately irrevocably branded into my brainWe didnt sing it anymore my father and I or evenspeak of it After he died it used to come back to me a lotBeing older I began to understand the lyrics At thebeginning it sounds like a guy is trying to get his girlfriendto secretly meet up with him at midnight But its an oddplace for a tryst a hanging tree where a man was hung formurder The murderers lover must have had something todo with the killing or maybe they were just going to punishher anyway because his corpse called out for her to fleeThats weird obviously the talkingcorpse bit but its notuntil the third verse that The Hanging Tree begins to getunnerving You realize the singer of the song is the deadmurderer Hes still in the hanging tree And even though hetold his lover to flee he keeps asking if shes coming tomeet him The phrase Where I told you to run so wed bothbe free is the most troubling because at first you think hestalking about when he told her to flee presumably to safetyBut then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him Todeath In the final stanza its clear that thats what heswaiting for His lover with her rope necklace hanging deadnext to him in the treeI used to think the murderer was the creepiest guyimaginable Now with a couple of trips to the HungerGames under my belt I decide not to judge him withoutknowing more details Maybe his lover was alreadysentenced to death and he was trying to make it easier Tolet her know hed be waiting Or maybe he thought the placehe was leaving her was really worse than death Didnt Iwant to kill Peeta with that syringe to save him from theCapitol Was that really my only option Probably not but Icouldnt think of another at the timeI guess my mother thought the whole thing was tootwisted for a sevenyearold though Especially one whomade her own rope necklaces It wasnt like hanging wassomething that only happened in a story Plenty of peoplewere executed that way in  You can bet she didnt wantme singing it in front of my music class She probablywouldnt like me doing it here for Pollux even but at leastIm notwait no Im wrong As I glance sideways I seeCastor has been taping me Everyone is watching meintently And Pollux has tears running down his cheeksbecause no doubt my freaky song has dredged up someterrible incident in his life Great I sigh and lean backagainst the trunk Thats when the mockingjays begin theirrendition of The Hanging Tree In their mouths its quitebeautiful Conscious of being filmed I stand quietly until Ihear Cressida call CutPlutarch crosses to me laughing Where do youcome up with this stuff No one would believe it if we madeit up He throws an arm around me and kisses me on thetop of my head with a loud smack Youre goldenI wasnt doing it for the cameras I sayLucky they were on then he says Come oneverybody back to townAs we trudge back through the woods we reach aboulder and both Gale and I turn our heads in the samedirection like a pair of dogs catching a scent on the windCressida notices and asks what lies that way We admitwithout acknowledging each other its our old huntingrendezvous place She wants to see it even after we tellher its nothing reallyNothing but a place where I was happy I thinkOur rock ledge overlooking the valley Perhaps a littleless green than usual but the blackberry bushes hangheavy with fruit Here began countless days of hunting andsnaring fishing and gathering roaming together throughthe woods unloading our thoughts while we filled our gamebags This was the doorway to both sustenance and sanityAnd we were each others keyTheres no District  to escape from now noPeacekeepers to trick no hungry mouths to feed TheCapitol took away all of that and Im on the verge of losingGale as well The glue of mutual need that bonded us sotightly together for all those years is melting away Darkpatches not light show in the spaces between us How canit be that today in the face of s horrible demise we aretoo angry to even speak to each otherGale as good as lied to me That was unacceptableeven if he was concerned about my wellbeing His apologyseemed genuine though And I threw it back in his facewith an insult to make sure it stung What is happening tous Why are we always at odds now Its all a muddle but Isomehow feel that if I went back to the root of our troublesmy actions would be at the heart of it Do I really want todrive him awayMy fingers encircle a blackberry and pluck it from itsstem I roll it gently between my thumb and forefingerSuddenly I turn to him and toss it in his direction And maythe odds I say I throw it high so he has plenty of time todecide whether to knock it aside or accept itGales eyes train on me not the berry but at the lastmoment he opens his mouth and catches it He chewsswallows and theres a long pause before he says beever in your favor But he does say itCressida has us sit in the nook in the rocks where itsimpossible not to be touching and coaxes us into talkingabout hunting What drove us out into the woods how wemet favorite moments We thaw begin to laugh a little aswe relate mishaps with bees and wild dogs and skunksWhen the conversation turns to how it felt to translate ourskill with weapons to the bombing in  I stop talking Galejust says Long overdueBy the time we reach the town square afternoonssinking into evening I take Cressida to the rubble of thebakery and ask her to film something The only emotion Ican muster is exhaustion Peeta this is your home Noneof your family has been heard of since the bombing Twelveis gone And youre calling for a ceasefire I look acrossthe emptiness Theres no one left to hear youAs we stand before the lump of metal that was thegallows Cressida asks if either of us has ever beentortured In answer Gale pulls off his shirt and turns hisback to the camera I stare at the lash marks and againhear the whistling of the whip see his bloody figure hangingunconscious by his wristsIm done I announce Ill meet you at the VictorsVillage Something formy motherI guess I walked here but the next thing Im consciousof is sitting on the floor in front of the kitchen cabinets of ourhouse in the Victors Village Meticulously lining ceramicjars and glass bottles into a box Placing clean cottonbandages between them to prevent breaking Wrappingbunches of dried flowersSuddenly I remember the rose on my dresser Was itreal If so is it still up there I have to resist the temptationto check If its there it will only frighten me all over again Ihurry with my packingWhen the cabinets are empty I rise to find that Galehas materialized in my kitchen Its disturbing howsoundlessly he can appear Hes leaning on the table hisfingers spread wide against the wood grain I set the boxbetween us Remember he asks This is where youkissed meSo the heavy dose of morphling administered after thewhipping wasnt enough to erase that from hisconsciousness I didnt think youd remember that I sayHave to be dead to forget Maybe even not then hetells me Maybe Ill be like that man in The Hanging TreeStill waiting for an answer Gale who I have never seencry has tears in his eyes To keep them from spilling over Ireach forward and press my lips against his We taste ofheat ashes and misery Its a surprising flavor for such agentle kiss He pulls away first and gives me a wry smile Iknew youd kiss meHow I say Because I didnt know myselfBecause Im in pain he says Thats the only way Iget your attention He picks up the box Dont worryKatniss Itll pass He leaves before I can answerIm too weary to work through his latest charge I spendthe short ride back to  curled up in a seat trying to ignorePlutarch going on about one of his favorite subjectsweapons mankind no longer has at its disposal Highflyingplanes military satellites cell disintegrators dronesbiological weapons with expiration dates Brought down bythe destruction of the atmosphere or lack of resources ormoral squeamishness You can hear the regret of a HeadGamemaker who can only dream of such toys who mustmake do with hovercraft and landtoland missiles and plainold gunsAfter dropping off my Mockingjay suit I go straight tobed without eating Even so Prim has to shake me to getme up in the morning After breakfast I ignore my scheduleand take a nap in the supply closet When I come tocrawling out from between the boxes of chalk and pencilsits dinnertime again I get an extralarge portion of peasoup and am headed back to Compartment E when Boggsintercepts meTheres a meeting in Command Disregard yourcurrent schedule he saysDone I sayDid you follow it at all today he asks inexasperationWho knows Im mentally disoriented I hold up mywrist to show my medical bracelet and realize its goneSee I cant even remember they took my bracelet Whydo they want me in Command Did I miss somethingI think Cressida wanted to show you the Twelvepropos But I guess youll see them when they air he saysThats what I need a schedule of When the proposair I say He shoots me a look but doesnt commentfurtherPeople have crowded into Command but theyvesaved me a seat between Finnick and Plutarch Thescreens are already up on the table showing the regularCapitol feedWhats going on Arent we seeing the Twelvepropos I askOh no says Plutarch I mean possibly I dont knowexactly what footage Beetee plans to useBeetee thinks hes found a way to break into the feednationwide says Finnick So that our propos will air in theCapitol too Hes down working on it in Special Defensenow Theres live programming tonight Snows making anappearance or something I think its startingThe Capitol seal appears underscored by the anthemThen Im staring directly into President Snows snake eyesas he greets the nation He seems barricaded behind hispodium but the white rose in his lapel is in full view Thecamera pulls back to include Peeta off to one side in frontof a projected map of Panem Hes sitting in an elevatedchair his shoes supported by a metal rung The foot of hisprosthetic leg taps out a strange irregular beat Beads ofsweat have broken through the layer of powder on hisupper lip and forehead But its the look in his eyesangryyet unfocusedthat frightens me the mostHes worse I whisper Finnick grasps my hand togive me an anchor and I try to hang onPeeta begins to speak in a frustrated tone about theneed for the ceasefire He highlights the damage done tokey infrastructure in various districts and as he speaksparts of the map light up showing images of thedestruction A broken dam in  A derailed train with a poolof toxic waste spilling from the tank cars A granarycollapsing after a fire All of these he attributes to rebelactionBam Without warning Im suddenly on televisionstanding in the rubble of the bakeryPlutarch jumps to his feet He did it Beetee broke inThe rooms buzzing with reaction when Peetas backdistracted He has seen me on the monitor He tries to pickup his speech by moving on to the bombing of a waterpurification plant when a clip of Finnick talking about Ruereplaces him And then the whole thing breaks down into abroadcast battle as the Capitol tech masters try to fend offBeetees attack But they are unprepared and Beeteeapparently anticipating he would not hold on to control hasan arsenal of five to tensecond clips to work with Wewatch the official presentation deteriorate as its pepperedwith choice shots from the proposPlutarchs in spasms of delight and most everybody ischeering Beetee on but Finnick remains still andspeechless beside me I meet Haymitchs eyes fromacross the room and see my own dread mirrored back Therecognition that with every cheer Peeta slips even fartherfrom our graspThe Capitol seals back up accompanied by a flataudio tone This lasts about twenty seconds before Snowand Peeta return The set is in turmoil Were hearing franticexchanges from their booth Snow plows forward sayingthat clearly the rebels are now attempting to disrupt thedissemination of information they find incriminating butboth truth and justice will reign The full broadcast willresume when security has been reinstated He asks Peetaif given tonights demonstration he has any partingthoughts for Katniss EverdeenAt the mention of my name Peetas face contorts ineffort Katnisshow do you think this will end What will beleft No one is safe Not in the Capitol Not in the districtsAnd youin Thirteen He inhales sharply as if fighting forair his eyes look insane Dead by morningOff camera Snow orders End it Beetee throws thewhole thing into chaos by flashing a still shot of me standingin front of the hospital at threesecond intervals Butbetween the images we are privy to the reallife actionbeing played out on the set Peetas attempt to continuespeaking The camera knocked down to record the whitetiled floor The scuffle of boots The impact of the blow thatsinseparable from Peetas cry of painAnd his blood as it splatters the tilesPART IITHE ASSAULTThe scream begins in my lower back and works itsway up through my body only to jam in my throat I am Avoxmute choking on my grief Even if I could release themuscles in my neck let the sound tear into space wouldanyone notice it The rooms in an uproar Questions anddemands ring out as they try to decipher Peetas wordsAnd youin Thirteendead by morning Yet no one isasking about the messenger whose blood has beenreplaced by staticA voice calls the others to attention Shut up Everypair of eyes falls on Haymitch Its not some big mysteryThe boys telling us were about to be attacked Here InThirteenHow would he have that informationWhy should we trust himHow do you knowHaymitch gives a growl of frustration Theyre beatinghim bloody while we speak What more do you needKatniss help me out hereI have to give myself a shake to free my wordsHaymitchs right I dont know where Peeta got theinformation Or if its true But he believes it is And theyre I cant say aloud what Snows doing to himYou dont know him Haymitch says to Coin We doGet your people readyThe president doesnt seem alarmed only somewhatperplexed by this turn in events She mulls over the wordstapping one finger lightly on the rim of the control board infront of her When she speaks she addresses Haymitch inan even voice Of course we have prepared for such ascenario Although we have decades of support for theassumption that further direct attacks on Thirteen would becounterproductive to the Capitols cause Nuclear missileswould release radiation into the atmosphere withincalculable environmental results Even routine bombingcould badly damage our military compound which we knowthey hope to regain And of course they invite acounterstrike It is conceivable that given our currentalliance with the rebels those would be viewed asacceptable risksYou think so says Haymitch Its a shade toosincere but the subtleties of irony are often wasted in I do At any rate were overdue for a Level Fivesecurity drill says Coin Lets proceed with the lockdownShe begins to type rapidly on her keyboard authorizing herdecision The moment she raises her head it beginsThere have been two lowlevel drills since I arrived in I dont remember much about the first I was in intensivecare in the hospital and I think the patients were exemptedas the complications of removing us for a practice drilloutweighed the benefits I was vaguely aware of amechanical voice instructing people to congregate in yellowzones During the second a Level Two drill meant for minorcrisessuch as a temporary quarantine while citizens weretested for contagion during a flu outbreakwe weresupposed to return to our living quarters I stayed behind apipe in the laundry room ignored the pulsating beepscoming over the audio system and watched a spiderconstruct a web Neither experience has prepared me forthe wordless eardrumpiercing fearinducing sirens thatnow permeate  There would be no disregarding thissound which seems designed to throw the wholepopulation into a frenzy But this is  and that doesnthappenBoggs guides Finnick and me out of Command alongthe hall to a doorway and onto a wide stairway Streams ofpeople are converging to form a river that flows onlydownward No one shrieks or tries to push ahead Even thechildren dont resist We descend flight after flightspeechless because no word could be heard above thissound I look for my mother and Prim but its impossible tosee anyone but those immediately around me Theyre bothworking in the hospital tonight though so theres no waythey can miss the drillMy ears pop and my eyes feel heavy We are coalminedeep The only plus is that the farther we retreat intothe earth the less shrill the sirens become Its as if theywere meant to physically drive us away from the surfacewhich I suppose they are Groups of people begin to peeloff into marked doorways and still Boggs directs medownward until finally the stairs end at the edge of anenormous cavern I start to walk straight in and Boggsstops me shows me that I must wave my schedule in frontof a scanner so that Im accounted for No doubt theinformations going to some computer somewhere to makesure no ones gone astrayThe place seems unable to decide if its natural ormanmade Certain areas of the walls are stone while steelbeams and concrete heavily reinforce others Sleepingbunks are hewn right into the rock walls Theres a kitchenbathrooms a firstaid station This place was designed foran extended stayWhite signs with letters or numbers are placed atintervals around the cavern As Boggs tells Finnick and meto report to the area that matches our assigned quartersinmy case E for Compartment EPlutarch strolls up Ahhere you are he says Recent events have had little effecton Plutarchs mood He still has a happy glow fromBeetees success on the Airtime Assault Eyes on theforest not on the trees Not on Peetas punishment or simminent blasting Katniss obviously this is a bad momentfor you what with Peetas setback but you need to beaware that others will be watching youWhat I say I cant believe he actually justdowngraded Peetas dire circumstances to a setbackThe other people in the bunker theyll be taking theircue on how to react from you If youre calm and braveothers will try to be as well If you panic it could spread likewildfire explains Plutarch I just stare at him Fire iscatching so to speak he continues as if Im being slow onthe uptakeWhy dont I just pretend Im on camera Plutarch IsayYes Perfect One is always much braver with anaudience he says Look at the courage Peeta justdisplayedIts all I can do not to slap himIve got to get back to Coin before lockdown Youkeep up the good work he says and then heads offI cross to the big letter E posted on the wall Our spaceconsists of a twelvebytwelvefoot square of stone floordelineated by painted lines Carved into the wall are twobunksone of us will be sleeping on the floorand agroundlevel cube space for storage A piece of whitepaper coated in clear plastic reads BUNKER PROTOCOL Istare fixedly at the little black specks on the sheet For awhile theyre obscured by the residual blood droplets that Icant seem to wipe from my vision Slowly the words comeinto focus The first section is entitled On Arrival Make sure all members of your Compartment areaccounted forMy mother and Prim havent arrived but I was one ofthe first people to reach the bunker Both of them areprobably helping to relocate hospital patients Go to the Supply Station and secure one pack foreach member of your Compartment Ready yourLiving Area Return packsI scan the cavern until I locate the Supply Station adeep room set off by a counter People wait behind it buttheres not a lot of activity there yet I walk over give ourcompartment letter and request three packs A manchecks a sheet pulls the specified packs from shelvingand swings them up onto the counter After sliding one onmy back and getting a grip on the other two with my hands Iturn to find a group rapidly forming behind me Excuseme I say as I carry my supplies through the others Is it amatter of timing Or is Plutarch right Are these peoplemodeling their behavior on mineBack at our space I open one of the packs to find athin mattress bedding two sets of gray clothing atoothbrush a comb and a flashlight On examining thecontents of the other packs I find the only discernibledifference is that they contain both gray and white outfitsThe latter will be for my mother and Prim in case they havemedical duties After I make up the beds store the clothesand return the backpacks Ive got nothing to do but observethe last rule Await further instructionsI sit crosslegged on the floor to await A steady flow ofpeople begins to fill the room claiming spaces collectingsupplies It wont take long until the place is full up I wonderif my mother and Prim are going to stay the night atwherever the hospital patients have been taken But no Idont think so They were on the list here Im starting to getanxious when my mother appears I look behind her into asea of strangers Wheres Prim I askIsnt she here she replies She was supposed tocome straight down from the hospital She left ten minutesbefore I did Where is she Where could she have goneI squeeze my lids shut tight for a moment to track heras I would prey on a hunt See her react to the sirens rushto help the patients nod as they gesture for her to descendto the bunker and then hesitate with her on the stairs Tornfor a moment But whyMy eyes fly open The cat She went back for himOh no my mother says We both know Im rightWere pushing against the incoming tide trying to get out ofthe bunker Up ahead I can see them preparing to shut thethick metal doors Slowly rotating the metal wheels oneither side inward Somehow I know that once they havebeen sealed nothing in the world will convince the soldiersto open them Perhaps it will even be beyond their controlIm indiscriminately shoving people aside as I shout forthem to wait The space between the doors shrinks to ayard a foot there are only a few inches left when I jam myhand through the crackOpen it Let me out I cryConsternation shows on the soldiers faces as theyreverse the wheels a bit Not enough to let me pass butenough to avoid crushing my fingers I take the opportunityto wedge my shoulder into the opening Prim I holler upthe stairs My mother pleads with the guards as I try towriggle my way out PrimThen I hear it The faint sound of footsteps on thestairs Were coming I hear my sister callHold the door That was GaleTheyre coming I tell the guards and they slide thedoors open about a foot But I dont dare moveafraidtheyll lock us all outuntil Prim appears her cheeks flushedwith running hauling Buttercup I pull her inside and Galefollows twisting an armload of baggage sideways to get itinto the bunker The doors are closed with a loud and finalclankWhat were you thinking I give Prim an angry shakeand then hug her squashing Buttercup between usPrims explanation is already on her lips I couldntleave him behind Katniss Not twice You should have seenhim pacing the room and howling Hed come back toprotect usOkay Okay I take a few breaths to calm myself stepback and lift Buttercup by the scruff of the neck I shouldvedrowned you when I had the chance His ears flatten andhe raises a paw I hiss before he gets a chance whichseems to annoy him a little since he considers hissing hisown personal sound of contempt In retaliation he gives ahelpless kitten mew that brings my sister immediately to hisdefenseOh Katniss dont tease him she says folding himback in her arms Hes already so upsetThe idea that Ive wounded the brutes tiny cat feelingsjust invites further taunting But Prims genuinely distressedfor him So instead I visualize Buttercups fur lining a pair ofgloves an image that has helped me deal with him over theyears Okay sorry Were under the big E on the wallBetter get him settled in before he loses it Prim hurriesoff and I find myself facetoface with Gale Hes holding thebox of medical supplies from our kitchen in  Site of ourlast conversation kiss fallout whatever My game bagsslung across his shoulderIf Peetas right these didnt stand a chance he saysPeeta Blood like raindrops on the window Like wetmud on bootsThanks foreverything I take our stuff What wereyou doing up in our roomsJust doublechecking he says Were in FortySeven if you need mePractically everyone withdrew to their spaces when thedoors shut so I get to cross to our new home with at leastfive hundred people watching me I try to appear extra calmto make up for my frantic crashing through the crowd Likethats fooling anyone So much for setting an example Ohwho cares They all think Im nuts anyway One man who Ithink I knocked to the floor catches my eye and rubs hiselbow resentfully I almost hiss at him tooPrim has Buttercup installed on the lower bunk drapedin a blanket so that only his face pokes out This is how helikes to be when theres thunder the one thing that actuallyfrightens him My mother puts her box carefully in the cube Icrouch my back supported by the wall to check what Galemanaged to rescue in my hunting bag The plant book thehunting jacket my parents wedding photo and thepersonal contents of my drawer My mockingjay pin nowlives with Cinnas outfit but theres the gold locket and thesilver parachute with the spile and Peetas pearl I knot thepearl into the corner of the parachute bury it deep in therecesses of the bag as if its Peetas life and no one cantake it away as long as I guard itThe faint sound of the sirens cuts off sharply Coinsvoice comes over the district audio system thanking us allfor an exemplary evacuation of the upper levels Shestresses that this is not a drill as Peeta Mellark the District victor has possibly made a televised reference to anattack on  tonightThats when the first bomb hits Theres an initial senseof impact followed by an explosion that resonates in myinnermost parts the lining of my intestines the marrow ofmy bones the roots of my teeth Were all going to die Ithink My eyes turn upward expecting to see giant cracksrace across the ceiling massive chunks of stone rainingdown on us but the bunker itself gives only a slight shudderThe lights go out and I experience the disorientation of totaldarkness Speechless human soundsspontaneousshrieks ragged breaths baby whimpers one musical bit ofinsane laughterdance around in the charged air Thentheres a hum of a generator and a dim wavering glowreplaces the stark lighting that is the norm in  Its closerto what we had in our homes in  when the candles andfire burned low on a winters nightI reach for Prim in the twilight clamp my hand on herleg and pull myself over to her Her voice remains steadyas she croons to Buttercup Its all right baby its all rightWell be okay down hereMy mother wraps her arms around us I allow myself tofeel young for a moment and rest my head on her shoulderThat was nothing like the bombs in Eight I sayProbably a bunker missile says Prim keeping hervoice soothing for the cats sake We learned about themduring the orientation for new citizens Theyre designed topenetrate deep in the ground before they go off Becausetheres no point in bombing Thirteen on the surfaceanymoreNuclear I ask feeling a chill run through meNot necessarily says Prim Some just have a lot ofexplosives in them Butit could be either kind I guessThe gloom makes it hard to see the heavy metal doorsat the end of the bunker Would they be any protectionagainst a nuclear attack And even if they were onehundred percent effective at sealing out the radiation whichis really unlikely would we ever be able to leave this placeThe thought of spending whatever remains of my life in thisstone vault horrifies me I want to run madly for the door anddemand to be released into whatever lies above Itspointless They would never let me out and I might startsome kind of stampedeWere so far down Im sure were safe says mymother wanly Is she thinking of my fathers being blown tonothingness in the mines It was a close call thoughThank goodness Peeta had the wherewithal to warn usThe wherewithal A general term that somehowincludes everything that was needed for him to sound thealarm The knowledge the opportunity the courage Andsomething else I cant define Peeta seemed to have beenwaging a sort of battle in his mind fighting to get themessage out Why The ease with which he manipulateswords is his greatest talent Was his difficulty a result of historture Something more Like madnessCoins voice perhaps a shade grimmer fills thebunker the volume level flickering with the lightsApparently Peeta Mellarks information was sound and weowe him a great debt of gratitude Sensors indicate the firstmissile was not nuclear but very powerful We expect morewill follow For the duration of the attack citizens are to stayin their assigned areas unless otherwise notifiedA soldier alerts my mother that shes needed in thefirstaid station Shes reluctant to leave us even thoughshell only be thirty yards awayWell be fine really I tell her Do you think anythingcould get past him I point to Buttercup who gives mesuch a halfhearted hiss we all have to laugh a little Even Ifeel sorry for him After my mother goes I suggest Whydont you climb in with him PrimI know its sillybut Im afraid the bunk might collapseon us during the attack she saysIf the bunks collapse the whole bunker will have givenway and buried us but I decide this kind of logic wontactually be helpful Instead I clean out the storage cube andmake Buttercup a bed inside Then I pull a mattress in frontof it for my sister and me to shareWere given clearance in small groups to use thebathroom and brush our teeth although showering hasbeen canceled for the day I curl up with Prim on themattress double layering the blankets because the cavernemits a dank chill Buttercup miserable even with Primsconstant attention huddles in the cube and exhales catbreath in my faceDespite the disagreeable conditions Im glad to havetime with my sister My extreme preoccupation since Icame hereno since the first Games reallyhas left littleattention for her I havent been watching over her the way Ishould the way I used to After all it was Gale who checkedour compartment not me Something to make up forI realize Ive never even bothered to ask her about howshes handling the shock of coming here So how are youliking Thirteen Prim I offerRight now she asks We both laugh I miss homebadly sometimes But then I remember theres nothing leftto miss anymore I feel safer here We dont have to worryabout you Well not the same way She pauses and thena shy smile crosses her lips I think theyre going to trainme to be a doctorIts the first Ive heard of it Well of course they areTheyd be stupid not toTheyve been watching me when I help out in thehospital Im already taking the medic courses Its justbeginners stuff I know a lot of it from home Still theresplenty to learn she tells meThats great I say Prim a doctor She couldnt evendream of it in  Something small and quiet like a matchbeing struck lights up the gloom inside me This is the sortof future a rebellion could bringWhat about you Katniss How are you managingHer fingertip moves in short gentle strokes betweenButtercups eyes And dont say youre fineIts true Whatever the opposite of fine is thats what Iam So I go ahead and tell her about Peeta hisdeterioration onscreen and how I think they must be killinghim at this very moment Buttercup has to rely on himself fora while because now Prim turns her attention to me Pullingme closer brushing the hair back behind my ears with herfingers Ive stopped talking because theres really nothingleft to say and theres this piercing sort of pain where myheart is Maybe Im even having a heart attack but it doesntseem worth mentioningKatniss I dont think President Snow will kill Peetashe says Of course she says this its what she thinks willcalm me But her next words come as a surprise If hedoes he wont have anyone left you want He wont haveany way to hurt youSuddenly I am reminded of another girl one who hadseen all the evil the Capitol had to offer Johanna Masonthe tribute from District  in the last arena I was trying toprevent her from going into the jungle where the jabberjaysmimicked the voices of loved ones being tortured but shebrushed me off saying They cant hurt me Im not likethe rest of you Theres no one left I loveThen I know Prim is right that Snow cannot afford towaste Peetas life especially now while the Mockingjaycauses so much havoc Hes killed Cinna alreadyDestroyed my home My family Gale and even Haymitchare out of his reach Peetas all he has leftSo what do you think theyll do to him I askPrim sounds about a thousand years old when shespeaksWhatever it takes to break youWhat will break meThis is the question that consumes me over the nextthree days as we wait to be released from our prison ofsafety What will break me into a million pieces so that I ambeyond repair beyond usefulness I mention it to no onebut it devours my waking hours and weaves itselfthroughout my nightmaresFour more bunker missiles fall over this period allmassive all very damaging but theres no urgency to theattack The bombs are spread out over the long hours sothat just when you think the raid is over another blast sendsshock waves through your guts It feels more designed tokeep us in lockdown than to decimate  Cripple thedistrict yes Give the people plenty to do to get the placerunning again But destroy it No Coin was right on thatpoint You dont destroy what you want to acquire in thefuture I assume what they really want in the short term is tostop the Airtime Assaults and keep me off the televisions ofPanemWe receive next to no information about what ishappening Our screens never come on and we get onlybrief audio updates from Coin about the nature of thebombs Certainly the war is still being waged but as to itsstatus were in the darkInside the bunker cooperation is the order of the dayWe adhere to a strict schedule for meals and bathingexercise and sleep Small periods of socialization aregranted to alleviate the tedium Our space becomes verypopular because both children and adults have afascination with Buttercup He attains celebrity status withhis evening game of Crazy Cat I created this by accident afew years ago during a winter blackout You simply wigglea flashlight beam around on the floor and Buttercup tries tocatch it Im petty enough to enjoy it because I think it makeshim look stupid Inexplicably everyone here thinks hesclever and delightful Im even issued a special set ofbatteriesan enormous wasteto be used for this purposeThe citizens of  are truly starved for entertainmentIts on the third night during our game that I answer thequestion eating away at me Crazy Cat becomes ametaphor for my situation I am Buttercup Peeta the thing Iwant so badly to secure is the light As long as Buttercupfeels he has the chance of catching the elusive light underhis paws hes bristling with aggression Thats how Ivebeen since I left the arena with Peeta alive When the lightgoes out completely Buttercups temporarily distraught andconfused but he recovers and moves on to other thingsThats what would happen if Peeta died But the one thingthat sends Buttercup into a tailspin is when I leave the lighton but put it hopelessly out of his reach high on the wallbeyond even his jumping skills He paces below the wallwails and cant be comforted or distracted Hes uselessuntil I shut the light off Thats what Snow is trying to do tome now only I dont know what form his game takesMaybe this realization on my part is all Snow needsThinking that Peeta was in his possession and beingtortured for rebel information was bad But thinking that hesbeing tortured specifically to incapacitate me isunendurable And its under the weight of this revelation thatI truly begin to breakAfter Crazy Cat were directed to bed The powersbeen coming and going sometimes the lamps burn at fullbrightness other times we squint at one another in thebrownouts At bedtime they turn the lamps to near darknessand activate safety lights in each space Prim whosdecided the walls will hold up snuggles with Buttercup onthe lower bunk My mothers on the upper I offer to take abunk but they make me keep to the floor mattress since Iflail around so much when Im sleepingIm not flailing now as my muscles are rigid with thetension of holding myself together The pain over my heartreturns and from it I imagine tiny fissures spreading out intomy body Through my torso down my arms and legs overmy face leaving it crisscrossed with cracks One good joltof a bunker missile and I could shatter into strange razorsharpshardsWhen the restless wiggling majority has settled intosleep I carefully extricate myself from my blanket and tiptoethrough the cavern until I find Finnick feeling for someunspecified reason that he will understand He sits underthe safety light in his space knotting his rope not evenpretending to rest As I whisper my discovery of Snowsplan to break me it dawns on me This strategy is very oldnews to Finnick Its what broke himThis is what theyre doing to you with Annie isnt it IaskWell they didnt arrest her because they thought shedbe a wealth of rebel information he says They know Idnever have risked telling her anything like that For her ownprotectionOh Finnick Im so sorry I sayNo Im sorry That I didnt warn you somehow he tellsmeSuddenly a memory surfaces Im strapped to my bedmad with rage and grief after the rescue Finnick is trying toconsole me about Peeta Theyll figure out he doesntknow anything pretty fast And they wont kill him if theythink they can use him against youYou did warn me though On the hovercraft Onlywhen you said theyd use Peeta against me I thought youmeant like bait To lure me into the Capitol somehow IsayI shouldnt have said even that It was too late for it tobe of any help to you Since I hadnt warned you before theQuarter Quell I shouldve shut up about how Snowoperates Finnick yanks on the end of his rope and anintricate knot becomes a straight line again Its just that Ididnt understand when I met you After your first Games Ithought the whole romance was an act on your part We allexpected youd continue that strategy But it wasnt untilPeeta hit the force field and nearly died that I FinnickhesitatesI think back to the arena How I sobbed when Finnickrevived Peeta The quizzical look on Finnicks face Theway he excused my behavior blaming it on my pretendpregnancy That you whatThat I knew Id misjudged you That you do love himIm not saying in what way Maybe you dont know yourselfBut anyone paying attention could see how much you careabout him he says gentlyAnyone On Snows visit before the Victory Tour hechallenged me to erase any doubts of my love for PeetaConvince me Snow said It seems under that hot pinksky with Peetas life in limbo I finally did And in doing so Igave him the weapon he needed to break meFinnick and I sit for a long time in silence watching theknots bloom and vanish before I can ask How do youbear itFinnick looks at me in disbelief I dont KatnissObviously I dont I drag myself out of nightmares eachmorning and find theres no relief in waking Something inmy expression stops him Better not to give in to it It takesten times as long to put yourself back together as it does tofall apartWell he must know I take a deep breath forcingmyself back into one pieceThe more you can distract yourself the better hesays First thing tomorrow well get you your own ropeUntil then take mineI spend the rest of the night on my mattressobsessively making knots holding them up for Buttercupsinspection If one looks suspicious he swipes it out of theair and bites it a few times to make sure its dead Bymorning my fingers are sore but Im still holding onWith twentyfour hours of quiet behind us Coin finallyannounces we can leave the bunker Our old quarters havebeen destroyed by the bombings Everyone must followexact directions to their new compartments We clean ourspaces as directed and file obediently toward the doorBefore Im halfway there Boggs appears and pulls mefrom the line He signals for Gale and Finnick to join usPeople move aside to let us by Some even smile at mesince the Crazy Cat game seems to have made me morelovable Out the door up the stairs down the hall to one ofthose multidirectional elevators and finally we arrive atSpecial Defense Nothing along our route has beendamaged but we are still very deepBoggs ushers us into a room virtually identical toCommand Coin Plutarch Haymitch Cressida andeverybody else around the table looks exhaustedSomeone has finally broken out the coffeealthough Imsure its viewed only as an emergency stimulantandPlutarch has both hands wrapped tightly around his cup asif at any moment it might be taken awayTheres no small talk We need all four of you suitedup and aboveground says the president You have twohours to get footage showing the damage from thebombing establish that Thirteens military unit remains notonly functional but dominant and most important that theMockingjay is still alive Any questionsCan we have a coffee asks FinnickSteaming cups are handed out I stare distastefully atthe shiny black liquid never having been much of a fan ofthe stuff but thinking it might help me stay on my feetFinnick sloshes some cream in my cup and reaches intothe sugar bowl Want a sugar cube he asks in his oldseductive voice Thats how we met with Finnick offeringme sugar Surrounded by horses and chariots costumedand painted for the crowds before we were allies Before Ihad any idea what made him tick The memory actuallycoaxes a smile out of me Here it improves the taste hesays in his real voice plunking three cubes in my cupAs I turn to go suit up as the Mockingjay I catch Galewatching me and Finnick unhappily What now Does heactually think somethings going on between us Maybe hesaw me go to Finnicks last night I wouldve passed theHawthornes space to get there I guess that probablyrubbed him the wrong way Me seeking out Finnickscompany instead of his Well fine Ive got rope burn on myfingers I can barely hold my eyes open and a cameracrews waiting for me to do something brilliant And Snowsgot Peeta Gale can think whatever he wantsIn my new Remake Room in Special Defense my prepteam slaps me into my Mockingjay suit arranges my hairand applies minimal makeup before my coffees evencooled In ten minutes the cast and crew of the next proposare making the circuitous trek to the outside I slurp mycoffee as we travel finding that the cream and sugar greatlyenhance its flavor As I knock back the dregs that havesettled to the bottom of the cup I feel a slight buzz start torun through my veinsAfter climbing a final ladder Boggs hits a lever thatopens a trapdoor Fresh air rushes in I take big gulps andfor the first time allow myself to feel how much I hated thebunker We emerge into the woods and my hands runthrough the leaves overhead Some are just starting to turnWhat day is it I ask no one in particular Boggs tells meSeptember begins next weekSeptember That means Snow has had Peeta in hisclutches for five maybe six weeks I examine a leaf on mypalm and see Im shaking I cant will myself to stop I blamethe coffee and try to focus on slowing my breathing whichis far too rapid for my paceDebris begins to litter the forest floor We come to ourfirst crater thirty yards wide and I cant tell how deep VeryBoggs says anyone on the first ten levels would likely havebeen killed We skirt the pit and continue onCan you rebuild it Gale asksNot anytime soon That one didnt get much A fewbackup generators and a poultry farm says Boggs Welljust seal it offThe trees disappear as we enter the area inside thefence The craters are ringed with a mixture of old and newrubble Before the bombing very little of the current  wasaboveground A few guard stations The training areaAbout a foot of the top floor of our buildingwhereButtercups window jutted outwith several feet of steel ontop of it Even that was never meant to withstand more thana superficial attackHow much of an edge did the boys warning giveyou asks HaymitchAbout ten minutes before our own systems wouldvedetected the missiles says BoggsBut it did help right I ask I cant bear it if he saysnoAbsolutely Boggs replies Civilian evacuation wascompleted Seconds count when youre under attack Tenminutes meant lives savedPrim I think And Gale They were in the bunker only acouple of minutes before the first missile hit Peeta mighthave saved them Add their names to the list of things I cannever stop owing him forCressida has the idea to film me in front of the ruins ofthe old Justice Building which is something of a joke sincethe Capitols been using it as a backdrop for fake newsbroadcasts for years to show that the district no longerexisted Now with the recent attack the Justice Buildingsits about ten yards away from the edge of a new craterAs we approach what used to be the grand entranceGale points out something and the whole party slows downI dont know what the problem is at first and then I see theground strewn with fresh pink and red roses Dont touchthem I yell Theyre for meThe sickeningly sweet smell hits my nose and myheart begins to hammer against my chest So I didntimagine it The rose on my dresser Before me lies Snowssecond delivery Longstemmed pink and red beauties thevery flowers that decorated the set where Peeta and Iperformed our postvictory interview Flowers not meant forone but for a pair of loversI explain to the others as best I can Upon inspectionthey appear to be harmless if genetically enhancedflowers Two dozen roses Slightly wilted Most likelydropped after the last bombing A crew in special suitscollects them and carts them away I feel certain they willfind nothing extraordinary in them though Snow knowsexactly what hes doing to me Its like having Cinna beatento a pulp while I watch from my tribute tube Designed tounhinge meLike then I try to rally and fight back But as Cressidagets Castor and Pollux in place I feel my anxiety buildingIm so tired so wired and so unable to keep my mind onanything but Peeta since Ive seen the roses The coffeewas a huge mistake What I didnt need was a stimulant Mybody visibly shakes and I cant seem to catch my breathAfter days in the bunker Im squinting no matter whatdirection I turn and the light hurts Even in the cool breezesweat trickles down my faceSo what exactly do you need from me again I askJust a few quick lines that show youre alive and stillfighting says CressidaOkay I take my position and then Im staring into thered light Staring Staring Im sorry Ive got nothingCressida walks up to me You feeling okay I nodShe pulls a small cloth from her pocket and blots my faceHow about we do the old QandA thingYeah That would help I think I cross my arms to hidethe shaking Glance at Finnick who gives me a thumbsupBut hes looking pretty shaky himselfCressidas back in position now So Katniss Youvesurvived the Capitol bombing of Thirteen How did itcompare with what you experienced on the ground inEightWe were so far underground this time there was noreal danger Thirteens alive and well and so am My voicecuts off in a dry squeaking soundTry the line again says Cressida Thirteens aliveand well and so am II take a breath trying to force air down into mydiaphragm Thirteens alive and so No thats wrongI swear I can still smell those rosesKatniss just this one line and youre done today Ipromise says Cressida Thirteens alive and well and soam II swing my arms to loosen myself up Place my fists onmy hips Then drop them to my sides Salivas filling mymouth at a ridiculous rate and I feel vomit at the back of mythroat I swallow hard and open my lips so I can get thestupid line out and go hide in the woods andthats when Istart cryingIts impossible to be the Mockingjay Impossible tocomplete even this one sentence Because now I know thateverything I say will be directly taken out on Peeta Result inhis torture But not his death no nothing so merciful as thatSnow will ensure that his life is much worse than deathCut I hear Cressida say quietlyWhats wrong with her Plutarch says under hisbreathShes figured out how Snows using Peeta saysFinnickTheres something like a collective sigh of regret fromthe semicircle of people spread out before me Because Iknow this now Because there will never be a way for me tonot know this again Because beyond the militarydisadvantage losing a Mockingjay entails I am brokenSeveral sets of arms would embrace me But in theend the only person I truly want to comfort me is Haymitchbecause he loves Peeta too I reach out for him and saysomething like his name and hes there holding me andpatting my back Its okay Itll be okay sweetheart He sitsme on a length of broken marble pillar and keeps an armaround me while I sobI cant do this anymore I sayI know he saysAll I can think of iswhat hes going to do to Peetabecause Im the Mockingjay I get outI know Haymitchs arm tightens around meDid you see How weird he acted What are theydoing to him Im gasping for air between sobs but Imanage one last phrase Its my fault And then I crosssome line into hysteria and theres a needle in my arm andthe world slips awayIt must be strong whatever they shot into me becauseits a full day before I come to My sleep wasnt peacefulthough I have the sense of emerging from a world of darkhaunted places where I traveled alone Haymitch sits in thechair by my bed his skin waxen his eyes bloodshot Iremember about Peeta and start to tremble againHaymitch reaches out and squeezes my shoulder Itsall right Were going to try to get Peeta outWhat That makes no sensePlutarchs sending in a rescue team He has peopleon the inside He thinks we can get Peeta back alive hesaysWhy didnt we before I sayBecause its costly But everyone agrees this is thething to do Its the same choice we made in the arena Todo whatever it takes to keep you going We cant lose theMockingjay now And you cant perform unless you knowSnow cant take it out on Peeta Haymitch offers me a cupHere drink somethingI slowly sit up and take a sip of water What do youmean costlyHe shrugs Covers will be blown People may die Butkeep in mind that theyre dying every day And its not justPeeta were getting Annie out for Finnick tooWhere is he I askBehind that screen sleeping his sedative off He lostit right after we knocked you out says Haymitch I smile alittle feel a bit less weak Yeah it was a really excellentshoot You two cracked up and Boggs left to arrange themission to get Peeta Were officially in rerunsWell if Boggs is leading it thats a plus I sayOh hes on top of it It was volunteer only but hepretended not to notice me waving my hand in the air saysHaymitch See Hes already demonstrated goodjudgmentSomethings wrong Haymitchs trying a little too hardto cheer me up Its not really his style So who elsevolunteeredI think there were seven altogether he saysevasivelyI get a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach Who elseHaymitch I insistHaymitch finally drops the goodnatured act Youknow who else Katniss You know who stepped up firstOf course I doGaleToday I might lose both of themI try to imagine a world where both Gales and Peetasvoices have ceased Hands stilled Eyes unblinking Imstanding over their bodies having a last look leaving theroom where they lie But when I open the door to step outinto the world theres only a tremendous void A pale graynothingness that is all my future holdsDo you want me to have them sedate you until itsover asks Haymitch Hes not joking This is a man whospent his adult life at the bottom of a bottle trying toanesthetize himself against the Capitols crimes Thesixteenyearold boy who won the second Quarter Quellmust have had people he lovedfamily friends asweetheart maybethat he fought to get back to Where arethey now How is it that until Peeta and I were thrust uponhim there was no one at all in his life What did Snow do tothemNo I say I want to go to the Capitol I want to be partof the rescue missionTheyre gone says HaymitchHow long ago did they leave I could catch up I could What What could I doHaymitch shakes his head Itll never happen Youretoo valuable and too vulnerable There was talk of sendingyou to another district to divert the Capitols attention whilethe rescue takes place But no one felt you could handle itPlease Haymitch Im begging now I have to dosomething I cant just sit here waiting to hear if they diedThere must be something I can doAll right Let me talk to Plutarch You stay put But Icant Haymitchs footsteps are still echoing in the outer hallwhen I fumble my way through the slit in the dividing curtainto find Finnick sprawled out on his stomach his handstwisted in his pillowcase Although its cowardlycruel evento rouse him from the shadowy muted drug land to starkreality I go ahead and do it because I cant stand to facethis by myselfAs I explain our situation his initial agitationmysteriously ebbs Dont you see Katniss this will decidethings One way or the other By the end of the day theylleither be dead or with us Itsits more than we could hopeforWell thats a sunny view of our situation And yettheres something calming about the idea that this tormentcould come to an endThe curtain yanks back and theres Haymitch He has ajob for us if we can pull it together They still need postbombingfootage of  If we can get it in the next fewhours Beetee can air it leading up to the rescue andmaybe keep the Capitols attention elsewhereYes a distraction says Finnick A decoy of sortsWhat we really need is something so riveting thateven President Snow wont be able to tear himself awayGot anything like that asks HaymitchHaving a job that might help the mission snaps me intofocus While I knock down breakfast and get prepped I tryto think of what I might say President Snow must bewondering how that bloodsplattered floor and his roses areaffecting me If he wants me broken then I will have to bewhole But I dont think I will convince him of anything byshouting a couple of defiant lines at the camera Besidesthat wont buy the rescue team any time Outbursts areshort Its stories that take timeI dont know if it will work but when the televisioncrews all assembled aboveground I ask Cressida if shecould start out by asking me about Peeta I take a seat onthe fallen marble pillar where I had my breakdown wait forthe red light and Cressidas questionHow did you meet Peeta she asksAnd then I do the thing that Haymitch has wanted sincemy first interview I open up When I met Peeta I waseleven years old and I was almost dead I talk about thatawful day when I tried to sell the baby clothes in the rainhow Peetas mother chased me from the bakery door andhow he took a beating to bring me the loaves of bread thatsaved our lives We had never even spoken The first timeI ever talked to Peeta was on the train to the GamesBut he was already in love with you says CressidaI guess so I allow myself a small smileHow are you doing with the separation she asksNot well I know at any moment Snow could kill himEspecially since he warned Thirteen about the bombing Itsa terrible thing to live with I say But because of whattheyre putting him through I dont have any reservationsanymore About doing whatever it takes to destroy theCapitol Im finally free I turn my gaze skyward and watchthe flight of a hawk across the sky President Snow onceadmitted to me that the Capitol was fragile At the time Ididnt know what he meant It was hard to see clearlybecause I was so afraid Now Im not The Capitols fragilebecause it depends on the districts for everything Foodenergy even the Peacekeepers that police us If wedeclare our freedom the Capitol collapses PresidentSnow thanks to you Im officially declaring mine todayIve been sufficient if not dazzling Everyone loves thebread story But its my message to President Snow thatgets the wheels spinning in Plutarchs brain He hastily callsFinnick and Haymitch over and they have a brief but intenseconversation that I can see Haymitch isnt happy withPlutarch seems to winFinnicks pale but nodding his headby the end of itAs Finnick moves to take my seat before the cameraHaymitch tells him You dont have to do thisYes I do If it will help her Finnick balls up his rope inhis hand Im readyI dont know what to expect A love story about AnnieAn account of the abuses in District  But Finnick Odairtakes a completely different tackPresident Snow used tosell memy body that isFinnick begins in a flat removed tone I wasnt the onlyone If a victor is considered desirable the president givesthem as a reward or allows people to buy them for anexorbitant amount of money If you refuse he kills someoneyou love So you do itThat explains it then Finnicks parade of lovers in theCapitol They were never real lovers Just people like ourold Head Peacekeeper Cray who bought desperate girlsto devour and discard because he could I want to interruptthe taping and beg Finnicks forgiveness for every falsethought Ive ever had about him But we have a job to doand I sense Finnicks role will be far more effective thanmineI wasnt the only one but I was the most popular hesays And perhaps the most defenseless because thepeople I loved were so defenseless To make themselvesfeel better my patrons would make presents of money orjewelry but I found a much more valuable form of paymentSecrets I think Thats what Finnick told me his loverspaid him in only I thought the whole arrangement was byhis choiceSecrets he says echoing my thoughts And this iswhere youre going to want to stay tuned President Snowbecause so very many of them were about you But letsbegin with some of the othersFinnick begins to weave a tapestry so rich in detail thatyou cant doubt its authenticity Tales of strange sexualappetites betrayals of the heart bottomless greed andbloody power plays Drunken secrets whispered over damppillowcases in the dead of night Finnick was someonebought and sold A district slave A handsome onecertainly but in reality harmless Who would he tell Andwho would believe him if he did But some secrets are toodelicious not to share I dont know the people Finnicknamesall seem to be prominent Capitol citizensbut Iknow from listening to the chatter of my prep team theattention the most mild slip in judgment can draw If a badhaircut can lead to hours of gossip what will charges ofincest backstabbing blackmail and arson produce Evenas the waves of shock and recrimination roll over theCapitol the people there will be waiting as I am now tohear about the presidentAnd now on to our good President CoriolanusSnow says Finnick Such a young man when he rose topower Such a clever one to keep it How you must askyourself did he do it One word Thats all you really needto know Poison Finnick goes back to Snows politicalascension which I know nothing of and works his way up tothe present pointing out case after case of the mysteriousdeaths of Snows adversaries or even worse his allieswho had the potential to become threats People droppingdead at a feast or slowly inexplicably declining intoshadows over a period of months Blamed on bad shellfishelusive viruses or an overlooked weakness in the aortaSnow drinking from the poisoned cup himself to deflectsuspicion But antidotes dont always work They say thatswhy he wears the roses that reek of perfume They say itsto cover the scent of blood from the mouth sores that willnever heal They say they say they saySnow has a listand no one knows who will be nextPoison The perfect weapon for a snakeSince my opinion of the Capitol and its noble presidentare already so low I cant say Finnicks allegations shockme They seem to have far more effect on the displacedCapitol rebels like my crew and Fulviaeven Plutarchoccasionally reacts in surprise maybe wondering how aspecific tidbit passed him by When Finnick finishes theyjust keep the cameras rolling until finally he has to be theone to say CutThe crew hurries inside to edit the material andPlutarch leads Finnick off for a chat probably to see if hehas any more stories Im left with Haymitch in the rubblewondering if Finnicks fate would have one day been mineWhy not Snow could have gotten a really good price forthe girl on fireIs that what happened to you I ask HaymitchNo My mother and younger brother My girl Theywere all dead two weeks after I was crowned victorBecause of that stunt I pulled with the force field heanswers Snow had no one to use against meIm surprised he didnt just kill you I sayOh no I was the example The person to hold up tothe young Finnicks and Johannas and Cashmeres Of whatcould happen to a victor who caused problems saysHaymitch But he knew he had no leverage against meUntil Peeta and I came along I say softly I dont evenget a shrug in returnWith our job done theres nothing left for Finnick andme to do but wait We try to fill the dragging minutes inSpecial Defense Tie knots Push our lunch around ourbowls Blow things up on the shooting range Because ofthe danger of detection no communication comes from therescue team At  the designated hour we standtense and silent in the back of a room full of screens andcomputers and watch Beetee and his team try to dominatethe airwaves His usual fidgety distraction is replaced witha determination I have never seen Most of my interviewdoesnt make the cut just enough to show I am alive andstill defiant It is Finnicks salacious and gory account of theCapitol that takes the day Is Beetees skill improving Orare his counterparts in the Capitol a little too fascinated towant to tune Finnick out For the next sixty minutes theCapitol feed alternates between the standard afternoonnewscast Finnick and attempts to black it all out But therebel techno team manages to override even the latter andin a real coup keeps control for almost the entire attack onSnowLet it go says Beetee throwing up his handsrelinquishing the broadcast back to the Capitol He mopshis face with a cloth If theyre not out of there by nowtheyre all dead He spins in his chair to see Finnick andme reacting to his words It was a good plan though DidPlutarch show it to youOf course not Beetee takes us to another room andshows us how the team with the help of rebel insiders willattempthas attemptedto free the victors from anunderground prison It seems to have involved knockoutgas distributed by the ventilation system a power failurethe detonation of a bomb in a government building severalmiles from the prison and now the disruption of thebroadcast Beetees glad we find the plan hard to followbecause then our enemies will tooLike your electricity trap in the arena I askExactly And see how well that worked out saysBeeteeWellnot really I thinkFinnick and I try to station ourselves in Commandwhere surely first word of the rescue will come but we arebarred because serious war business is being carried outWe refuse to leave Special Defense and end up waiting inthe hummingbird room for newsMaking knots Making knots No word Making knotsTicktock This is a clock Do not think of Gale Do not thinkof Peeta Making knots We do not want dinner Fingersraw and bleeding Finnick finally gives up and assumes thehunched position he took in the arena when the jabberjaysattacked I perfect my miniature noose The words of TheHanging Tree replay in my head Gale and Peeta Peetaand GaleDid you love Annie right away Finnick I askNo A long time passes before he adds She creptup on meI search my heart but at the moment the only person Ican feel creeping up on me is SnowIt must be midnight it must be tomorrow whenHaymitch pushes open the door Theyre back Werewanted in the hospital My mouth opens with a flood ofquestions that he cuts off with Thats all I knowI want to run but Finnicks acting so strange as if heslost the ability to move so I take his hand and lead him likea small child Through Special Defense into the elevatorthat goes this way and that and on to the hospital wing Theplace is in an uproar with doctors shouting orders and thewounded being wheeled through the halls in their bedsWere sideswiped by a gurney bearing anunconscious emaciated young woman with a shaved headHer flesh shows bruises and oozing scabs JohannaMason Who actually knew rebel secrets At least the oneabout me And this is how she has paid for itThrough a doorway I catch a glimpse of Gale strippedto the waist perspiration streaming down his face as adoctor removes something from under his shoulder bladewith a long pair of tweezers Wounded but alive I call hisname start toward him until a nurse pushes me back andshuts me outFinnick Something between a shriek and a cry ofjoy A lovely if somewhat bedraggled young womandarktangled hair sea green eyesruns toward us in nothing buta sheet Finnick And suddenly its as if theres no one inthe world but these two crashing through space to reacheach other They collide enfold lose their balance andslam against a wall where they stay Clinging into onebeing IndivisibleA pang of jealousy hits me Not for either Finnick orAnnie but for their certainty No one seeing them coulddoubt their loveBoggs looking a little worse for wear but uninjuredfinds Haymitch and me We got them all out ExceptEnobaria But since shes from Two we doubt shes beingheld anyway Peetas at the end of the hall The effects ofthe gas are just wearing off You should be there when hewakesPeetaAlive and wellmaybe not well but alive and hereAway from Snow Safe Here With me In a minute I cantouch him See his smile Hear his laughHaymitchs grinning at me Come on then he saysIm lightheaded with giddiness What will I say Ohwho cares what I say Peeta will be ecstatic no matter whatI do Hell probably be kissing me anyway I wonder if it willfeel like those last kisses on the beach in the arena theones I havent dared let myself consider until this momentPeetas awake already sitting on the side of the bedlooking bewildered as a trio of doctors reassure him flashlights in his eyes check his pulse Im disappointed thatmine was not the first face he saw when he woke but hesees it now His features register disbelief and somethingmore intense that I cant quite place Desire DesperationSurely both for he sweeps the doctors aside leaps to hisfeet and moves toward me I run to meet him my armsextended to embrace him His hands are reaching for metoo to caress my face I thinkMy lips are just forming his name when his fingers lockaround my throatThe cold collar chafes my neck and makes theshivering even harder to control At least I am no longer inthe claustrophobic tube while the machines click and whiraround me listening to a disembodied voice telling me tohold still while I try to convince myself I can still breatheEven now when Ive been assured there will be nopermanent damage I hunger for airThe medical teams main concernsdamage to myspinal cord airway veins and arterieshave been allayedBruising hoarseness the sore larynx this strange littlecoughnot to be worried about It will all be fine TheMockingjay will not lose her voice Where I want to ask isthe doctor who determines if I am losing my mind Only Imnot supposed to talk right now I cant even thank Boggswhen he comes to check on me To look me over and tellme hes seen a lot worse injuries among the soldiers whenthey teach choke holds in trainingIt was Boggs who knocked out Peeta with one blowbefore any permanent damage could be done I knowHaymitch would have come to my defense if he hadnt beenutterly unprepared To catch both Haymitch and myself offguard is a rare thing But we have been so consumed withsaving Peeta so tortured by having him in the Capitolshands that the elation at having him back blinded us If Idhad a private reunion with Peeta he would have killed meNow that hes derangedNo not deranged I remind myself Hijacked Thatsthe word I heard pass between Plutarch and Haymitch as Iwas wheeled past them in the hallway Hijacked I dontknow what it meansPrim who appeared moments after the attack and hasstayed as close to me as possible ever since spreadsanother blanket over me I think theyll take the collar offsoon Katniss You wont be so cold then My motherwhos been assisting in a complicated surgery has still notbeen informed of Peetas assault Prim takes one of myhands which is clutched in a fist and massages it until itopens and blood begins to flow through my fingers againShes starting on the second fist when the doctors show upremove the collar and give me a shot of something for painand swelling I lie as instructed with my head still notaggravating the injuries to my neckPlutarch Haymitch and Beetee have been waiting inthe hall for the doctors to give them clearance to see me Idont know if theyve told Gale but since hes not here Iassume they havent Plutarch ushers the doctors out andtries to order Prim to go as well but she says No If youforce me to leave Ill go directly to surgery and tell mymother everything thats happened And I warn you shedoesnt think much of a Gamemaker calling the shots onKatnisss life Especially when youve taken such poor careof herPlutarch looks offended but Haymitch chuckles Id letit go Plutarch he says Prim staysSo Katniss Peetas condition has come as a shockto all of us says Plutarch We couldnt help but notice hisdeterioration in the last two interviews Obviously hedbeen abused and we put his psychological state down tothat Now we believe something more was going on Thatthe Capitol has been subjecting him to a rather uncommontechnique known as hijacking BeeteeIm sorry Beetee says but I cant tell you all thespecifics of it Katniss The Capitols very secretive aboutthis form of torture and I believe the results areinconsistent This we do know Its a type of fearconditioning The term hijack comes from an old Englishword that means to capture or even better seize Webelieve it was chosen because the technique involves theuse of tracker jacker venom and the jack suggestedhijack You were stung in your first Hunger Games sounlike most of us you have firsthand knowledge of theeffects of the venomTerror Hallucinations Nightmarish visions of losingthose I love Because the venom targets the part of thebrain that houses fearIm sure you remember how frightening it was Did youalso suffer mental confusion in the aftermath asksBeetee A sense of being unable to judge what was trueand what was false Most people who have been stungand lived to tell about it report something of the kindYes That encounter with Peeta Even after I wasclearheaded I wasnt sure if he had saved my life by takingon Cato or if Id imagined itRecall is made more difficult because memories canbe changed Beetee taps his forehead Brought to theforefront of your mind altered and saved again in therevised form Now imagine that I ask you to remembersomethingeither with a verbal suggestion or by makingyou watch a tape of the eventand while that experience isrefreshed I give you a dose of tracker jacker venom Notenough to induce a threeday blackout Just enough toinfuse the memory with fear and doubt And thats what yourbrain puts in longterm storageI start to feel sick Prim asks the question thats in mymind Is that what theyve done to Peeta Taken hismemories of Katniss and distorted them so theyre scaryBeetee nods So scary that hed see her as lifethreateningThat he might try to kill her Yes thats ourcurrent theoryI cover my face with my arms because this isnthappening It isnt possible For someone to make Peetaforget he loves meno one could do thatBut you can reverse it right asks PrimUmvery little data on that says Plutarch Nonereally If hijacking rehabilitation has been attempted beforewe have no access to those recordsWell youre going to try arent you Prim persistsYoure not just going to lock him up in some padded roomand leave him to sufferOf course well try Prim says Beetee Its just wedont know to what degree well succeed If any My guessis that fearful events are the hardest to root out Theyre theones we naturally remember the best after allAnd apart from his memories of Katniss we dont yetknow what else has been tampered with says PlutarchWere putting together a team of mental health and militaryprofessionals to come up with a counterattack I personallyfeel optimistic that hell make a full recoveryDo you asks Prim caustically And what do youthink HaymitchI shift my arms slightly so I can see his expressionthrough the crack Hes exhausted and discouraged as headmits I think Peeta might get somewhat better ButIdont think hell ever be the same I snap my arms backtogether closing the crack shutting them all outAt least hes alive says Plutarch as if hes losingpatience with the lot of us Snow executed Peetas stylistand his prep team on live television tonight Weve no ideawhat happened to Effie Trinket Peetas damaged but heshere With us And thats a definite improvement over hissituation twelve hours ago Lets keep that in mind allrightPlutarchs attempt to cheer me uplaced with the newsof another four possibly five murderssomehow backfiresPortia Peetas prep team Effie The effort to fight backtears makes my throat throb until Im gasping againEventually they have no choice but to sedate meWhen I wake I wonder if this will be the only way Isleep now with drugs shot into my arm Im glad Im notsupposed to talk for the next few days because theresnothing I want to say Or do In fact Im a model patient mylethargy taken for restraint obedience to the doctorsorders I no longer feel like crying In fact I can only manageto hold on to one simple thought an image of Snows faceaccompanied by the whisper in my head I will kill youMy mother and Prim take turns nursing me coaxingme to swallow bites of soft food People come inperiodically to give me updates on Peetas condition Thehigh levels of tracker jacker venom are working their wayout of his body Hes being treated only by strangersnatives of no one from home or the Capitol has beenallowed to see himto keep any dangerous memories fromtriggering A team of specialists works long hoursdesigning a strategy for his recoveryGales not supposed to visit me as hes confined tobed with some kind of shoulder wound But on the thirdnight after Ive been medicated and the lights turned downlow for bedtime he slips silently into my room He doesntspeak just runs his fingers over the bruises on my neckwith a touch as light as moth wings plants a kiss betweenmy eyes and disappearsThe next morning Im discharged from the hospital withinstructions to move quietly and speak only whennecessary Im not imprinted with a schedule so I wanderaround aimlessly until Prims excused from her hospitalduties to take me to our familys latest compartment Identical to the last one but with no windowButtercup has now been issued a daily food allowanceand a pan of sand thats kept under the bathroom sink AsPrim tucks me into bed he hops up on my pillow vying forher attention She cradles him but stays focused on meKatniss I know this whole thing with Peeta is terrible foryou But remember Snow worked on him for weeks andweve only had him for a few days Theres a chance thatthe old Peeta the one who loves you is still inside Tryingto get back to you Dont give up on himI look at my little sister and think how she has inheritedthe best qualities our family has to offer my mothershealing hands my fathers level head and my fight Theressomething else there as well something entirely her ownAn ability to look into the confusing mess of life and seethings for what they are Is it possible she could be rightThat Peeta could return to meI have to get back to the hospital Prim says placingButtercup on the bed beside me You two keep each othercompany okayButtercup springs off the bed and follows her to thedoor complaining loudly when hes left behind Were aboutas much company for each other as dirt After maybe thirtyseconds I know I cant stand being confined in thesubterranean cell and leave Buttercup to his own devices Iget lost several times but eventually I make my way downto Special Defense Everyone I pass stares at the bruisesand I cant help feeling selfconscious to the point that I tugmy collar up to my earsGale must have been released from the hospital thismorning as well because I find him in one of the researchrooms with Beetee Theyre immersed heads bent over adrawing taking a measurement Versions of the picturelitter the table and floor Tacked on the corkboard walls andoccupying several computer screens are other designs ofsome sort In the rough lines of one I recognize Galestwitchup snare What are these I ask hoarsely pullingtheir attention from the sheetAh Katniss youve found us out says BeeteecheerfullyWhat Is this a secret I know Gales been downhere working with Beetee a lot but I assumed they weremessing around with bows and gunsNot really But Ive felt a little guilty about it StealingGale away from you so much Beetee admitsSince Ive spent most of my time in  disorientedworried angry being remade or hospitalized I cant sayGales absences have inconvenienced me Things haventbeen exactly harmonious between us either But I letBeetee think he owes me I hope youve been putting histime to good useCome and see he says waving me over to acomputer screenThis is what theyve been doing Taking thefundamental ideas behind Gales traps and adapting theminto weapons against humans Bombs mostly Its lessabout the mechanics of the traps than the psychologybehind them Boobytrapping an area that providessomething essential to survival A water or food supplyFrightening prey so that a large number flee into a greaterdestruction Endangering offspring in order to draw in theactual desired target the parent Luring the victim into whatappears to be a safe havenwhere death awaits it Atsome point Gale and Beetee left the wilderness behindand focused on more human impulses Like compassion Abomb explodes Time is allowed for people to rush to theaid of the wounded Then a second more powerful bombkills them as wellThat seems to be crossing some kind of line I saySo anything goes They both stare at meBeetee withdoubt Gale with hostility I guess there isnt a rule book forwhat might be unacceptable to do to another human beingSure there is Beetee and I have been following thesame rule book President Snow used when he hijackedPeeta says GaleCruel but to the point I leave without further comment Ifeel if I dont get outside immediately Ill just go ballistic butIm still in Special Defense when Im waylaid by HaymitchCome on he says We need you back up at thehospitalWhat for I askTheyre going to try something on Peeta he answersSend in the most innocuous person from Twelve they cancome up with Find someone Peeta might share childhoodmemories with but nothing too close to you Theyrescreening people nowI know this will be a difficult task since anyone Peetashares childhood memories with would most likely be fromtown and almost none of those people escaped theflames But when we reach the hospital room that has beenturned into a work space for Peetas recovery team thereshe sits chatting with Plutarch Delly Cartwright As alwaysshe gives me a smile that suggests Im her best friend inthe world She gives this smile to everyone Katniss shecalls outHey Delly I say Id heard she and her youngerbrother had survived Her parents who ran the shoe shop intown werent as lucky She looks older wearing the drab clothes that flatter no one with her long yellow hair in apractical braid instead of curls Dellys a bit thinner than Iremember but she was one of the few kids in District with a couple of pounds to spare The diet here the stressthe grief of losing her parents have all no doubtcontributed How are you doing I askOh its been a lot of changes all at once Her eyes fillwith tears But everyones really nice here in Thirteen dontyou thinkDelly means it She genuinely likes people All peoplenot just a select few shes spent years making up her mindaboutTheyve made an effort to make us feel welcome Isay I think thats a fair statement without going overboardAre you the one theyve picked to see PeetaI guess so Poor Peeta Poor you Ill neverunderstand the Capitol she saysBetter not to maybe I tell herDellys known Peeta for a long time says PlutarchOh yes Dellys face brightens We played togetherfrom when we were little I used to tell people he was mybrotherWhat do you think Haymitch asks me Anything thatmight trigger memories of youWe were all in the same class But we neveroverlapped much I sayKatniss was always so amazing I never dreamed shewould notice me says Delly The way she could hunt andgo in the Hob and everything Everyone admired her soHaymitch and I both have to take a hard look at herface to doublecheck if shes joking To hear Delly describeit I had next to no friends because I intimidated people bybeing so exceptional Not true I had next to no friendsbecause I wasnt friendly Leave it to Delly to spin me intosomething wonderfulDelly always thinks the best of everyone I explain Idont think Peeta could have bad memories associatedwith her Then I remember Wait In the Capitol When Ilied about recognizing the Avox girl Peeta covered for meand said she looked like DellyI remember says Haymitch But I dont know Itwasnt true Delly wasnt actually there I dont think it cancompete with years of childhood memoriesEspecially with such a pleasant companion as Dellysays Plutarch Lets give it a shotPlutarch Haymitch and I go to the observation roomnext to where Peetas confined Its crowded with tenmembers of his recovery team armed with pens andclipboards The oneway glass and audio setup allow us towatch Peeta secretly He lies on the bed his armsstrapped down He doesnt fight the restraints but hishands fidget continuously His expression seems morelucid than when he tried to strangle me but its still not onethat belongs to himWhen the door quietly opens his eyes widen in alarmthen become confused Delly crosses the room tentativelybut as she nears him she naturally breaks into a smilePeeta Its Delly From homeDelly Some of the clouds seem to clear Delly ItsyouYes she says with obvious relief How do you feelAwful Where are we Whats happened asksPeetaHere we go says HaymitchI told her to steer clear of any mention of Katniss orthe Capitol says Plutarch Just see how much of homeshe could conjure upWellwere in District Thirteen We live here nowsays DellyThats what those people have been saying But itmakes no sense Why arent we home asks PeetaDelly bites her lip There wasan accident I misshome badly too I was only just thinking about those chalkdrawings we used to do on the paving stones Yours wereso wonderful Remember when you made each one adifferent animalYeah Pigs and cats and things says Peeta Yousaidabout an accidentI can see the sheen of sweat on Dellys forehead asshe tries to work around the question It was bad Noonecould stay she says haltinglyHang in there girl says HaymitchBut I know youre going to like it here Peeta Thepeople have been really nice to us Theres always foodand clean clothes and schools much more interestingsays DellyWhy hasnt my family come to see me Peeta asksThey cant Dellys tearing up again A lot of peopledidnt get out of Twelve So well need to make a new lifehere Im sure they could use a good baker Do youremember when your father used to let us make dough girlsand boysThere was a fire Peeta says suddenlyYes she whispersTwelve burned down didnt it Because of her saysPeeta angrily Because of Katniss He begins to pull onthe restraintsOh no Peeta It wasnt her fault says DellyDid she tell you that he hisses at herGet her out of there says Plutarch The door opensimmediately and Delly begins to back toward it slowlyShe didnt have to I was Delly beginsBecause shes lying Shes a liar You cant believeanything she says Shes some kind of mutt the Capitolcreated to use against the rest of us Peeta shoutsNo Peeta Shes not a Delly tries againDont trust her Delly says Peeta in a frantic voice Idid and she tried to kill me She killed my friends Myfamily Dont even go near her Shes a muttA hand reaches through the doorway pulls Delly outand the door swings shut But Peeta keeps yelling A muttShes a stinking muttNot only does he hate me and want to kill me he nolonger believes Im human It was less painful beingstrangledAround me the recovery team members scribble likecrazy taking down every word Haymitch and Plutarch grabmy arms and propel me out of the room They lean me upagainst a wall in the silent hallway But I know Peetacontinues to scream behind the door and the glassPrim was wrong Peeta is irretrievable I cant stayhere anymore I say numbly If you want me to be theMockingjay youll have to send me awayWhere do you want to go asks HaymitchThe Capitol Its the only place I can think of where Ihave a job to doCant do it Plutarch says Not until all the districtsare secure Good news is the fightings almost over in all ofthem but Two Its a tough nut to crack thoughThats right First the districts Next the Capitol Andthen I hunt down SnowFine I say Send me to TwoDistrict  is a large district as one might expectcomposed of a series of villages spread across themountains Each was originally associated with a mine orquarry although now many are devoted to the housing andtraining of Peacekeepers None of this would present muchof a challenge since the rebels have s airpower on theirside except for one thing At the center of the district is avirtually impenetrable mountain that houses the heart of theCapitols militaryWeve nicknamed the mountain the Nut since I relayedPlutarchs tough nut to crack comment to the weary anddiscouraged rebel leaders here The Nut was establisheddirectly after the Dark Days when the Capitol had lost and was desperate for a new underground stronghold Theyhad some of their military resources situated on theoutskirts of the Capitol itselfnuclear missiles aircrafttroopsbut a significant chunk of their power was nowunder an enemys control Of course there was no way theycould hope to replicate  which was the work of centuriesHowever in the old mines of nearby District  they sawopportunity From the air the Nut appeared to be justanother mountain with a few entrances on its faces Butinside were vast cavernous spaces where slabs of stoneshad been cut hauled to the surface and transported downslippery narrow roads to make distant buildings There waseven a train system to facilitate transporting the minersfrom the Nut to the very center of the main town in District It ran right to the square that Peeta and I visited during theVictory Tour standing on the wide marble steps of theJustice Building trying not to look too closely at Catos andCloves grieving families assembled below usIt was not the most ideal terrain plagued as it was bymudslides floods and avalanches But the advantagesoutweighed the concerns As theyd cut deep into themountain the miners had left large pillars and walls of stoneto support the infrastructure The Capitol reinforced theseand set about making the mountain their new military baseFilling it with computer banks and meeting rooms barracksand arsenals Widening entrances to allow the exit ofhovercraft from the hangar installing missile launchers Buton the whole leaving the exterior of the mountain largelyunchanged A rough rocky tangle of trees and wildlife Anatural fortress to protect them from their enemiesBy the other districts standards the Capitol babiedthe inhabitants here Just by looking at the District  rebelsyou can tell they were decently fed and cared for inchildhood Some did end up as quarry and mine workersOthers were educated for jobs in the Nut or funneled intothe ranks of Peacekeepers Trained young and hard forcombat The Hunger Games were an opportunity for wealthand a kind of glory not seen elsewhere Of course thepeople of  swallowed the Capitols propaganda moreeasily than the rest of us Embraced their ways But for allthat at the end of the day they were still slaves And if thatwas lost on the citizens who became Peacekeepers orworked in the Nut it was not lost on the stonecutters whoformed the backbone of the resistance hereThings stand as they did when I arrived two weeksago The outer villages are in rebel hands the town dividedand the Nut is as untouchable as ever Its few entrancesheavily fortified its heart safely enfolded in the mountainWhile every other district has now wrested control from theCapitol  remains in its pocketEach day I do whatever I can to help Visit thewounded Tape short propos with my camera crew Im notallowed in actual combat but they invite me to the meetingson the status of the war which is a lot more than they did in Its much better here Freer no schedules on my armfewer demands on my time I live aboveground in the rebelvillages or surrounding caves For safetys sake Imrelocated often During the day Ive been given clearanceto hunt as long as I take a guard along and dont stray toofar In the thin cold mountain air I feel some physicalstrength returning my mind clearing away the rest of thefogginess But with this mental clarity comes an evensharper awareness of what has been done to PeetaSnow has stolen him from me twisted him beyondrecognition and made me a present of him Boggs whocame to  when I did told me that even with all the plottingit was a little too easy to rescue Peeta He believes if hadnt made the effort Peeta wouldve been delivered tome anyway Dropped off in an actively warring district orperhaps  itself Tied up with ribbons and tagged with myname Programmed to murder meIts only now that hes been corrupted that I can fullyappreciate the real Peeta Even more than I wouldve if heddied The kindness the steadiness the warmth that had anunexpected heat behind it Outside of Prim my mother andGale how many people in the world love meunconditionally I think in my case the answer may now benone Sometimes when Im alone I take the pearl fromwhere it lives in my pocket and try to remember the boy withthe bread the strong arms that warded off nightmares onthe train the kisses in the arena To make myself put aname to the thing Ive lost But whats the use Its goneHes gone Whatever existed between us is gone All thatsleft is my promise to kill Snow I tell myself this ten times adayBack in  Peetas rehabilitation continues Eventhough I dont ask Plutarch gives me cheerful updates onthe phone like Good news Katniss I think weve almostgot him convinced youre not a mutt Or Today he wasallowed to feed himself puddingWhen Haymitch gets on after he admits Peetas nobetter The only dubious ray of hope has come from mysister Prim came up with the idea of trying to hijack himback Haymitch tells me Bring up the distorted memoriesof you and then give him a big dose of a calming drug likemorphling Weve only tried it on one memory The tape ofthe two of you in the cave when you told him that storyabout getting Prim the goatAny improvement I askWell if extreme confusion is an improvement overextreme terror then yes says Haymitch But Im not sure itis He lost the ability to speak for several hours Went intosome sort of stupor When he came out the only thing heasked about was the goatRight I sayHows it out there he asksNo forward motion I tell himWere sending out a team to help with the mountainBeetee and some of the others he says You know thebrainsWhen the brains are selected Im not surprised to seeGales name on the list I thought Beetee would bring himnot for his technological expertise but in the hopes that hecould somehow think of a way to ensnare a mountainOriginally Gale offered to come with me to  but I couldsee I was tearing him away from his work with Beetee I toldhim to sit tight and stay where he was most needed I didnttell him his presence would make it even more difficult forme to mourn PeetaGale finds me when they arrive late one afternoon Imsitting on a log at the edge of my current village plucking agoose A dozen or so of the birds are piled at my feetGreat flocks of them have been migrating through heresince Ive arrived and the pickings are easy Without aword Gale settles beside me and begins to relieve a birdof its feathers Were through about half when he says Anychance well get to eat theseYeah Most go to the camp kitchen but they expectme to give a couple to whoever Im staying with tonight Isay For keeping meIsnt the honor of the thing enough he saysYoud think I reply But words gotten out thatmockingjays are hazardous to your healthWe pluck in silence for a while longer Then he says Isaw Peeta yesterday Through the glassWhatd you think I askSomething selfish says GaleThat you dont have to be jealous of him anymoreMy fingers give a yank and a cloud of feathers floats downaround usNo Just the opposite Gale pulls a feather out of myhair I thoughtIll never compete with that No matter howmuch pain Im in He spins the feather between his thumband forefinger I dont stand a chance if he doesnt getbetter Youll never be able to let him go Youll always feelwrong about being with meThe way I always felt wrong kissing him because ofyou I sayGale holds my gaze If I thought that was true I couldalmost live with the rest of itIt is true I admit But so is what you said aboutPeetaGale makes a sound of exasperation Nonethelessafter weve dropped off the birds and volunteered to goback to the woods to gather kindling for the evening fire Ifind myself wrapped in his arms His lips brushing the fadedbruises on my neck working their way to my mouthDespite what I feel for Peeta this is when I accept deepdown that hell never come back to me Or Ill never go backto him Ill stay in  until it falls go to the Capitol and killSnow and then die for my trouble And hell die insane andhating me So in the fading light I shut my eyes and kissGale to make up for all the kisses Ive withheld andbecause it doesnt matter anymore and because Im sodesperately lonely I cant stand itGales touch and taste and heat remind me that atleast my bodys still alive and for the moment its awelcome feeling I empty my mind and let the sensationsrun through my flesh happy to lose myself When Gale pullsaway slightly I move forward to close the gap but I feel hishand under my chin Katniss he says The instant I openmy eyes the world seems disjointed This is not our woodsor our mountains or our way My hand automatically goes tothe scar on my left temple which I associate with confusionNow kiss me Bewildered unblinking I stand there whilehe leans in and presses his lips to mine briefly Heexamines my face closely Whats going on in your headI dont know I whisper backThen its like kissing someone whos drunk It doesntcount he says with a weak attempt at a laugh He scoopsup a pile of kindling and drops it in my empty armsreturning me to myselfHow do you know I say mostly to cover myembarrassment Have you kissed someone whos drunkI guess Gale couldve been kissing girls right and left backin  He certainly had enough takers I never thought aboutit much beforeHe just shakes his head No But its not hard toimagineSo you never kissed any other girls I askI didnt say that You know you were only twelve whenwe met And a real pain besides I did have a life outside ofhunting with you he says loading up with firewoodSuddenly Im genuinely curious Who did you kissAnd whereToo many to remember Behind the school on theslag heap you name it he saysI roll my eyes So when did I become so specialWhen they carted me off to the CapitolNo About six months before that Right after NewYears We were in the Hob eating some slop of GreasySaes And Darius was teasing you about trading a rabbitfor one of his kisses And I realizedI minded he tells meI remember that day Bitter cold and dark by four in theafternoon Wed been hunting but a heavy snow had drivenus back into town The Hob was crowded with peoplelooking for refuge from the weather Greasy Saes soupmade with stock from the bones of a wild dog wed shot aweek earlier was below her usual standards Still it washot and I was starving as I scooped it up sitting crossleggedon her counter Darius was leaning on the post ofthe stall tickling my cheek with the end of my braid while Ismacked his hand away He was explaining why one of hiskisses merited a rabbit or possibly two since everyoneknows redheaded men are the most virile And Greasy Saeand I were laughing because he was so ridiculous andpersistent and kept pointing out women around the Hobwho he said had paid far more than a rabbit to enjoy hislips See The one in the green muffler Go ahead andask her If you need a referenceA million miles from here a billion days ago thishappened Darius was just joking around I sayProbably Although youd be the last to figure out if hewasnt Gale tells me Take Peeta Take me Or evenFinnick I was starting to worry he had his eye on you buthe seems back on track nowYou dont know Finnick if you think hed love me IsayGale shrugs I know he was desperate That makespeople do all kinds of crazy thingsI cant help thinking thats directed at meBright and early the next morning the brains assembleto take on the problem of the Nut Im asked to the meetingalthough I dont have much to contribute I avoid theconference table and perch in the wide windowsill that hasa view of the mountain in question The commander from a middleaged woman named Lyme takes us on a virtualtour of the Nut its interior and fortifications and recountsthe failed attempts to seize it Ive crossed paths with herbriefly a couple of times since my arrival and was doggedby the feeling Id met her before Shes memorable enoughstanding over six feet tall and heavily muscled But its onlywhen I see a clip of her in the field leading a raid on themain entrance of the Nut that something clicks and I realizeIm in the presence of another victor Lyme the tribute fromDistrict  who won her Hunger Games over a generationago Effie sent us her tape among others to prepare forthe Quarter Quell Ive probably caught glimpses of herduring the Games over the years but shes kept a lowprofile With my newfound knowledge of Haymitchs andFinnicks treatment all I can think is What did the Capitoldo to her after she wonWhen Lyme finishes the presentation the questionsfrom the brains begin Hours pass and lunch comes andgoes as they try to come up with a realistic plan for takingthe Nut But while Beetee thinks he might be able tooverride certain computer systems and theres somediscussion of putting the handful of internal spies to use noone has any really innovative thoughts As the afternoonwears on talk keeps returning to a strategy that has beentried repeatedlythe storming of the entrances I can seeLymes frustration building because so many variations ofthis plan have already failed so many of her soldiers havebeen lost Finally she bursts out The next person whosuggests we take the entrances better have a brilliant wayto do it because youre going to be the one leading thatmissionGale who is too restless to sit at the table for morethan a few hours has been alternating between pacing andsharing my windowsill Early on he seemed to acceptLymes assertion that the entrances couldnt be taken anddropped out of the conversation entirely For the last hour orso hes sat quietly his brow knitted in concentrationstaring at the Nut through the window glass In the silencethat follows Lymes ultimatum he speaks up Is it really sonecessary that we take the Nut Or would it be enough todisable itThat would be a step in the right direction saysBeetee What do you have in mindThink of it as a wild dog den Gale continues Yourenot going to fight your way in So you have two choicesTrap the dogs inside or flush them outWeve tried bombing the entrances says LymeTheyre set too far inside the stone for any real damage tobe doneI wasnt thinking of that says Gale I was thinking ofusing the mountain Beetee rises and joins Gale at thewindow peering through his illfitting glasses SeeRunning down the sidesAvalanche paths says Beetee under his breath Itdbe tricky Wed have to design the detonation sequencewith great care and once its in motion we couldnt hope tocontrol itWe dont need to control it if we give up the idea thatwe have to possess the Nut says Gale Only shut itdownSo youre suggesting we start avalanches and blockthe entrances asks LymeThats it says Gale Trap the enemy inside cut offfrom supplies Make it impossible for them to send out theirhovercraftWhile everyone considers the plan Boggs flipsthrough a stack of blueprints of the Nut and frowns Yourisk killing everyone inside Look at the ventilation systemIts rudimentary at best Nothing like what we have inThirteen It depends entirely on pumping in air from themountainsides Block those vents and youll suffocatewhoever is trappedThey could still escape through the train tunnel to thesquare says BeeteeNot if we blow it up says Gale brusquely His intenthis full intent becomes clear Gale has no interest inpreserving the lives of those in the Nut No interest incaging the prey for later useThis is one of his death trapsThe implications of what Gale is suggesting settlequietly around the room You can see the reaction playingout on peoples faces The expressions range frompleasure to distress from sorrow to satisfactionThe majority of the workers are citizens from Twosays Beetee neutrallySo what says Gale Well never be able to trustthem againThey should at least have a chance to surrendersays LymeWell thats a luxury we werent given when they firebombedTwelve but youre all so much cozier with theCapitol here says Gale By the look on Lymes face I thinkshe might shoot him or at least take a swing Shedprobably have the upper hand too with all her training Buther anger only seems to infuriate him and he yells Wewatched children burn to death and there was nothing wecould doI have to close my eyes a minute as the image ripsthrough me It has the desired effect I want everyone in thatmountain dead Am about to say so But thenIm also agirl from District  Not President Snow I cant help it Icant condemn someone to the death hes suggestingGale I say taking his arm and trying to speak in areasonable tone The Nuts an old mine Itd be likecausing a massive coal mining accident Surely the wordsare enough to make anyone from  think twice about theplanBut not so quick as the one that killed our fathers heretorts Is that everyones problem That our enemiesmight have a few hours to reflect on the fact that theyredying instead of just being blown to bitsBack in the old days when we were nothing more thana couple of kids hunting outside of  Gale said things likethis and worse But then they were just words Here put intopractice they become deeds that can never be reversedYou dont know how those District Two people endedup in the Nut I say They may have been coerced Theymay be held against their will Some are our own spies Willyou kill them tooI would sacrifice a few yes to take out the rest ofthem he replies And if I were a spy in there Id sayBring on the avalanchesI know hes telling the truth That Gale would sacrificehis life in this way for the causeno one doubts it Perhapswed all do the same if we were the spies and given thechoice I guess I would But its a coldhearted decision tomake for other people and those who love themYou said we had two choices Boggs tells him Totrap them or to flush them out I say we try to avalanche themountain but leave the train tunnel alone People canescape into the square where well be waiting for themHeavily armed I hope says Gale You can be suretheyll beHeavily armed Well take them prisoner agreesBoggsLets bring Thirteen into the loop now Beeteesuggests Let President Coin weigh inShell want to block the tunnel says Gale withconvictionYes most likely But you know Peeta did have a pointin his propos About the dangers of killing ourselves off Ivebeen playing with some numbers Factoring in thecasualties and the wounded andI think its at least worth aconversation says BeeteeOnly a handful of people are invited to be part of thatconversation Gale and I are released with the rest I takehim hunting so he can blow off some steam but hes nottalking about it Probably too angry with me for counteringhimThe call does happen a decision is made and byevening Im suited up in my Mockingjay outfit with my bowslung over my shoulder and an earpiece that connects meto Haymitch in just in case a good opportunity for apropo arises We wait on the roof of the Justice Buildingwith a clear view of our targetOur hoverplanes are initially ignored by thecommanders in the Nut because in the past theyve beenlittle more trouble than flies buzzing around a honeypot Butafter two rounds of bombings in the higher elevations of themountain the planes have their attention By the time theCapitols antiaircraft weapons begin to fire its already toolateGales plan exceeds anyones expectations Beeteewas right about being unable to control the avalanchesonce theyd been set in motion The mountainsides arenaturally unstable but weakened by the explosions theyseem almost fluid Whole sections of the Nut collapsebefore our eyes obliterating any sign that human beingshave ever set foot on the place We stand speechless tinyand insignificant as waves of stone thunder down themountain Burying the entrances under tons of rock Raisinga cloud of dirt and debris that blackens the sky Turning theNut into a tombI imagine the hell inside the mountain Sirens wailingLights flickering into darkness Stone dust choking the airThe shrieks of panicked trapped beings stumbling madlyfor a way out only to find the entrances the launchpad theventilation shafts themselves clogged with earth and rocktrying to force its way in Live wires flung free fires breakingout rubble making a familiar path a maze Peopleslamming shoving scrambling like ants as the hill pressesin threatening to crush their fragile shellsKatniss Haymitchs voice is in my earpiece I try toanswer back and find both of my hands are clamped tightlyover my mouth KatnissOn the day my father died the sirens went off duringmy school lunch No one waited for dismissal or wasexpected to The response to a mine accident wassomething outside the control of even the Capitol I ran toPrims class I still remember her tiny at seven very palebut sitting straight up with her hands folded on her deskWaiting for me to collect her as Id promised I would if thesirens ever sounded She sprang out of her seat grabbedmy coat sleeve and we wove through the streams ofpeople pouring out onto the streets to pool at the mainentrance of the mine We found our mother clenching therope that had been hastily strung to keep the crowd back Inretrospect I guess I should have known there was aproblem right then Because why were we looking for herwhen the reverse should have been trueThe elevators were screeching burning up and downtheir cables as they vomited smokeblackened miners intothe light of day With each group came cries of reliefrelatives diving under the rope to lead off their husbandswives children parents siblings We stood in the freezingair as the afternoon turned overcast a light snow dusted theearth The elevators moved more slowly now anddisgorged fewer beings I knelt on the ground and pressedmy hands into the cinders wanting so badly to pull myfather free If theres a more helpless feeling than trying toreach someone you love whos trapped underground I dontknow it The wounded The bodies The waiting through thenight Blankets put around your shoulders by strangers Amug of something hot that you dont drink And then finallyat dawn the grieved expression on the face of the minecaptain that could only mean one thingWhat did we just doKatniss Are you there Haymitch is probablymaking plans to have me fitted for a head shackle at thisvery momentI drop my hands YesGet inside Just in case the Capitol tries to retaliatewith whats left of its air force he instructsYes I repeat Everyone on the roof except for thesoldiers manning the machine guns begin to make theirway inside As I descend the stairs I cant help brushing myfingers along the unblemished white marble walls So coldand beautiful Even in the Capitol theres nothing to matchthe magnificence of this old building But there is no give tothe surfaceonly my flesh yields my warmth taken Stoneconquers people every timeI sit at the base of one of the gigantic pillars in thegreat entrance hall Through the doors I can see the whiteexpanse of marble that leads to the steps on the square Iremember how sick I was the day Peeta and I acceptedcongratulations there for winning the Games Worn down bythe Victory Tour failing in my attempt to calm the districtsfacing the memories of Clove and Cato particularly Catosgruesome slow death by muttsBoggs crouches down beside me his skin pale in theshadows We didnt bomb the train tunnel you knowSome of them will probably get outAnd then well shoot them when they show theirfaces I askOnly if we have to he answersWe could send in trains ourselves Help evacuate thewounded I sayNo It was decided to leave the tunnel in their handsThat way they can use all the tracks to bring people outsays Boggs Besides it will give us time to get the rest ofour soldiers to the squareA few hours ago the square

blocks so that we would control thetrain station in the event that the Nut fell Well its fallen Thereality has sunk in Any survivors will escape to the square Ican hear the gunfire starting again as the Peacekeepersare no doubt trying to fight their way in to rescue theircomrades Our own soldiers are being brought in to counterthisYoure cold says Boggs Ill see if I can find ablanket He goes before I can protest I dont want ablanket even if the marble continues to leech my body heatKatniss says Haymitch in my earStill here I answerInteresting turn of events with Peeta this afternoonThought youd want to know he says Interesting isntgood It isnt better But I dont really have any choice but tolisten We showed him that clip of you singing TheHanging Tree It was never aired so the Capitol couldntuse it when he was being hijacked He says he recognizedthe songFor a moment my heart skips a beat Then I realize itsjust more tracker jacker serum confusion He couldntHaymitch He never heard me sing that songNot you Your father He heard him singing it one daywhen he came to trade at the bakery Peeta was smallprobably six or seven but he remembered it because hewas specially listening to see if the birds stopped singingsays Haymitch Guess they didSix or seven That would have been before my motherbanned the song Maybe even right around the time I waslearning it Was I there tooDont think so No mention of you anyway But its thefirst connection to you that hasnt triggered some mentalmeltdown says Haymitch Its something at leastKatnissMy father He seems to be everywhere today Dying inthe mine Singing his way into Peetas muddledconsciousness Flickering in the look Boggs gives me ashe protectively wraps the blanket around my shoulders Imiss him so badly it hurtsThe gunfires really picking up outside Gale hurries bywith a group of rebels eagerly headed for the battle I dontpetition to join the fighters not that they would let me I haveno stomach for it anyway no heat in my blood I wish Peetawas herethe old Peetabecause he would be able toarticulate why it is so wrong to be exchanging fire whenpeople any people are trying to claw their way out of themountain Or is my own history making me too sensitiveArent we at war Isnt this just another way to kill ourenemiesNight falls quickly Huge bright spotlights are turnedon illuminating the square Every bulb must be burning atfull wattage inside the train station as well Even from myposition across the square I can see clearly through theplateglass front of the long narrow building It would beimpossible to miss the arrival of a train or even a singleperson But hours pass and no one comes With eachminute it becomes harder to imagine that anyone survivedthe assault on the NutIts well after midnight when Cressida comes to attacha special microphone to my costume Whats this for IaskHaymitchs voice comes on to explain I know yourenot going to like this but we need you to make a speechA speech I say immediately feeling queasyIll feed it to you line by line he assures me Youlljust have to repeat what I say Look theres no sign of lifefrom that mountain Weve won but the fightings continuingSo we thought if you went out on the steps of the JusticeBuilding and laid it outtold everybody that the Nutsdefeated that the Capitols presence in District Two isfinishedyou might be able to get the rest of their forces tosurrenderI peer at the darkness beyond the square I cant evensee their forcesThats what the mikes for he says Youll bebroadcast both your voice through their emergency audiosystem and your image wherever people have access to ascreenI know there are a couple of huge screens here on thesquare I saw them on the Victory Tour It might work if Iwere good at this sort of thing Which Im not They tried tofeed me lines in those early experiments with the propostoo and it was a flopYou could save a lot of lives Katniss Haymitch saysfinallyAll right Ill give it a try I tell himIts strange standing outside at the top of the stairsfully costumed brightly lit but with no visible audience todeliver my speech to Like Im doing a show for the moonLets make this quick says Haymitch Youre tooexposedMy television crew positioned out in the square withspecial cameras indicates that theyre ready I tellHaymitch to go ahead then click on my mike and listencarefully to him dictate the first line of the speech A hugeimage of me lights up one of the screens over the squareas I begin People of District Two this is KatnissEverdeen speaking to you from the steps of your JusticeBuilding whereThe pair of trains comes screeching into the trainstation side by side As the doors slide open peopletumble out in a cloud of smoke theyve brought from the NutThey must have had at least an inkling of what would awaitthem at the square because you can see them trying to actevasively Most of them flatten on the floor and a spray ofbullets inside the station takes out the lights Theyve comearmed as Gale predicted but theyve come wounded aswell The moans can be heard in the otherwise silent nightairSomeone kills the lights on the stairs leaving me in theprotection of shadow A flame blooms inside the stationone of the trains must actually be on fireand a thick blacksmoke billows against the windows Left with no choice thepeople begin to push out into the square choking butdefiantly waving their guns My eyes dart around therooftops that ring the square Every one of them has beenfortified with rebelmanned machine gun nests Moonlightglints off oiled barrelsA young man staggers out from the station one handpressed against a bloody cloth at his cheek the otherdragging a gun When he trips and falls to his face I seethe scorch marks down the back of his shirt the red fleshbeneath And suddenly hes just another burn victim from amine accidentMy feet fly down the steps and I take off running forhim Stop I yell at the rebels Hold your fire The wordsecho around the square and beyond as the mike amplifiesmy voice Stop Im nearing the young man reachingdown to help him when he drags himself up to his kneesand trains his gun on my headI instinctively back up a few steps raise my bow overmy head to show my intention was harmless Now that hehas both hands on his gun I notice the ragged hole in hischeek where somethingfalling stone maybepuncturedthe flesh He smells of burning things hair and meat andfuel His eyes are crazed with pain and fearFreeze Haymitchs voice whispers in my ear I followhis order realizing that this is what all of District  all ofPanem maybe must be seeing at the moment TheMockingjay at the mercy of a man with nothing to loseHis garbled speech is barely comprehensible Giveme one reason I shouldnt shoot youThe rest of the world recedes Theres only me lookinginto the wretched eyes of the man from the Nut who asks forone reason Surely I should be able to come up withthousands But the words that make it to my lips are IcantLogically the next thing that should happen is the manpulling the trigger But hes perplexed trying to make senseof my words I experience my own confusion as I realizewhat Ive said is entirely true and the noble impulse thatcarried me across the square is replaced by despair Icant Thats the problem isnt it I lower my bow We blewup your mine You burned my district to the ground Wevegot every reason to kill each other So do it Make theCapitol happy Im done killing their slaves for them I dropmy bow on the ground and give it a nudge with my boot Itslides across the stone and comes to rest at his kneesIm not their slave the man muttersI am I say Thats why I killed Catoand he killedThreshand he killed Cloveand she tried to kill me It justgoes around and around and who wins Not us Not thedistricts Always the Capitol But Im tired of being a piecein their GamesPeeta On the rooftop the night before our first HungerGames He understood it all before wed even set foot inthe arena I hope hes watching now that he remembersthat night as it happened and maybe forgives me when IdieKeep talking Tell them about watching the mountaingo down Haymitch insistsWhen I saw that mountain fall tonight Ithoughttheyve done it again Got me to kill youthepeople in the districts But why did I do it District Twelveand District Two have no fight except the one the Capitolgave us The young man blinks at me uncomprehendinglyI sink on my knees before him my voice low and urgentAnd why are you fighting with the rebels on the rooftopsWith Lyme who was your victor With people who wereyour neighbors maybe even your familyI dont know says the man But he doesnt take hisgun off meI rise and turn slowly in a circle addressing themachine guns And you up there I come from a miningtown Since when do miners condemn other miners to thatkind of death and then stand by to kill whoever manages tocrawl from the rubbleWho is the enemy whispers HaymitchThese peopleI indicate the wounded bodies on thesquareare not your enemy I whip back around to thetrain station The rebels are not your enemy We all haveone enemy and its the Capitol This is our chance to putan end to their power but we need every district person todo it The cameras are tight on me as I reach out my handsto the man to the wounded to the reluctant rebels acrossPanem Please Join usMy words hang in the air I look to the screen hoping tosee them recording some wave of reconciliation goingthrough the crowdInstead I watch myself get shot on televisionAlwaysIn the twilight of morphling Peeta whispers the wordand I go searching for him Its a gauzy violettinted worldwith no hard edges and many places to hide I pushthrough cloud banks follow faint tracks catch the scent ofcinnamon of dill Once I feel his hand on my cheek and tryto trap it but it dissolves like mist through my fingersWhen I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospitalroom in  I remember I was under the influence of sleepsyrup My heel had been injured after Id climbed out on abranch over the electric fence and dropped back into Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay withme as I was drifting off He had whispered something Icouldnt quite catch But some part of my brain had trappedhis single word of reply and let it swim up through mydreams to taunt me now AlwaysMorphling dulls the extremes of all emotions soinstead of a stab of sorrow I merely feel emptiness Ahollow of dead brush where flowers used to bloomUnfortunately theres not enough of the drug left in my veinsfor me to ignore the pain in the left side of my body Thatswhere the bullet hit My hands fumble over the thickbandages encasing my ribs and I wonder what Im stilldoing hereIt wasnt him the man kneeling before me on thesquare the burned one from the Nut He didnt pull thetrigger It was someone farther back in the crowd Therewas less a sense of penetration than the feeling that Idbeen struck with a sledgehammer Everything after themoment of impact is confusion riddled with gunfire I try tosit up but the only thing I manage is a moanThe white curtain that divides my bed from the nextpatients whips back and Johanna Mason stares down atme At first I feel threatened because she attacked me inthe arena I have to remind myself that she did it to save mylife It was part of the rebel plot But still that doesnt meanshe doesnt despise me Maybe her treatment of me wasall an act for the CapitolIm alive I say rustilyNo kidding brainless Johanna walks over andplunks down on my bed sending spikes of pain shootingacross my chest When she grins at my discomfort I knowwere not in for some warm reunion scene Still a littlesore With an expert hand she quickly detaches themorphling drip from my arm and plugs it into a socket tapedinto the crook of her own They started cutting back mysupply a few days ago Afraid Im going to turn into one ofthose freaks from Six Ive had to borrow from you when thecoast was clear Didnt think youd mindMind How can I mind when she was almost torturedto death by Snow after the Quarter Quell I have no right tomind and she knows itJohanna sighs as the morphling enters herbloodstream Maybe they were onto something in SixDrug yourself out and paint flowers on your body Not sucha bad life Seemed happier than the rest of us anywayIn the weeks since I left  shes gained some weightback A soft down of hair has sprouted on her shaved headhelping to hide some of the scars But if shes siphoning offmy morphling shes strugglingTheyve got this head doctor who comes around everyday Supposed to be helping me recover Like some guywhos spent his life in this rabbit warrens going to fix meup Complete idiot At least twenty times a session hereminds me that Im totally safe I manage a smile Its atruly stupid thing to say especially to a victor As if such astate of being ever existed anywhere for anyone Howabout you Mockingjay You feel totally safeOh yeah Right up until I got shot I sayPlease That bullet never even touched you Cinnasaw to that she saysI think of the layers of protective armor in myMockingjay outfit But the pain came from somewhereBroken ribsNot even Bruised pretty good The impact rupturedyour spleen They couldnt repair it She gives a dismissivewave of her hand Dont worry you dont need one And ifyou did theyd find you one wouldnt they Its everybodysjob to keep you aliveIs that why you hate me I askPartly she admits Jealousy is certainly involved Ialso think youre a little hard to swallow With your tackyromantic drama and your defenderofthehelpless act Onlyit isnt an act which makes you more unbearable Pleasefeel free to take this personallyYou should have been the Mockingjay No onewouldve had to feed you lines I sayTrue But no one likes me she tells meThey trusted you though To get me out I remind herAnd theyre afraid of youHere maybe In the Capitol youre the one theyrescared of now Gale appears in the doorway and Johannaneatly unhooks herself and reattaches me to the morphlingdrip Your cousins not afraid of me she saysconfidentially She scoots off my bed and crosses to thedoor nudging Gales leg with her hip as she passes himAre you gorgeous We can hear her laughter as shedisappears down the hallI raise my eyebrows at him as he takes my handTerrified he mouths I laugh but it turns into a winceEasy He strokes my face as the pain ebbs Youve gotto stop running straight into troubleI know But someone blew up a mountain I answerInstead of pulling back he leans in closer searchingmy face You think Im heartlessI know youre not But I wont tell you its okay I sayNow he draws back almost impatiently Katniss whatdifference is there really between crushing our enemy in amine or blowing them out of the sky with one of Beeteesarrows The result is the sameI dont know We were under attack in Eight for onething The hospital was under attack I sayYes and those hoverplanes came from District Twohe says So by taking them out we prevented furtherattacksBut that kind of thinkingyou could turn it into anargument for killing anyone at any time You could justifysending kids into the Hunger Games to prevent the districtsfrom getting out of line I sayI dont buy that he tells meI do I reply It must be those trips to the arenaFine We know how to disagree he says Wealways have Maybe its good Between you and me wevegot District Two nowReally For a moment a feeling of triumph flares upinside me Then I think about the people on the squareWas there fighting after I was shotNot much The workers from the Nut turned on theCapitol soldiers The rebels just sat by and watched hesays Actually the whole country just sat by and watchedWell thats what they do best I sayYoud think that losing a major organ would entitle youto lie around a few weeks but for some reason my doctorswant me up and moving almost immediately Even with themorphling the internal pains severe the first few days butthen it slacks off considerably The soreness from thebruised ribs however promises to hang on for a while Ibegin to resent Johanna dipping into my morphling supplybut I still let her take whatever she likesRumors of my death have been running rampant sothey send in the team to film me in my hospital bed I showoff my stitches and impressive bruising and congratulatethe districts on their successful battle for unity Then I warnthe Capitol to expect us soonAs part of my rehabilitation I take short walksaboveground each day One afternoon Plutarch joins meand gives me an update on our current situation Now thatDistrict  has allied with us the rebels are taking a breatherfrom the war to regroup Fortifying supply lines seeing tothe wounded reorganizing their troops The Capitol like during the Dark Days finds itself completely cut off fromoutside help as it holds the threat of nuclear attack over itsenemies Unlike  the Capitol is not in a position toreinvent itself and become selfsufficientOh the city might be able to scrape along for a whilesays Plutarch Certainly there are emergency suppliesstockpiled But the significant difference between Thirteenand the Capitol are the expectations of the populaceThirteen was used to hardship whereas in the Capitol alltheyve known is Panem et CircensesWhats that I recognize Panem of course but therest is nonsenseIts a saying from thousands of years ago written in alanguage called Latin about a place called Rome heexplains Panem et Circenses translates into Bread andCircuses The writer was saying that in return for full belliesand entertainment his people had given up their politicalresponsibilities and therefore their powerI think about the Capitol The excess of food And theultimate entertainment The Hunger Games So thats whatthe districts are for To provide the bread and circusesYes And as long as that kept rolling in the Capitolcould control its little empire Right now it can provideneither at least at the standard the people are accustomedto says Plutarch We have the food and Im about toorchestrate an entertainment propo thats sure to bepopular After all everybody loves a weddingI freeze in my tracks sick at the idea of what hessuggesting Somehow staging some perverse weddingbetween Peeta and me I havent been able to face thatoneway glass since Ive been back and at my ownrequest only get updates about Peetas condition fromHaymitch He speaks very little about it Differenttechniques are being tried There will never truly be a wayto cure him And now they want me to marry Peeta for apropoPlutarch rushes to reassure me Oh no Katniss Notyour wedding Finnick and Annies All you need to do isshow up and pretend to be happy for themThats one of the few things I wont have to pretendPlutarch I tell himThe next few days bring a flurry of activity as the eventis planned The differences between the Capitol and  arethrown into sharp relief by the event When Coin sayswedding she means two people signing a piece of paperand being assigned a new compartment Plutarch meanshundreds of people dressed in finery at a threedaycelebration Its amusing to watch them haggle over thedetails Plutarch has to fight for every guest every musicalnote After Coin vetoes a dinner entertainment andalcohol Plutarch yells Whats the point of the propo if noones having any funIts hard to put a Gamemaker on a budget But even aquiet celebration causes a stir in  where they seem tohave no holidays at all When its announced that childrenare wanted to sing District s wedding song practicallyevery kid shows up Theres no shortage of volunteers tohelp make decorations In the dining hall people chatexcitedly about the eventMaybe its more than the festivities Maybe its that weare all so starved for something good to happen that wewant to be part of it It would explain whywhen Plutarch hasa fit over what the bride will wearI volunteer to take Annieback to my house in  where Cinna left a variety ofevening clothes in a big storage closet downstairs All ofthe wedding gowns he designed for me went back to theCapitol but there are some dresses I wore on the VictoryTour Im a little leery about being with Annie since all I reallyknow about her is that Finnick loves her and everybodythinks shes mad On the hovercraft ride I decide shes lessmad than unstable She laughs at odd places in theconversation or drops out of it distractedly Those greeneyes fixate on a point with such intensity that you findyourself trying to make out what she sees in the empty airSometimes for no reason she presses both her handsover her ears as if to block out a painful sound All rightshes strange but if Finnick loves her thats good enoughfor meI got permission for my prep team to come along soIm relieved of having to make any fashion decisions WhenI open the closet we all fall silent because Cinnaspresence is so strong in the flow of the fabrics ThenOctavia drops to her knees rubs the hem of a skirt againsther cheek and bursts into tears Its been so long shegasps since Ive seen anything prettyDespite reservations on Coins side that its tooextravagant and on Plutarchs side that its too drab thewedding is a smash hit The three hundred lucky guestsculled from  and the many refugees wear their everydayclothes the decorations are made from autumn foliage themusic is provided by a choir of children accompanied bythe lone fiddler who made it out of  with his instrumentSo its simple frugal by the Capitols standards It doesntmatter because nothing can compete with the beauty of thecouple It isnt about their borrowed fineryAnnie wears agreen silk dress I wore in  Finnick one of Peetas suitsthat they alteredalthough the clothes are striking Who canlook past the radiant faces of two people for whom this daywas once a virtual impossibility Dalton the cattle guy from conducts the ceremony since its similar to the oneused in his district But there are unique touches of District A net woven from long grass that covers the coupleduring their vows the touching of each others lips with saltwater and the ancient wedding song which likensmarriage to a sea voyageNo I dont have to pretend to be happy for themAfter the kiss that seals the union the cheers and atoast with apple cider the fiddler strikes up a tune that turnsevery head from  We may have been the smallestpoorest district in Panem but we know how to danceNothing has been officially scheduled at this point butPlutarch whos calling the propo from the control roommust have his fingers crossed Sure enough Greasy Saegrabs Gale by the hand and pulls him into the center of thefloor and faces off with him People pour in to join themforming two long lines And the dancing beginsIm standing off to the side clapping to the rhythmwhen a bony hand pinches me above the elbow Johannascowls at me Are you going to miss the chance to letSnow see you dancing Shes right What could spellvictory louder than a happy Mockingjay twirling around tomusic I find Prim in the crowd Since winter evenings gaveus a lot of time to practice were actually pretty goodpartners I brush off her concerns about my ribs and wetake our places in the line It hurts but the satisfaction ofhaving Snow watch me dance with my little sister reducesother feelings to dustDancing transforms us We teach the steps to theDistrict  guests Insist on a special number for the brideand groom Join hands and make a giant spinning circlewhere people show off their footwork Nothing silly joyful orfun has happened in so long This could go on all night if notfor the last event planned in Plutarchs propo One I hadntheard about but then it was meant to be a surpriseFour people wheel out a huge wedding cake from aside room Most of the guests back up making way for thisrarity this dazzling creation with bluegreen whitetippedicing waves swimming with fish and sailboats seals andsea flowers But I push my way through the crowd to confirmwhat I knew at first sight As surely as the embroiderystitches in Annies gown were done by Cinnas hand thefrosted flowers on the cake were done by PeetasThis may seem like a small thing but it speaksvolumes Haymitch has been keeping a great deal fromme The boy I last saw screaming his head off trying totear free of his restraints could never have made thisNever have had the focus kept his hands steady designedsomething so perfect for Finnick and Annie As ifanticipating my reaction Haymitch is at my sideLets you and me have a talk he saysOut in the hall away from the cameras I ask Whatshappening to himHaymitch shakes his head I dont know None of usknows Sometimes hes almost rational and then for noreason he goes off again Doing the cake was a kind oftherapy Hes been working on it for days Watchinghimhe seemed almost like beforeSo hes got the run of the place I ask The ideamakes me nervous on about five different levelsOh no He frosted under heavy guard Hes still underlock and key But Ive talked to him Haymitch saysFacetoface I ask And he didnt go nutsNo Pretty angry with me but for all the right reasonsNot telling him about the rebel plot and whatnot Haymitchpauses a moment as if deciding something He says hedlike to see youIm on a frosting sailboat tossed around by bluegreenwaves the deck shifting beneath my feet My palms pressinto the wall to steady myself This wasnt part of the plan Iwrote Peeta off in  Then I was to go to the Capitol killSnow and get taken out myself The gunshot was only atemporary setback Never was I supposed to hear thewords He says hed like to see you But now that I havetheres no way to refuseAt midnight Im standing outside the door to his cellHospital room We had to wait for Plutarch to finish gettinghis wedding footage which despite the lack of what hecalls razzledazzle hes pleased with The best thing aboutthe Capitol basically ignoring Twelve all these years is thatyou people still have a little spontaneity The audience eatsthat up Like when Peeta announced he was in love withyou or you did the trick with the berries Makes for goodtelevisionI wish I could meet with Peeta privately But theaudience of doctors has assembled behind the onewayglass clipboards ready pens poised When Haymitchgives me the okay in my earpiece I slowly open the doorThose blue eyes lock on me instantly Hes got threerestraints on each arm and a tube that can dispense aknockout drug just in case he loses control He doesnt fightto free himself though only observes me with the wary lookof someone who still hasnt ruled out that hes in thepresence of a mutt I walk over until Im standing about ayard from the bed Theres nothing to do with my hands so Icross my arms protectively over my ribs before I speakHeyHey he responds Its like his voice almost his voiceexcept theres something new in it An edge of suspicionand reproachHaymitch said you wanted to talk to me I sayLook at you for starters Its like hes waiting for meto transform into a hybrid drooling wolf right before hiseyes He stares so long I find myself casting furtive glancesat the oneway glass hoping for some direction fromHaymitch but my earpiece stays silent Youre not very bigare you Or particularly prettyI know hes been through hell and back and yetsomehow the observation rubs me the wrong way Wellyouve looked betterHaymitchs advice to back off gets muffled by Peetaslaughter And not even remotely nice To say that to meafter all Ive been throughYeah Weve all been through a lot And youre the onewho was known for being nice Not me Im doingeverything wrong I dont know why I feel so defensive Hesbeen tortured Hes been hijacked Whats wrong with meSuddenly I think I might start screaming at himIm not evensure about whatso I decide to get out of there Look Idont feel so well Maybe Ill drop by tomorrowIve just reached the door when his voice stops meKatniss I remember about the breadThe bread Our one moment of real connection beforethe Hunger GamesThey showed you the tape of me talking about it IsayNo Is there a tape of you talking about it Why didntthe Capitol use it against me he asksI made it the day you were rescued I answer Thepain in my chest wraps around my ribs like a vise Thedancing was a mistake So what do you rememberYou In the rain he says softly Digging in our trashbins Burning the bread My mother hitting me Taking thebread out for the pig but then giving it to you insteadThats it Thats what happened I say The next dayafter school I wanted to thank you But I didnt know howWe were outside at the end of the day I tried to catchyour eye You looked away And thenfor some reason Ithink you picked a dandelion I nod He does remember Ihave never spoken about that moment aloud I must haveloved you a lotYou did My voice catches and I pretend to coughAnd did you love me he asksI keep my eyes on the tiled floor Everyone says I didEveryone says thats why Snow had you tortured To breakmeThats not an answer he tells me I dont know whatto think when they show me some of the tapes In that firstarena it looked like you tried to kill me with those trackerjackersI was trying to kill all of you I say You had me treedLater theres a lot of kissing Didnt seem verygenuine on your part Did you like kissing me he asksSometimes I admit You know people are watchingus nowI know What about Gale he continuesMy angers returning I dont care about his recoverythis isnt the business of the people behind the glass Hesnot a bad kisser either I say shortlyAnd it was okay with both of us You kissing theother he asksNo It wasnt okay with either of you But I wasntasking your permission I tell himPeeta laughs again coldly dismissively Well yourea piece of work arent youHaymitch doesnt protest when I walk out Down thehall Through the beehive of compartments Find a warmpipe to hide behind in a laundry room It takes a long timebefore I get to the bottom of why Im so upset When I doits almost too mortifying to admit All those months oftaking it for granted that Peeta thought I was wonderful areover Finally he can see me for who I really am ViolentDistrustful Manipulative DeadlyAnd I hate him for itBlindsided Thats how I feel when Haymitch tells me inthe hospital I fly down the steps to Command mind racinga mile a minute and burst right into a war meetingWhat do you mean Im not going to the Capitol Ihave to go Im the Mockingjay I sayCoin barely looks up from her screen And as theMockingjay your primary goal of unifying the districtsagainst the Capitol has been achieved Dont worryif itgoes well well fly you in for the surrenderThe surrenderThatll be too late Ill miss all the fighting You needmeIm the best shot youve got I shout I dont usuallybrag about this but its got to be at least close to trueGales goingGale has shown up for training every day unlessoccupied with other approved duties We feel confident hecan manage himself in the field says Coin How manytraining sessions do you estimate youve attendedNone Thats how many Well sometimes I washunting AndI trained with Beetee down in SpecialWeaponryIts not the same Katniss says Boggs We all knowyoure smart and brave and a good shot But we needsoldiers in the field You dont know the first thing aboutexecuting orders and youre not exactly at your physicalpeakThat didnt bother you when I was in Eight Or Two forthat matter I counterYou werent originally authorized for combat in eithercase says Plutarch shooting me a look that signals Imabout to reveal too muchNo the bomber battle in  and my intervention in were spontaneous rash and definitely unauthorizedAnd both resulted in your injury Boggs reminds meSuddenly I see myself through his eyes A smallishseventeenyearold girl who cant quite catch her breathsince her ribs havent fully healed DisheveledUndisciplined Recuperating Not a soldier but someonewho needs to be looked afterBut I have to go I sayWhy asks CoinI cant very well say its so I can carry out my ownpersonal vendetta against Snow Or that the idea ofremaining here in  with the latest version of Peeta whileGale goes off to fight is unbearable But I have no shortageof reasons to want to fight in the Capitol Because ofTwelve Because they destroyed my districtThe president thinks about this a moment Considersme Well you have three weeks Its not long but you canbegin training If the Assignment Board deems you fitpossibly your case will be reviewedThats it Thats the most I can hope for I guess its myown fault I did blow off my schedule every single day unlesssomething suited me It didnt seem like much of a priorityjogging around a field with a gun with so many other thingsgoing on And now Im paying for my negligenceBack in the hospital I find Johanna in the samecircumstance and spitting mad I tell her about what Coinsaid Maybe you can train tooFine Ill train But Im going to the stinking Capitol if Ihave to kill a crew and fly there myself says JohannaProbably best not to bring that up in training I sayBut its nice to know Ill have a rideJohanna grins and I feel a slight but significant shift inour relationship I dont know that were actually friends butpossibly the word allies would be accurate Thats good Imgoing to need an allyThe next morning when we report for training at reality slaps me in the face Weve been funneled into aclass of relative beginners fourteen or fifteenyearoldswhich seems a little insulting until its obvious that theyre infar better condition than we are Gale and the other peoplealready chosen to go to the Capitol are in a differentaccelerated phase of training After we stretchwhich hurtstheres a couple of hours of strengthening exerciseswhichhurtand a fivemile runwhich kills Even with Johannasmotivational insults driving me on I have to drop out after amileIts my ribs I explain to the trainer a nononsensemiddleaged woman were supposed to address asSoldier York Theyre still bruisedWell Ill tell you Soldier Everdeen those are going totake at least another month to heal up on their own shesaysI shake my head I dont have a monthShe looks me up and down The doctors haventoffered you any treatmentIs there a treatment I ask They said they had tomend naturallyThats what they say But they could speed up theprocess if I recommend it I warn you though it isnt anyfun she tells mePlease Ive got to get to the Capitol I saySoldier York doesnt question this She scribblessomething on a pad and sends me directly back to thehospital I hesitate I dont want to miss any more trainingIll be back for the afternoon session I promise She justpurses her lipsTwentyfour needle jabs to my rib cage later Imflattened out on my hospital bed gritting my teeth to keepfrom begging them to bring back my morphling drip Itsbeen by my bed so I can take a hit as needed I haventused it lately but I kept it for Johannas sake Today theytested my blood to make sure it was clean of the painkilleras the mixture of the two drugsthe morphling andwhatevers set my ribs on firehas dangerous side effectsThey made it clear I would have a difficult couple of daysBut I told them to go aheadIts a bad night in our room Sleeps out of the questionI think I can actually smell the ring of flesh around my chestburning and Johannas fighting off withdrawal symptomsEarly on when I apologize about cutting off her morphlingsupply she waves it off saying it had to happen anywayBut by three in the morning Im the target of every colorfulbit of profanity District  has to offer At dawn she dragsme out of bed determined to get to trainingI dont think I can do it I confessYou can do it We both can Were victorsremember Were the ones who can survive anything theythrow at us she snarls at me Shes a sick greenish colorshaking like a leaf I get dressedWe must be victors to make it through the morning Ithink Im going to lose Johanna when we realize its pouringoutside Her face turns ashen and she seems to haveceased breathingIts just water It wont kill us I say She clenches herjaw and stomps out into the mud Rain drenches us as wework our bodies and then slog around the running course Ibail after a mile again and I have to resist the temptation totake off my shirt so the cold water can sizzle off my ribs Iforce down my field lunch of soggy fish and beet stewJohanna gets halfway through her bowl before it comesback up In the afternoon we learn to assemble our guns Imanage it but Johanna cant hold her hands steady enoughto fit the parts together When Yorks back is turned I helpher out Even though the rain continues the afternoons animprovement because were on the shooting range At lastsomething Im good at It takes some adjusting from a bowto a gun but by the end of the day Ive got the best score inmy classWere just inside the hospital doors when Johannadeclares This has to stop Us living in the hospitalEveryone views us as patientsIts not a problem for me I can move into our familycompartment but Johannas never been assigned oneWhen she tries to get discharged from the hospital theywont agree to let her live alone even if she comes in fordaily talks with the head doctor I think they may have puttwo and two together about the morphling and this onlyadds to their view that shes unstable She wont be aloneIm going to room with her I announce Theres somedissent but Haymitch takes our part and by bedtime wehave a compartment across from Prim and my mother whoagrees to keep an eye on usAfter I take a shower and Johanna sort of wipesherself down with a damp cloth she makes a cursoryinspection of the place When she opens the drawer thatholds my few possessions she shuts it quickly SorryI think how theres nothing in Johannas drawer but hergovernmentissued clothes That she doesnt have onething in the world to call her own Its okay You can look atmy stuff if you wantJohanna unlatches my locket studying the pictures ofGale Prim and my mother She opens the silver parachuteand pulls out the spile and slips it onto her pinkie Makesme thirsty just looking at it Then she finds the pearl Peetagave me Is thisYeah I say Made it through somehow I dont wantto talk about Peeta One of the best things about training isit keeps me from thinking of himHaymitch says hes getting better she saysMaybe But hes changed I saySo have you So have I And Finnick and Haymitchand Beetee Dont get me started on Annie Cresta Thearena messed us all up pretty good dont you think Or doyou still feel like the girl who volunteered for your sistershe asks meNo I answerThats the one thing I think my head doctor might beright about Theres no going back So we might as well geton with things She neatly returns my keepsakes to thedrawer and climbs into the bed across from me just as thelights go out Youre not afraid Ill kill you tonightLike I couldnt take you I answer Then we laughsince both our bodies are so wrecked it will be a miracle ifwe can get up the next day But we do Each morning wedo And by the end of the week my ribs feel almost likenew and Johanna can assemble her rifle without helpSoldier York gives the pair of us an approving nod aswe knock off for the day Fine job SoldiersWhen we move out of hearing Johanna mutters Ithink winning the Games was easier But the look on herface says shes pleasedIn fact were almost in good spirits when we go to thedining hall where Gales waiting to eat with me Receivinga giant serving of beef stew doesnt hurt my mood eitherFirst shipments of food arrived this morning Greasy Saetells me Thats real beef from District Ten Not any of yourwild dogDont remember you turning it down Gale tossesback We join a group that includes Delly Annie andFinnick Its something to see Finnicks transformation sincehis marriage His earlier incarnationsthe decadent Capitolheartthrob I met before the Quell the enigmatic ally in thearena the broken young man who tried to help me hold ittogetherthese have been replaced by someone whoradiates life Finnicks real charms of selfeffacing humorand an easygoing nature are on display for the first timeHe never lets go of Annies hand Not when they walk notwhen they eat I doubt he ever plans to Shes lost in somedaze of happiness There are still moments when you cantell something slips in her brain and another world blindsher to us But a few words from Finnick call her backDelly who Ive known since I was little but never gavemuch thought to has grown in my estimation She was toldwhat Peeta said to me that night after the wedding butshes not a gossip Haymitch says shes the best defender Ihave when Peeta goes off on some kind of tear about meAlways taking my side blaming his negative perceptionson the Capitols torture She has more influence on him thanany of the others do because he really does know herAnyway even if shes sugarcoating my good points Iappreciate it Frankly I could use a little sugarcoatingIm starving and the stew is so deliciousbeefpotatoes turnips and onions in a thick gravythat I have toforce myself to slow down All around the dining hall youcan feel the rejuvenating effect that a good meal can bringon The way it can make people kinder funnier moreoptimistic and remind them its not a mistake to go onliving Its better than any medicine So I try to make it lastand join in the conversation Sop up the gravy on my breadand nibble on it as I listen to Finnick telling some ridiculousstory about a sea turtle swimming off with his hat Laughbefore I realize hes standing there Directly across thetable behind the empty seat next to Johanna Watchingme I choke momentarily as the gravy bread sticks in mythroatPeeta says Delly Its so nice to see you outandaboutTwo large guards stand behind him He holds his trayawkwardly balanced on his fingertips since his wrists areshackled with a short chain between themWhats with the fancy bracelets asks JohannaIm not quite trustworthy yet says Peeta I cant evensit here without your permission He indicates the guardswith his headSure he can sit here Were old friends saysJohanna patting the space beside her The guards nodand Peeta takes a seat Peeta and I had adjoining cells inthe Capitol Were very familiar with each others screamsAnnie whos on Johannas other side does that thingwhere she covers her ears and exits reality Finnick shootsJohanna an angry look as his arm encircles AnnieWhat My head doctor says Im not supposed tocensor my thoughts Its part of my therapy repliesJohannaThe life has gone out of our little party Finnickmurmurs things to Annie until she slowly removes herhands Then theres a long silence while people pretend toeatAnnie says Delly brightly did you know it wasPeeta who decorated your wedding cake Back home hisfamily ran the bakery and he did all the icingAnnie cautiously looks across Johanna Thank youPeeta It was beautifulMy pleasure Annie says Peeta and I hear that oldnote of gentleness in his voice that I thought was goneforever Not that its directed at me But stillIf were going to fit in that walk we better go Finnicktells her He arranges both of their trays so he can carrythem in one hand while holding tightly to her with the otherGood seeing you PeetaYou be nice to her Finnick Or I might try and take heraway from you It could be a joke if the tone wasnt socold Everything it conveys is wrong The open distrust ofFinnick the implication that Peeta has his eye on Anniethat Annie could desert Finnick that I do not even existOh Peeta says Finnick lightly Dont make me sorryI restarted your heart He leads Annie away after giving mea concerned glanceWhen theyre gone Delly says in a reproachful voiceHe did save your life Peeta More than onceFor her He gives me a brief nod For the rebellionNot for me I dont owe him anythingI shouldnt rise to the bait but I do Maybe not ButMags is dead and youre still here That should count forsomethingYeah a lot of things should count for something thatdont seem to Katniss Ive got some memories I cantmake sense of and I dont think the Capitol touched themA lot of nights on the train for instance he saysAgain the implications That more happened on thetrain than did That what did happenthose nights I onlykept my sanity because his arms were around menolonger matters Everything a lie everything a way ofmisusing himPeeta makes a little gesture with his spoonconnecting Gale and me So are you two officially acouple now or are they still dragging out the starcrossedlover thingStill dragging says JohannaSpasms cause Peetas hands to tighten into fists thensplay out in a bizarre fashion Is it all he can do to keepthem from my neck I can feel the tension in Gales musclesnext to me fear an altercation But Gale simply says Iwouldnt have believed it if I hadnt seen it myselfWhats that asks PeetaYou Gale answersYoull have to be a little more specific says PeetaWhat about meThat theyve replaced you with the evilmutt version ofyourself says JohannaGale finishes his milk You done he asks me I riseand we cross to drop off our trays At the door an old manstops me because Im still clutching the rest of my gravybread in my hand Something in my expression or maybethe fact that Ive made no attempt to conceal it makes himgo easy on me He lets me stuff the bread in my mouth andmove on Gale and I are almost to my compartment whenhe speaks again I didnt expect thatI told you he hated me I sayIts the way he hates you Its sofamiliar I used to feellike that he admits When Id watch you kissing him on thescreen Only I knew I wasnt being entirely fair He cant seethatWe reach my door Maybe he just sees me as I reallyam I have to get some sleepGale catches my arm before I can disappear Sothats what youre thinking now I shrug Katniss as youroldest friend believe me when I say hes not seeing you asyou really are He kisses my cheek and goesI sit on my bed trying to stuff information from myMilitary Tactics books into my head while memories of mynights with Peeta on the train distract me After abouttwenty minutes Johanna comes in and throws herselfacross the foot of my bed You missed the best part Dellylost her temper at Peeta over how he treated you She gotvery squeaky It was like someone stabbing a mouse with afork repeatedly The whole dining hall was rivetedWhatd Peeta do I askHe started arguing with himself like he was twopeople The guards had to take him away On the goodside no one seemed to notice I finished his stew Johannarubs her hand over her protruding belly I look at the layer ofgrime under her fingernails Wonder if the people in  everbathe We spend a couple of hours quizzing each other onmilitary terms I visit my mother and Prim for a while WhenIm back in my compartment showered staring into thedarkness I finally ask Johanna could you really hear himscreamingThat was part of it she says Like the jabberjays inthe arena Only it was real And it didnt stop after an hourTick tockTick tock I whisper backRoses Wolf mutts Tributes Frosted dolphinsFriends Mockingjays Stylists MeEverything screams in my dreams tonightI throw myself into training with a vengeance Eat liveand breathe the workouts drills weapons practice lectureson tactics A handful of us are moved into an additionalclass that gives me hope I may be a contender for theactual war The soldiers simply call it the Block but thetattoo on my arm lists it as SSC short for SimulatedStreet Combat Deep in  theyve built an artificial Capitolcity block The instructor breaks us into squads of eight andwe attempt to carry out missionsgaining a positiondestroying a target searching a homeas if we were reallyfighting our way through the Capitol The things rigged sothat everything that can go wrong for you does A false steptriggers a land mine a sniper appears on a rooftop yourgun jams a crying child leads you into an ambush yoursquadron leaderwhos just a voice on the programgetshit by a mortar and you have to figure out what to do withoutorders Part of you knows its fake and that theyre not goingto kill you If you set off a land mine you hear the explosionand have to pretend to fall over dead But in other ways itfeels pretty real in therethe enemy soldiers dressed inPeacekeepers uniforms the confusion of a smoke bombThey even gas us Johanna and I are the only ones who getour masks on in time The rest of our squad gets knockedout for ten minutes And the supposedly harmless gas I tooka few lungfuls of gives me a wicked headache for the restof the dayCressida and her crew tape Johanna and me on thefiring range I know Gale and Finnick are being filmed aswell Its part of a new propos series to show the rebelspreparing for the Capitol invasion On the whole things aregoing pretty wellThen Peeta starts showing up for our morningworkouts The manacles are off but hes still constantlyaccompanied by a pair of guards After lunch I see himacross the field drilling with a group of beginners I dontknow what theyre thinking If a spat with Delly can reducehim to arguing with himself hes got no business learninghow to assemble a gunWhen I confront Plutarch he assures me that its all forthe camera Theyve got footage of Annie getting marriedand Johanna hitting targets but all of Panem is wonderingabout Peeta They need to see hes fighting for the rebelsnot for Snow And maybe if they could just get a couple ofshots of the two of us not kissing necessarily just lookinghappy to be back togetherI walk away from the conversation right then That is notgoing to happenIn my rare moments of downtime I anxiously watch thepreparations for the invasions See equipment andprovisions readied divisions assembled You can tell whensomeones received orders because theyre given a veryshort haircut the mark of a person going into battle Thereis much talk of the opening offensive which will be tosecure the train tunnels that feed up into the CapitolJust a few days before the first troops are to move outYork unexpectedly tells Johanna and me shesrecommended us for the exam and were to reportimmediately There are four parts an obstacle course thatassesses your physical condition a written tactics exam atest of weapons proficiency and a simulated combatsituation in the Block I dont even have time to get nervousfor the first three and do well but theres a backlog at theBlock Some kind of technical bug theyre working out Agroup of us exchanges information This much seems trueYou go through alone Theres no predicting what situationyoull be thrown into One boy says under his breath thathes heard its designed to target each individualsweaknessesMy weaknesses Thats a door I dont even want toopen But I find a quiet spot and try to assess what theymight be The length of the list depresses me Lack ofphysical brute force A bare minimum of training Andsomehow my standout status as the Mockingjay doesntseem to be an advantage in a situation where theyre tryingto get us to blend into a pack They could nail me to the wallon any number of thingsJohannas called three ahead of me and I give her anod of encouragement I wish I had been at the top of thelist because now Im really overthinking the whole thing Bythe time my names called I dont know what my strategyshould be Fortunately once Im in the Block a certainamount of training does kick in Its an ambush situationPeacekeepers appear almost instantly and I have to makemy way to a rendezvous point to meet up with my scatteredsquad I slowly navigate the street taking outPeacekeepers as I go Two on the rooftop to my leftanother in the doorway up ahead Its challenging but not ashard as I was expecting Theres a nagging feeling that if itstoo simple I must be missing the point Im within a coupleof buildings from my goal when things begin to heat up Ahalf dozen Peacekeepers come charging around thecorner They will outgun me but I notice something A drumof gasoline lying carelessly in the gutter This is it My testTo perceive that blowing up the drum will be the only way toachieve my mission Just as I step out to do it my squadronleader whos been fairly useless up to this point quietlyorders me to hit the ground Every instinct I have screamsfor me to ignore the voice to pull the trigger to blow thePeacekeepers skyhigh And suddenly I realize what themilitary will think my biggest weakness is From my firstmoment in the Games when I ran for that orangebackpack to the firefight in  to my impulsive race acrossthe square in  I cannot take ordersI smack into the ground so hard and fast Ill be pickinggravel out of my chin for a week Someone else blows thegas tank The Peacekeepers die I make my rendezvouspoint When I exit the Block on the far side a soldiercongratulates me stamps my hand with squad number and tells me to report to Command Almost giddy withsuccess I run through the halls skidding around cornersbounding down the steps because the elevators too slow Ibang into the room before the oddity of the situation dawnson me I shouldnt be in Command I should be getting myhair buzzed The people around the table arent freshlyminted soldiers but the ones calling the shotsBoggs smiles and shakes his head when he sees meLets see it Unsure now I hold out my stamped handYoure with me Its a special unit of sharpshooters Joinyour squad He nods over at a group lining the wall GaleFinnick Five others I dont know My squad Im not only in Iget to work under Boggs With my friends I force myself totake calm soldierly steps to join them instead of jumpingup and downWe must be important too because were inCommand and it has nothing to do with a certainMockingjay Plutarch stands over a wide flat panel in thecenter of the table Hes explaining something about thenature of what we will encounter in the Capitol Im thinkingthis is a terrible presentationbecause even on tiptoe Icant see whats on the paneluntil he hits a button Aholographic image of a block of the Capitol projects intothe airThis for example is the area surrounding one of thePeacekeepers barracks Not unimportant but not the mostcrucial of targets and yet look Plutarch enters some sortof code on a keyboard and lights begin to flash Theyre inan assortment of colors and blink at different speedsEach light is called a pod It represents a differentobstacle the nature of which could be anything from abomb to a band of mutts Make no mistake whatever itcontains is designed to either trap or kill you Some havebeen in place since the Dark Days others developed overthe years To be honest I created a fair number myselfThis program which one of our people absconded withwhen we left the Capitol is our most recent informationThey dont know we have it But even so its likely that newpods have been activated in the last few months This iswhat you will faceIm unaware that my feet are moving to the table untilIm inches from the holograph My hand reaches in andcups a rapidly blinking green lightSomeone joins me his body tense Finnick of courseBecause only a victor would see what I see so immediatelyThe arena Laced with pods controlled by GamemakersFinnicks fingers caress a steady red glow over a doorwayLadies and gentlemenHis voice is quiet but mine rings through the roomLet the Seventysixth Hunger Games beginI laugh Quickly Before anyone has time to registerwhat lies beneath the words I have just uttered Beforeeyebrows are raised objections are uttered two and twoare put together and the solution is that I should be kept asfar away from the Capitol as possible Because an angryindependently thinking victor with a layer of psychologicalscar tissue too thick to penetrate is maybe the last personyou want on your squadI dont even know why you bothered to put Finnick andme through training Plutarch I sayYeah were already the two bestequipped soldiersyou have Finnick adds cockilyDo not think that fact escapes me he says with animpatient wave Now back in line Soldiers Odair andEverdeen I have a presentation to finishWe retreat to our places ignoring the questioninglooks thrown our way I adopt an attitude of extremeconcentration as Plutarch continues nodding my head hereand there shifting my position to get a better view all thewhile telling myself to hang on until I can get to the woodsand scream Or curse Or cry Or maybe all three at onceIf this was a test Finnick and I both pass it WhenPlutarch finishes and the meetings adjourned I have a badmoment when I learn theres a special order for me But itsmerely that I skip the military haircut because they wouldlike the Mockingjay to look as much like the girl in the arenaas possible at the anticipated surrender For the camerasyou know I shrug to communicate that my hair lengths amatter of complete indifference to me They dismiss mewithout further commentFinnick and I gravitate toward each other in thehallway What will I tell Annie he says under his breathNothing I answer Thats what my mother and sisterwill be hearing from me Bad enough that we know wereheading back into a fully equipped arena No use droppingit on our loved onesIf she sees that holograph he beginsShe wont Its classified information It must be I sayAnyway its not like an actual Games Any number ofpeople will survive Were just overreacting becausewellyou know why You still want to go dont youOf course I want to destroy Snow as much as youdo he saysIt wont be like the others I say firmly trying toconvince myself as well Then the real beauty of thesituation dawns on me This time Snow will be a playertooBefore we can continue Haymitch appears He wasntat the meeting isnt thinking of arenas but something elseJohannas back in the hospitalI assumed Johanna was fine had passed her exambut simply wasnt assigned to a sharpshooters unit Sheswicked throwing an ax but about average with a gun Is shehurt What happenedIt was while she was on the Block They try to ferretout a soldiers potential weaknesses So they flooded thestreet says HaymitchThis doesnt help Johanna can swim At least I seemto remember her swimming around some in the QuarterQuell Not like Finnick of course but none of us are likeFinnick SoThats how they tortured her in the Capitol Soakedher and then used electric shocks says Haymitch In theBlock she had some kind of flashback Panicked didntknow where she was Shes back under sedation Finnickand I just stand there as if weve lost the ability to respond Ithink of the way Johanna never showers How she forcedherself into the rain like it was acid that day I had attributedher misery to the morphling withdrawalYou two should go see her Youre as close to friendsas shes got says HaymitchThat makes the whole thing worse I dont really knowwhats between Johanna and Finnick But I hardly know herNo family No friends Not so much as a token from  to setbeside her regulation clothes in her anonymous drawerNothingI better go tell Plutarch He wont be happy Haymitchcontinues He wants as many victors as possible for thecameras to follow in the Capitol Thinks it makes for bettertelevisionAre you and Beetee going I askAs many young and attractive victors as possibleHaymitch corrects himself So no Well be hereFinnick goes directly down to see Johanna but I lingeroutside a few minutes until Boggs comes out Hes mycommander now so I guess hes the one to ask for anyspecial favors When I tell him what I want to do he writesme a pass so that I can go to the woods during Reflectionprovided I stay within sight of the guards I run to mycompartment thinking to use the parachute but its so full ofugly memories Instead I go across the hall and take one ofthe white cotton bandages I brought from  SquareSturdy Just the thingIn the woods I find a pine tree and strip handfuls offragrant needles from the boughs After making a neat pilein the middle of the bandage I gather up the sides givethem a twist and tie them tightly with a length of vinemaking an applesized bundleAt the hospital room door I watch Johanna for amoment realize that most of her ferocity is in her abrasiveattitude Stripped of that as she is now theres only a slightyoung woman her wideset eyes fighting to stay awakeagainst the power of the drugs Terrified of what sleep willbring I cross to her and hold out the bundleWhats that she says hoarsely Damp edges of herhair form little spikes over her foreheadI made it for you Something to put in your drawer Iplace it in her hands Smell itShe lifts the bundle to her nose and takes a tentativesniff Smells like home Tears flood her eyesThats what I was hoping You being from Seven andall I say Remember when we met You were a treeWell brieflySuddenly she has my wrist in an iron grip You haveto kill him KatnissDont worry I resist the temptation to wrench my armfreeSwear it On something you care about she hissesI swear it On my life But she doesnt let go of myarmOn your familys life she insistsOn my familys life I repeat I guess my concern formy own survival isnt compelling enough She lets go and Irub my wrist Why do you think Im going anywaybrainlessThat makes her smile a little I just needed to hear itShe presses the bundle of pine needles to her nose andcloses her eyesThe remaining days go by in a whirl After a briefworkout each morning my squads on the shooting rangefulltime in training I practice mostly with a gun but theyreserve an hour a day for specialty weapons which means Iget to use my Mockingjay bow Gale his heavy militarizedone The trident Beetee designed for Finnick has a lot ofspecial features but the most remarkable is that he canthrow it press a button on a metal cuff on his wrist andreturn it to his hand without chasing it downSometimes we shoot at Peacekeeper dummies tobecome familiar with the weaknesses in their protectivegear The chinks in the armor so to speak If you hit fleshyoure rewarded with a burst of fake blood Our dummiesare soaked in redIts reassuring to see just how high the overall level ofaccuracy is in our group Along with Finnick and Gale thesquad includes five soldiers from  Jackson a middleagedwoman whos Boggss second in command lookskind of sluggish but can hit things the rest of us cant evensee without a scope Farsighted she says Theres a pairof sisters in their twenties named Leegwe call them Leeg and Leeg  for claritywho are so similar in uniform Icant tell them apart until I notice Leeg  has weird yellowflecks in her eyes Two older guys Mitchell and Homesnever say much but can shoot the dust off your boots at fiftyyards I see other squads that are also quite good but Idont fully understand our status until the morning Plutarchjoins usSquad FourFiveOne you have been selected for aspecial mission he begins I bite the inside of my liphoping against hope that its to assassinate Snow Wehave numerous sharpshooters but rather a dearth ofcamera crews Therefore weve handpicked the eight ofyou to be what we call our Star Squad You will be the onscreenfaces of the invasionDisappointment shock then anger run through thegroup What youre saying is we wont be in actualcombat snaps GaleYou will be in combat but perhaps not always on thefront line If one can even isolate a front line in this type ofwar says PlutarchNone of us wants that Finnicks remark is followedby a general rumble of assent but I stay silent Weregoing to fightYoure going to be as useful to the war effort aspossible Plutarch says And its been decided that youare of most value on television Just look at the effectKatniss had running around in that Mockingjay suit Turnedthe whole rebellion around Do you notice how shes theonly one not complaining Its because she understands thepower of that screenActually Katniss isnt complaining because she has nointention of staying with the Star Squad but sherecognizes the necessity of getting to the Capitol beforecarrying out any plan Still to be too compliant may arousesuspicion as wellBut its not all pretend is it I ask Thatd be a wasteof talentDont worry Plutarch tells me Youll have plenty ofreal targets to hit But dont get blown up Ive got enough onmy plate without having to replace you Now get to theCapitol and put on a good showThe morning we ship out I say goodbye to my family Ihavent told them how much the Capitols defenses mirrorthe weapons in the arena but my going off to war is awfulenough on its own My mother holds me tightly for a longtime I feel tears on her cheek something she suppressedwhen I was slated for the Games Dont worry Ill beperfectly safe Im not even a real soldier Just one ofPlutarchs televised puppets I reassure herPrim walks me as far as the hospital doors How doyou feelBetter knowing youre somewhere Snow cant reachyou I sayNext time we see each other well be free of himsays Prim firmly Then she throws her arms around myneck Be carefulI consider saying a final goodbye to Peeta decide itwould only be bad for both of us But I do slip the pearl intothe pocket of my uniform A token of the boy with the breadA hovercraft takes us to of all places  where amakeshift transportation area has been set up outside thefire zone No luxury trains this time but a cargo car packedto the limit with soldiers in their dark gray uniformssleeping with their heads on their packs After a couple ofdays travel we disembark inside one of the mountaintunnels leading to the Capitol and make the rest of the sixhourtrek on foot taking care to step only on a glowinggreen paint line that marks safe passage to the air aboveWe come out in the rebel encampment a tenblockstretch outside the train station where Peeta and I madeour previous arrivals Its already crawling with soldiersSquad  is assigned a spot to pitch its tents This areahas been secured for over a week Rebels pushed out thePeacekeepers losing hundreds of lives in the process TheCapitol forces fell back and have regrouped farther into thecity Between us lie the boobytrapped streets empty andinviting Each one will need to be swept of pods before wecan advanceMitchell asks about hoverplane bombingswe do feelvery naked pitched out in the openbut Boggs says its notan issue Most of the Capitols air fleet was destroyed in or during the invasion If it has any craft left its holding on tothem Probably so Snow and his inner circle can make alastminute escape to some presidential bunkersomewhere if needed Our own hoverplanes weregrounded after the Capitols antiaircraft missiles decimatedthe first few waves This war will be battled out on thestreets with hopefully only superficial damage to theinfrastructure and a minimum of human casualties Therebels want the Capitol just as the Capitol wanted After three days much of Squad  risks desertingout of boredom Cressida and her team take shots of usfiring They tell us were part of the disinformation team Ifthe rebels only shoot Plutarchs pods it will take the Capitolabout two minutes to realize we have the holograph Sotheres a lot of time spent shattering things that dont matterto throw them off the scent Mostly we just add to the pilesof rainbow glass thats been blown off the exteriors of thecandycolored buildings I suspect they are intercutting thisfootage with the destruction of significant Capitol targetsOnce in a while it seems a real sharpshooters services areneeded Eight hands go up but Gale Finnick and I arenever chosenIts your own fault for being so cameraready I tellGale If looks could killI dont think they quite know what to do with the three ofus particularly me I have my Mockingjay outfit with me butIve only been taped in my uniform Sometimes I use a gunsometimes they ask me to shoot with my bow and arrowsIts as if they dont want to entirely lose the Mockingjay butthey want to downgrade my role to foot soldier Since I dontcare its amusing rather than upsetting to imagine thearguments going on back in While I outwardly express discontent about our lack ofany real participation Im busy with my own agenda Eachof us has a paper map of the Capitol The city forms analmost perfect square Lines divide the map into smallersquares with letters along the top and numbers down theside to form a grid I consume this noting every intersectionand side street but its remedial stuff The commandershere are working off Plutarchs holograph Each has ahandheld contraption called a Holo that produces imageslike I saw in Command They can zoom into any area of thegrid and see what pods await them The Holos anindependent unit a glorified map really since it can neithersend nor receive signals But its far superior to my paperversionA Holo is activated by a specific commanders voicegiving his or her name Once its working it responds to theother voices in the squadron so if say Boggs were killedor severely disabled someone could take over If anyone inthe squad repeats nightlock three times in a row the Holowill explode blowing everything in a fiveyard radius skyhighThis is for security reasons in the event of capture Itsunderstood that we would all do this without hesitationSo what I need to do is steal Boggss activated Holoand clear out before he notices I think it would be easier tosteal his teethOn the fourth morning Soldier Leeg  hits amislabeled pod It doesnt unleash a swarm of muttationgnats which the rebels are prepared for but shoots out asunburst of metal darts One finds her brain Shes gonebefore the medics can reach her Plutarch promises aspeedy replacementThe following evening the newest member of oursquad arrives With no manacles No guards Strolling outof the train station with his gun swinging from the strap overhis shoulder Theres shock confusion resistance but is stamped on the back of Peetas hand in fresh ink Boggsrelieves him of his weapon and goes to make a callIt wont matter Peeta tells the rest of us Thepresident assigned me herself She decided the proposneeded some heating upMaybe they do But if Coin sent Peeta here shesdecided something else as well That Im of more use to herdead than alivePART IIITHE ASSASSINIve never really seen Boggs angry before Not whenIve disobeyed his orders or puked on him not even whenGale broke his nose But hes angry when he returns fromhis phone call with the president The first thing he does isinstruct Soldier Jackson his second in command to set upa twoperson roundtheclock guard on Peeta Then hetakes me on a walk weaving through the sprawling tentencampment until our squad is far behind usHell try and kill me anyway I say Especially hereWhere there are so many bad memories to set him offIll keep him contained Katniss says BoggsWhy does Coin want me dead now I askShe denies she does he answersBut we know its true I say And you must at leasthave a theoryBoggs gives me a long hard look before he answersHeres as much as I know The president doesnt like youShe never did It was Peeta she wanted rescued from thearena but no one else agreed It made matters worse whenyou forced her to give the other victors immunity But eventhat could be overlooked in view of how well youveperformedThen what is it I insistSometime in the near future this war will be resolvedA new leader will be chosen says BoggsI roll my eyes Boggs no one thinks Im going to bethe leaderNo They dont he agrees But youll throw support tosomeone Would it be President Coin Or someone elseI dont know Ive never thought about it I sayIf your immediate answer isnt Coin then youre athreat Youre the face of the rebellion You may have moreinfluence than any other single person says BoggsOutwardly the most youve ever done is tolerated herSo shell kill me to shut me up The minute I say thewords I know theyre trueShe doesnt need you as a rallying point now As shesaid your primary objective to unite the districts hassucceeded Boggs reminds me These current proposcould be done without you Theres only one last thing youcould do to add fire to the rebellionDie I say quietlyYes Give us a martyr to fight for says Boggs Butthats not going to happen under my watch SoldierEverdeen Im planning for you to have a long lifeWhy This kind of thinking will only bring him troubleYou dont owe me anythingBecause youve earned it he says Now get back toyour squadI know I should feel appreciative of Boggs sticking hisneck out for me but really Im just frustrated I mean howcan I steal his Holo and desert now Betraying him wascomplicated enough without this whole new layer of debt Ialready owe him for saving my lifeSeeing the cause of my current dilemma calmlypitching his tent back at our site makes me furious Whattime is my watch I ask JacksonShe squints at me in doubt or maybe shes just tryingto get my face in focus I didnt put you in the rotationWhy not I askIm not sure you could really shoot Peeta if it came toit she saysI speak up so the whole squad can hear me clearly Iwouldnt be shooting Peeta Hes gone Johannas right Itdbe just like shooting another of the Capitols mutts It feelsgood to say something horrible about him out loud inpublic after all the humiliation Ive felt since his returnWell that sort of comment isnt recommending youeither says JacksonPut her in the rotation I hear Boggs say behind meJackson shakes her head and makes a noteMidnight to four Youre on with meThe dinner whistle sounds and Gale and I line up atthe canteen Do you want me to kill him he asks bluntlyThatll get us both sent back for sure I say But eventhough Im furious the brutality of the offer rattles me I candeal with himYou mean until you take off You and your paper mapand possibly a Holo if you can get your hands on it SoGale has not missed my preparations I hope they haventbeen so obvious to the others None of them know my mindlike he does though Youre not planning on leaving mebehind are you he asksUp until this point I was But having my hunting partnerto watch my back doesnt sound like a bad idea As yourfellow soldier I have to strongly recommend you stay withyour squad But I cant stop you from coming can IHe grins No Not unless you want me to alert the restof the armySquad  and the television crew collect dinner fromthe canteen and gather in a tense circle to eat At first I thinkthat Peeta is the cause of the unease but by the end of themeal I realize more than a few unfriendly looks have beendirected my way This is a quick turnaround since Im prettysure when Peeta appeared the whole team was concernedabout how dangerous he might be especially to me But itsnot until I get a phone call through to Haymitch that IunderstandWhat are you trying to do Provoke him into anattack he asks meOf course not I just want him to leave me alone I sayWell he cant Not after what the Capitol put himthrough says Haymitch Look Coin may have sent himthere hoping hed kill you but Peeta doesnt know that Hedoesnt understand whats happened to him So you cantblame himI dont I sayYou do Youre punishing him over and over for thingsthat are out of his control Now Im not saying you shouldnthave a fully loaded weapon next to you round the clock ButI think its time you flipped this little scenario around in yourhead If youd been taken by the Capitol and hijacked andthen tried to kill Peeta is this the way he would be treatingyou demands HaymitchI fall silent It isnt It isnt how he would be treating me atall He would be trying to get me back at any cost Notshutting me out abandoning me greeting me with hostilityat every turnYou and me we made a deal to try and save himRemember Haymitch says When I dont respond hedisconnects after a curt Try and rememberThe autumn day turns from brisk to cold Most of thesquad hunker down in their sleeping bags Some sleepunder the open sky close to the heater in the center of ourcamp while others retreat to their tents Leeg  has finallybroken down over her sisters death and her muffled sobsreach us through the canvas I huddle in my tent thinkingover Haymitchs words Realizing with shame that myfixation with assassinating Snow has allowed me to ignorea much more difficult problem Trying to rescue Peeta fromthe shadowy world the hijacking has stranded him in I dontknow how to find him let alone lead him out I cant evenconceive of a plan It makes the task of crossing a loadedarena locating Snow and putting a bullet through his headlook like childs playAt midnight I crawl out of my tent and position myselfon a camp stool near the heater to take my watch withJackson Boggs told Peeta to sleep out in full view wherethe rest of us could keep an eye on him He isnt sleepingthough Instead he sits with his bag pulled up to his chestclumsily trying to make knots in a short length of rope Iknow it well Its the one Finnick lent me that night in thebunker Seeing it in his hands its like Finnicks echoingwhat Haymitch just said that Ive cast off Peeta Now mightbe a good time to begin to remedy that If I could think ofsomething to say But I cant So I dont I just let the soundsof soldiers breathing fill the nightAfter about an hour Peeta speaks up These lastcouple of years must have been exhausting for you Tryingto decide whether to kill me or not Back and forth Backand forthThat seems grossly unfair and my first impulse is tosay something cutting But I revisit my conversation withHaymitch and try to take the first tentative step in Peetasdirection I never wanted to kill you Except when I thoughtyou were helping the Careers kill me After that I alwaysthought of you asan ally Thats a good safe word Emptyof any emotional obligation but nonthreateningAlly Peeta says the word slowly tasting it FriendLover Victor Enemy Fiancee Target Mutt NeighborHunter Tribute Ally Ill add it to the list of words I use to tryto figure you out He weaves the rope in and out of hisfingers The problem is I cant tell whats real anymoreand whats made upThe cessation of rhythmic breathing suggests thateither people have woken or have never really been asleepat all I suspect the latterFinnicks voice rises from a bundle in the shadowsThen you should ask Peeta Thats what Annie doesAsk who Peeta says Who can I trustWell us for starters Were your squad saysJacksonYoure my guards he points outThat too she says But you saved a lot of lives inThirteen Its not the kind of thing we forgetIn the quiet that follows I try to imagine not being ableto tell illusion from reality Not knowing if Prim or my motherloved me If Snow was my enemy If the person across theheater saved or sacrificed me With very little effort my liferapidly morphs into a nightmare I suddenly want to tellPeeta everything about who he is and who I am and howwe ended up here But I dont know how to start WorthlessIm worthlessAt a few minutes before four Peeta turns to me againYour favorite colorits greenThats right Then I think of something to add Andyours is orangeOrange He seems unconvincedNot bright orange But soft Like the sunset I say Atleast thats what you told me onceOh He closes his eyes briefly maybe trying toconjure up that sunset then nods his head Thank youBut more words tumble out Youre a painter Youre abaker You like to sleep with the windows open You nevertake sugar in your tea And you always doubleknot yourshoelacesThen I dive into my tent before I do something stupidlike cryIn the morning Gale Finnick and I go out to shootsome glass off the buildings for the camera crew When weget back to camp Peetas sitting in a circle with thesoldiers from  who are armed but talking openly withhim Jackson has devised a game called Real or NotReal to help Peeta He mentions something he thinkshappened and they tell him if its true or imagined usuallyfollowed by a brief explanationMost of the people from Twelve were killed in the fireReal Less than nine hundred of you made it toThirteen aliveThe fire was my faultNot real President Snow destroyed Twelve the wayhe did Thirteen to send a message to the rebelsThis seems like a good idea until I realize that Ill be theonly one who can confirm or deny most of what weighs onhim Jackson breaks us up into watches She matches upFinnick Gale and me each with a soldier from  Thisway Peeta will always have access to someone who knowshim more personally Its not a steady conversation Peetaspends a long time considering even small pieces ofinformation like where people bought their soap backhome Gale fills him in on a lot of stuff about  Finnick isthe expert on both of Peetas Games as he was a mentorin the first and a tribute in the second But since Peetasgreatest confusion centers around meand not everythingcan be explained simplyour exchanges are painful andloaded even though we touch on only the most superficialof details The color of my dress in  My preference forcheese buns The name of our math teacher when we werelittle Reconstructing his memory of me is excruciatingPerhaps it isnt even possible after what Snow did to himBut it does feel right to help him tryThe next afternoon were notified that the whole squadis needed to stage a fairly complicated propo Peetasbeen right about one thing Coin and Plutarch are unhappywith the quality of footage theyre getting from the StarSquad Very dull Very uninspiring The obvious responseis that they never let us do anything but playact with ourguns However this is not about defending ourselves itsabout coming up with a usable product So today a specialblock has been set aside for filming It even has a couple ofactive pods on it One unleashes a spray of gunfire Theother nets the invader and traps them for eitherinterrogation or execution depending on the captorspreference But its still an unimportant residential blockwith nothing of strategic consequenceThe television crew means to provide a sense ofheightened jeopardy by releasing smoke bombs andadding gunfire sound effects We suit up in heavy protectivegear even the crew as if were heading into the heart ofbattle Those of us with specialty weapons are allowed totake them along with our guns Boggs gives Peeta back hisgun too although he makes sure to tell him in a loud voicethat its only loaded with blanksPeeta just shrugs Im not much of a shot anyway Heseems preoccupied with watching Pollux to the pointwhere its getting a little worrisome when he finally puzzlesit out and begins to speak with agitation Youre an Avoxarent you I can tell by the way you swallow There weretwo Avoxes with me in prison Darius and Lavinia but theguards mostly called them the redheads Theyd been ourservants in the Training Center so they arrested them too Iwatched them being tortured to death She was lucky Theyused too much voltage and her heart stopped right off Ittook days to finish him off Beating cutting off parts Theykept asking him questions but he couldnt speak he justmade these horrible animal sounds They didnt wantinformation you know They wanted me to see itPeeta looks around at our stunned faces as if waitingfor a reply When none is forthcoming he asks Real or notreal The lack of response upsets him more Real or notreal he demandsReal says Boggs At least to the best of myknowledgerealPeeta sags I thought so There was nothingshinyabout it He wanders away from the group mutteringsomething about fingers and toesI move to Gale press my forehead into the body armorwhere his chest should be feel his arm tighten around meWe finally know the name of the girl who we watched theCapitol abduct from the woods of  the fate of thePeacekeeper friend who tried to keep Gale alive This is notime to call up happy moments of remembrance They losttheir lives because of me I add them to my personal list ofkills that began in the arena and now includes thousandsWhen I look up I see it has taken Gale differently Hisexpression says that there are not enough mountains tocrush enough cities to destroy It promises deathWith Peetas grisly account fresh in our minds wecrunch through the streets of broken glass until we reachour target the block we are to take It is a real if small goalto accomplish We gather around Boggs to examine theHolo projection of the street The gunfire pod is positionedabout a third of the way down just above an apartmentawning We should be able to trigger it with bullets The netpod is at the far end almost the next corner This willrequire someone to set off the body sensor mechanismEveryone volunteers except Peeta who doesnt seem toknow quite whats going on I dont get picked I get sent toMessalla who dabs some makeup on my face for theanticipated closeupsThe squad positions itself under Boggss directionand then we have to wait for Cressida to get thecameramen in place as well Theyre both to our left withCastor toward the front and Pollux bringing up the rear sotheyll be sure not to record each other Messalla sets off acouple of smoke charges for atmosphere Since this isboth a mission and a shoot Im about to ask whos incharge my commander or my director when Cressidacalls ActionWe slowly proceed down the hazy street just like oneof our exercises in the Block Everyone has at least onesection of windows to blow out but Gales assigned thereal target When he hits the pod we take coverduckinginto doorways or flattening onto the pretty light orange andpink paving stonesas a hail of bullets sweeps back andforth over our heads After a while Boggs orders usforwardCressida stops us before we can rise since sheneeds some closeup shots We take turns reenacting ourresponses Falling to the ground grimacing diving intoalcoves We know its supposed to be serious businessbut the whole thing feels a little ridiculous Especially whenit turns out that Im not the worst actor in the squad Not by along shot Were all laughing so hard at Mitchells attempt toproject his idea of desperation which involves teethgrinding and nostrils flaring that Boggs has to reprimandusPull it together FourFiveOne he says firmly Butyou can see him suppressing a smile as hes doublecheckingthe next pod Positioning the Holo to find the bestlight in the smoky air Still facing us as his left foot stepsback onto the orange paving stone Triggering the bombthat blows off his legsIts as if in an instant a painted window shattersrevealing the ugly world behind it Laughter changes toscreams blood stains pastel stones real smoke darkensthe special effect stuff made for televisionA second explosion seems to split the air and leavesmy ears ringing But I cant make out where it came fromI reach Boggs first try to make sense of the torn fleshmissing limbs to find something to stem the red flow fromhis body Homes pushes me aside wrenching open a firstaidkit Boggs clutches my wrist His face gray with dyingand ash seems to be receding But his next words are anorder The HoloThe Holo I scramble around digging through chunksof tile slick with blood shuddering when I encounter bits ofwarm flesh Find it rammed into a stairwell with one ofBoggsCatching firePART I THE SPARKI clasp the flask between my hands even though the warmth from the tea has long since leached into the frozen air My muscles are clenched tight against the cold If a pack of wild dogs were to appear at this moment the odds of scaling a tree before they attacked are not in my favor I should get up move around and work the stiffness from my limbs But instead I sit as motionless as the rock beneath me while the dawn begins to lighten the woods I cant fight the sun I can only watch helplessly as it drags me into a day that Ive been dreading for months By noon they will all be at my new house in the Victors Village The reporters the camera crews even Effie Trinket my old escort will havemade their way to District  from the Capitol I wonder if Effie will still be wearing that silly pink wig or if shell be sporting some other unnatural color especially for the Victory Tour There will be others waiting too A staff to cater to my every need on the long train trip A prep team to beautify me for public appearances My stylist and friend Cinna who designed the gorgeous outfits that first made the audience take notice of me in the Hunger Games If it were up to me I would try to forget the Hunger Games entirely Never speak of them Pretend they were nothing but a bad dream But the Victory Tour makes that impossible Strategically placed almost midway between the annual Games it is the Capitols way of keeping the horror fresh and immediate Not only are we in the districts forced to remember the iron grip of the Capitols power each year we are forced to celebrate it And this year I am one of the starsof the show I will have to travel from district to district to stand before the cheering crowds who secretly loathe me to look down into the faces of the families whose children I have killed The sun persists in rising so I make myself stand All my joints complain and my left leg has been asleep for so long that it takes several minutes of pacing to bring the feeling back into it Ive been in the woods three hours but as Ive made no real attempt at hunting I have nothing to show for it It doesnt matter for my mother and little sister Prim anymore They can afford to buy butcher meat in town although none of us likes it any better than fresh game But my best friend Gale Hawthorne and his family will be depending on todays haul and I cant let them down I start the hourandahalf trek it will take to cover our snare line Back when we were in school we had time in the afternoons to check the line and hunt and gather and stillget back to trade in town But now that Gale has gone to work in the coal mines  and I have nothing to do all dayIve taken over the job By this time Gale will have clocked in at themines taken the stomachchurning elevator ride into the depths of the earth and be pounding away at a coal seam I know what its like down there Every year in school as part of our training my class had to tour the mines When I was little it was just unpleasant The claustrophobic tunnels foul air suffocating darkness on all sides But after my father and several other miners were killed in an explosion I could barely force myself onto the elevator The annual trip became an enormous source of anxiety Twice I made myself so sick in anticipation of it that my mother kept me home because she thought I had contracted the flu Ithink of Gale who is only really alive in the woods with its fresh air and sunlight and clean flowing water I dont know how he stands it Well  yes I do He stands it because its the way to feed his mother and two younger brothers and sister And here I am with buckets of money far more than enough to feed both our families now and he wont take a single coin Its even hard for him to let me bring in meat although hed surely have kept my mother and Prim supplied if Id been killed in the Games I tell him hes doing me a favor that it drives me nuts to sit around all day Even so I never drop off the game while hes at home Which is easy since he works twelve hours a day The only time I really get to see Gale now is on Sundays when we meet up in the woods to hunt together Its still the best day of the week but its not like it used to be before when we could tell each other anything The Games have spoiled even that I keephoping that as time passes well regain the ease between us but part of me knows its futile Theres no going back I get a good haul from the traps  eight rabbits two squirrels and a beaver that swam into a wire contraption Gale designed himself Hes something of a whiz with snares rigging them to bent saplings so they pull the kill out of the reach of predators balancing logs on delicate stick triggers weaving inescapable baskets to capture fish As I go along carefully resetting each snare I know I can never quite replicate his eye for balance his instinct for where the prey will cross the path Its more than experience Its a natural gift Like the way I can shoot at an animal in almost complete darkness and still take it down with one arrow By the time I make it back to the fence that surrounds District  the sun is well up As always I listen a moment but theres no telltale hum of electrical current running through the chainlink There hardly ever is even though the thing is supposed to be charged fulltime I wriggle through the opening at the bottom of the fence and come up in the Meadow just a stones throw from my home My old home We still get to keep it since officially its the designated dwelling of my mother and sister If I should drop dead right now they would have to return to it But at present theyre bothhappily installed in the new house in the Victors Village and Im the only one who uses the squat little place where I was raised To me its my real home I go there now to switch my clothes Exchange my fathers old leather jacket for a fine wool coat that always seems too tight in the shoulders Leave my soft worn hunting boots for a pair of expensive machinemade shoes that my mother thinks are more appropriate for someone of my status Ive alreadystowed my bow and arrows in a hollow log in the woods Although time is ticking away I allow myself a few minutes to sit in the kitchen It has an abandoned quality with no fire on the hearth no cloth on the table I mourn my old life here We barely scraped by but I knew where I fit in I knew what my place was in the tightly interwoven fabric that was our life I wish I could go back to it because in retrospect it seems so secure compared with now when I am so rich and so famous and so hated by the authorities in the Capitol A wailing at the back door demands my attention I open it to find Buttercup Prims scruffy old tomcat He dislikes the new house almost as much as I do and always leaves it when my sisters at school Weve never been particularly fond of each other but now we have this new bond I let him in feed him a chunk of beaver fat and even rub him between the ears for a bit Youre hideous youknow that right I ask him Buttercup nudges my hand for more petting but we have to go Come on you I scoop him up with one hand grab my game bag with the other and haul them both out onto the street The cat springs free and disappears under a bush The shoes pinch my toes as I crunch along the cinder street Cutting down alleys and through backyards gets me to Gales house in minutes His mother Hazelle sees me through the window where shes bent over the kitchen sink She dries her hands on her apron and disappears to meet me at the door I like Hazelle Respect her The explosion that killed my father took out her husband as well leaving her with three boys and a baby due any day Less than a week after she gave birth she was out hunting the streets for work The mines werent an option what with a baby to look after but she managed to get laundry from some of the merchants in townAt fourteen Gale the eldest of the kids became the main supporter of the family He was already signed up for tesserae which entitled them to a meager supply of grain and oil in exchange for his entering his name extra times in the drawing to become a tribute On top of that even back then he was a skilled trapper But it wasnt enough to keep a family of five without Hazelle working her fingers to the bone on that washboard In winter her hands got so red and cracked they bled at the slightest provocation Still would if it wasnt for a salve my mother concocted But they are determined Hazelle and Gale that the other boys twelve yearold Rory andtenyearold Vick and the baby fouryearold Posy will never have to sign up for tesserae Hazelle smiles when she sees the game She takes the beaver by the tail feeling itsweight Hes going to make a nice stew Unlike Gale she has no problem with our hunting arrangement Good pelt too I answer Its comforting here with Hazelle Weighing the merits of the game just as we always have She pours me a mug of herb tea which I wrap my chilled fingers around gratefully You know when I get back from the tour I was thinking I might take Rory out with me sometimes After school Teach him to shoot Hazelle nods Thatd be good Gale means to but hes only got his Sundays and I think he likes saving those for you I cant stop the redness that floods my cheeks Its stupid of course Hardly anybody knows me better than Hazelle Knows the bond I share with Gale Im sure plenty of people assumed that wed eventually get married even if I never gave it any thought But that was before the Games Before my fellow tribute Peeta Mellark announced he was madly in love with me Our romancebecame a key strategy for our survival in the arena Only it wasnt just a strategy for Peeta Im not sure what it was for me But I know now it was nothing but painful for Gale My chest tightens as I think about how on the Victory Tour Peeta and I will have to present ourselves as lovers again I gulp my tea even though its too hot and push back from the table I better get going Make myself presentable for the cameras Hazelle hugs me Enjoy the food Absolutely I say My next stop is the Hob where Ive traditionally done the bulk of my trading Years ago it was a warehouse to store coal but when it fell into disuse it became a meeting place for illegal trades and then blossomed into a fulltime black market If it attracts a somewhat criminal element then I belong here I guess Hunting in the woods surrounding District  violates at least a dozen laws and is punishable by death Although theynever mention it I owe the people who frequent the Hob Gale told me that Greasy Sae the old woman who serves up soup started a collection to sponsor Peeta and me during the Games It was supposed to be just a Hob thing but a lot of other people heard about it and chipped in I dont know exactly how much it was and the price of any gift in the arena was exorbitant But for all I know it made the difference between my life and death Its still odd to drag open the front door with an empty game bag with nothing to trade and instead feel the heavy pocket of coins against my hip I try to hit as many stalls as possible spreading out my purchases of coffee buns eggs yarn and oil As an afterthought I buy three bottles of white liquor from a onearmed woman named Ripper a victim of a mine accident who was smart enough to find a way to stay alive The liquor isnt for my family Its for Haymitchwho acted as mentor for Peeta and me in the Games Hes surly violent and drunk most of the time But he did his job  more than his jobbecause for the first time in history two tributes were allowed to win So no matter who Haymitch is I owe him too And thats for always Im getting the white liquor because a few weeks ago he ran out and there was none for sale and he had a withdrawal shaking and screaming at terrifying things only he could see He scared Prim to death and frankly it wasnt much fun for me to see him like that either Ever since then Ive been sort of stockpiling the stuff just in case theres a shortage again Cray our Head Peacekeeper frowns when he sees me with the bottles Hes an older man with a few strands of silver hair combed sideways above his bright red face That stuffs too strong for you girl He should know Next to Haymitch Cray drinks more than anyone Ive ever met Aw mymother uses it in medicines I say indifferently Well itd kill just about anything he says and slaps down a coin for a bottle When I reach Greasy Saes stall I boost myself up to sit on the counter and order some soup which looks to be some kind of gourd and bean mixture A Peacekeeper named Darius comes up and buys a bowl while Im eating As law enforcers go hes one of my favorites Never really throwing his weight around usually good for a joke Hes probably in his twenties but he doesnt seem much older than I do Something about his smile his red hair that sticks out every which way gives him a boyish quality Arent you supposed to be on a train he asks me Theyre collecting me at noon I answerShouldnt you look better he asks in a loud whisper I cant help smiling at his teasing in spite of my mood Maybea ribbon in your hair or something He flicks my braid with his hand and I brush him away Dont worry By the time they get through with me Ill be unrecognizable I say Good he says Lets show a little district pride for a change Miss Everdeen Hm He shakes his head at Greasy Sae in mock disapproval and walks off to join his friends Ill want that bowl back Greasy Sae calls after him but since shes laughing she doesnt sound particularly stern Gale going to see you off she asks me No he wasnt on the list I say I saw him Sunday though Think hed have made the list Him being your cousin and all she says wryly Its just one more part of the lie the Capitol has concocted When Peeta and I made it into the final eight in the Hunger Games they sent reporters to do personal stories about us When they asked about my friends everyone directed them to Gale But it wouldnt do what with the romance I was playing out inthe arena to have my best friend be Gale He was too handsome too male and not the least bit willing to smile and play nice for the cameras We do resemble each other though quite a bit We have that Seam look Dark straight hair olive skin gray eyes So some genius made him my cousin I didnt know about it until we were already home on the platform at the train station and my mother said Your cousins can hardly wait to see you Then I turned and saw Gale and Hazelle and all the kids waiting for me so what could I do but go along Greasy Sae knows were not related but even some of the people who have known us for years seem to have forgotten I just cant wait for the whole thing to be over I whisper I know says Greasy Sae But youve got to go through it to get to the end of it Better not be late A light snow starts to fall as I make my way to the Victors Village Its about a halfmile walk from the square in thecenter of town but it seems like another world entirely Its a separate community built around a beautiful green dotted with flowering bushes There are twelve houses each large enough to hold ten of the one I was raised in Nine stand empty as they always have The three in use belong to Haymitch Peeta and me The houses inhabited by my family and Peeta give off a warm glow of life Lit windows smoke from the chimneys bunches of brightly colored corn affixed to the front doors as decoration for the upcoming Harvest Festival However Haymitchs house despite the care taken by the groundskeeper exudes an air of abandonment and neglect I brace myself at his front door knowing it will be foul then push inside My nose immediately wrinkles in disgust Haymitch refuses to let anyone in to clean and does a poor jobekeepers line theroof across from our former hideout Shells are launchedinto the row of apartments setting off the chain ofexplosions we heard and the building collapses into rubbleand dustNow we cut to a live feed A reporter stands on the roofwith the Peacekeepers Behind her the apartment blockburns Firefighters try to control the blaze with water hosesWe are pronounced deadFinally a bit of luck says HomesI guess hes right Certainly its better than having theCapitol in pursuit of us But I just keep imagining how thiswill be playing back in  Where my mother and PrimHazelle and the kids Annie Haymitch and a whole lot ofpeople from  think that they have just seen us dieMy father He just lost my sister and now says LeegWe watch as they play the footage over and overRevel in their victory especially over me Break away to doa montage of the Mockingjays rise to rebel powerI thinktheyve had this part prepared for a while because itseems pretty polishedand then go live so a couple ofreporters can discuss my welldeserved violent end Laterthey promise Snow will make an official statement Thescreen fades back to a glowThe rebels made no attempt to break in during thebroadcast which leads me to believe they think its true Ifthats so we really are on our ownSo now that were dead whats our next move asksGaleIsnt it obvious No one even knew Peeta hadregained consciousness I dont know how long hes beenwatching but by the look of misery on his face long enoughto see what happened on the street How he went madtried to bash my head in and hurled Mitchell into the podHe painfully pushes himself up to a sitting position anddirects his words to GaleOur next moveis to kill meThat makes two requests for Peetas death in less thanan hourDont be ridiculous says JacksonI just murdered a member of our squad shoutsPeetaYou pushed him off you You couldnt have known hewould trigger the net at that exact spot says Finnick tryingto calm himWho cares Hes dead isnt he Tears begin to rundown Peetas face I didnt know Ive never seen myselflike that before Katniss is right Im the monster Im themutt Im the one Snow has turned into a weaponIts not your fault Peeta says FinnickYou cant take me with you Its only a matter of timebefore I kill someone else Peeta looks around at ourconflicted faces Maybe you think its kinder to just dumpme somewhere Let me take my chances But thats thesame thing as handing me over to the Capitol Do you thinkyoud be doing me a favor by sending me back to SnowPeeta Back in Snows hands Tortured and tormenteduntil no bits of his former self will ever emerge againFor some reason the last stanza to The HangingTree starts running through my head The one where theman wants his lover dead rather than have her face the evilthat awaits her in the worldAre you are youComing to the treeWear a necklace of rope side by side withmeStrange things did happen hereNo stranger would it beIf we met up at midnight in the hanging treeIll kill you before that happens says Gale IpromisePeeta hesitates as if considering the reliability of thisoffer and then shakes his head Its no good What ifyoure not there to do it I want one of those poison pills likethe rest of you haveNightlock Theres one pill back at camp in its specialslot on the sleeve of my Mockingjay suit But theres anotherin the breast pocket of my uniform Interesting that theydidnt issue one to Peeta Perhaps Coin thought he mighttake it before he had the opportunity to kill me Its unclear ifPeeta means hed finish himself off now to spare us havingto murder him or only if the Capitol took him prisoneragain In the state hes in I expect it would be sooner ratherthan later It would certainly make things easier on the restof us Not to have to shoot him It would certainly simplify theproblem of dealing with his homicidal episodesI dont know if its the pods or the fear or watchingBoggs die but I feel the arena all around me Its as if Ivenever left really Once again Im battling not only for my ownsurvival but for Peetas as well How satisfying howentertaining it would be for Snow to have me kill him Tohave Peetas death on my conscience for whatever is left ofmy lifeIts not about you I say Were on a mission Andyoure necessary to it I look to the rest of the group Thinkwe might find some food hereBesides the medical kit and cameras we have nothingbut our uniforms and our weaponsHalf of us stay to guard Peeta or keep an eye out forSnows broadcast while the others hunt for something toeat Messalla proves most valuable because he lived in anear replica of this apartment and knows where peoplewould be most likely to stash food Like how theres astorage space concealed by a mirrored panel in thebedroom or how easy it is to pop out the ventilation screenin the hallway So even though the kitchen cupboards arebare we find over thirty canned goods and several boxesof cookiesThe hoarding disgusts the soldiers raised in  Isntthis illegal says Leeg On the contrary in the Capitol youd be consideredstupid not to do it says Messalla Even before theQuarter Quell people were starting to stock up on scarcesuppliesWhile others went without says Leeg Right says Messalla Thats how it works hereFortunately or we wouldnt have dinner says GaleEverybody grab a canSome of our company seem reluctant to do this but itsas good a method as any Im really not in the mood to divvyup everything into eleven equal parts factoring in age bodyweight and physical output I poke around in the pile aboutto settle on some cod chowder when Peeta holds out acan to me HereI take it not knowing what to expect The label readsLamb StewI press my lips together at the memories of raindripping through stones my inept attempts at flirting andthe aroma of my favorite Capitol dish in the chilly air Sosome part of it must still be in his head too How happyhow hungry how close we were when that picnic basketarrived outside our cave Thanks I pop open the top Iteven has dried plums I bend the lid and use it as amakeshift spoon scooping a bit into my mouth Now thisplace tastes like the arena tooWere passing around a box of fancy creamfilledcookies when the beeping starts again The seal of Panemlights up on the screen and remains there while the anthemplays And then they begin to show images of the dead justas they did with the tributes in the arena They start with thefour faces of our TV crew followed by Boggs GaleFinnick Peeta and me Except for Boggs they dontbother with the soldiers from  either because they haveno idea who they are or because they know they wontmean anything to the audience Then the man himselfappears seated at his desk a flag draped behind him thefresh white rose gleaming in his lapel I think he might haverecently

ridding the country of the menacecalled the Mockingjay With my death he predicts a turningof the tide in the war since the demoralized rebels have noone left to follow And what was I really A poor unstablegirl with a small talent with a bow and arrow Not a greatthinker not the mastermind of the rebellion merely a faceplucked from the rabble because I had caught the nationsattention with my antics in the Games But necessary sovery necessary because the rebels have no real leaderamong themSomewhere in District  Beetee hits a switchbecause now its not President Snow but President Coinwhos

Thegrace period will be brief Once they dig through thoseashes and come up missing eleven bodies theyll know weescapedWe can get a head start on them at least I saySuddenly Im so tired All I want is to lie down on a nearbygreen plush sofa and go to sleep To cocoon myself in acomforter made of rabbit fur and goose down Instead I pullout the Holo and insist that Jackson talk me through themost basic commandswhich are really about entering thecoordinates of the nearest map grid intersectionso that Ican at least begin to operate the thing myself As the Holoprojects our surroundings I feel my heart sink even furtherWe must be moving closer to crucial targets because thenumber of pods has noticeably increased How can wepossibly move forward into this bouquet of blinking lightswithout detection We cant And if we cant we aretrapped like birds in a net I decide its best not to adoptsome sort of superior attitude when Im with these peopleEspecially when my eyes keep drifting to that green sofaSo I say Any ideasWhy dont we start by ruling out possibilities saysFinnick The street is not a possibilityThe rooftops are just as bad as the street says LeegWe still might have a chance to withdraw go back theway we came says Homes But that would mean a failedmissionA pang of guilt hits me since Ive fabricated saidmission It was never intended for all of us to go forwardYou just had the misfortune to be with meWell thats a moot point Were with you now saysJackson So we cant stay put We cant move up Wecant move laterally I think that just leaves one optionUnderground says GaleUnderground Which I hate Like mines and tunnelsand  Underground where I dread dying which is stupidbecause even if I die aboveground the next thing theyll dois bury me underground anywayThe Holo can show subterranean as well as streetlevelpods I see that when we go underground the cleandependable lines of the street plan are interlaced with atwisting turning mess of tunnels The pods look lessnumerous thoughTwo doors down a vertical tube connects our row ofapartments to the tunnels To reach the tube apartment wewill need to squeeze through a maintenance shaft that runsthe length of the building We can enter the shaft through theback of a closet space on the upper floorOkay then Lets make it look like weve never beenhere I say We erase all signs of our stay Send the emptycans down a trash chute pocket the full ones for later flipsofa cushions smeared with blood wipe traces of gel fromthe tiles Theres no fixing the latch on the front door but welock a second bolt which will at least keep the door fromswinging open on contactFinally theres only Peeta to contend with He plantshimself on the blue sofa refusing to budge Im not goingIll either disclose your position or hurt someone elseSnows people will find you says FinnickThen leave me a pill Ill only take it if I have to saysPeetaThats not an option Come along says JacksonOr youll what Shoot me asks PeetaWell knock you out and drag you with us saysHomes Which will both slow us down and endanger usStop being noble I dont care if I die He turns to mepleading now Katniss please Dont you see I want to beout of thisThe trouble is I do see Why cant I just let him go Sliphim a pill pull the trigger Is it because I care too muchabout Peeta or too much about letting Snow win Have Iturned him into a piece in my private Games Thatsdespicable but Im not sure its beneath me If its true itwould be kindest to kill Peeta here and now But for betteror worse I am not motivated by kindness Were wastingtime Are you coming voluntarily or do we knock you outPeeta buries his face in his hands for a few momentsthen rises to join usShould we free his hands asks Leeg No Peeta growls at her drawing his cuffs in close tohis bodyNo I echo But I want the key Jackson passes itover without a word I slip it into my pants pocket where itclicks against the pearlWhen Homes pries open the small metal door to themaintenance shaft we encounter another problem Theresno way the insect shells will be able to fit through the narrowpassage Castor and Pollux remove them and detachemergency backup cameras Each is the size of a shoebox and probably works about as well Messalla cant thinkof anywhere better to hide the bulky shells so we end updumping them in the closet Leaving such an easy trail tofollow frustrates me but what else can we doEven going single file holding our packs and gear outto the side its a tight fit We sidestep our way past the firstapartment and break into the second In this apartmentone of the bedrooms has a door marked utility instead of abathroom Behind the door is the room with the entrance tothe tubeMessalla frowns at the wide circular cover for amoment returning to his own fussy world Its why no oneever wants the center unit Workmen coming and goingwhenever and no second bath But the rents considerablycheaper Then he notices Finnicks amused expressionand adds Never mindThe tube covers simple to unlatch A wide ladder withrubber treads on the steps allows for a swift easy descentinto the bowels of the city We gather at the foot of theladder waiting for our eyes to adjust to the dim strips oflights breathing in the mixture of chemicals mildew andsewagePollux pale and sweaty reaches out and latches on toCastors wrist Like he might fall over if there isnt someoneto steady himMy brother worked down here after he became anAvox says Castor Of course Who else would they get tomaintain these dank evilsmelling passages mined withpods Took five years before we were able to buy his wayup to ground level Didnt see the sun onceUnder better conditions on a day with fewer horrorsand more rest someone would surely know what to sayInstead we all stand there for a long time trying to formulatea responseFinally Peeta turns to Pollux Well then you justbecame our most valuable asset Castor laughs andPollux manages a smileWere halfway down the first tunnel when I realize whatwas so remarkable about the exchange Peeta soundedlike his old self the one who could always think of the rightthing to say when nobody else could Ironic encouraging alittle funny but not at anyones expense I glance back athim as he trudges along under his guards Gale andJackson his eyes fixed on the ground his shouldershunched forward So dispirited But for a moment he wasreally herePeeta called it right Pollux turns out to be worth tenHolos There is a simple network of wide tunnels thatdirectly corresponds to the main street plan aboveunderlying the major avenues and cross streets Its calledthe Transfer since small trucks use it to deliver goodsaround the city During the day its many pods aredeactivated but at night its a minefield However hundredsof additional passages utility shafts train tracks anddrainage tubes form a multilevel maze Pollux knows detailsthat would lead to disaster for a newcomer like whichoffshoots might require gas masks or have live wires orrats the size of beavers He alerts us to the gush of waterthat sweeps through the sewers periodically anticipatesthe time the Avoxes will be changing shifts leads us intodamp obscure pipes to dodge the nearly silent passage ofcargo trains Most important he has knowledge of thecameras There arent many down in this gloomy mistyplace except in the Transfer But we keep well out of theirwayUnder Polluxs guidance we make good timeremarkable time if you compare it to our abovegroundtravel After about six hours fatigue takes over Its three inthe morning so I figure we still have a few hours before ourbodies are discovered missing they search through therubble of the whole block of apartments in case we tried toescape through the shafts and the hunt beginsWhen I suggest we rest no one objects Pollux finds asmall warm room humming with machines loaded withlevers and dials He holds up his fingers to indicate wemust be gone in four hours Jackson works out a guardschedule and since Im not on the first shift I wedge myselfin the tight space between Gale and Leeg  and go right tosleepIt seems like only minutes later when Jackson shakesme awake tells me Im on watch Its six oclock and in onehour we must be on our way Jackson tells me to eat a canof food and keep an eye on Pollux whos insisted on beingon guard the entire night He cant sleep down here I dragmyself into a state of relative alertness eat a can of potatoand bean stew and sit against the wall facing the doorPollux seems wide awake Hes probably been relivingthose five years of imprisonment all night I get out the Holoand manage to input our grid coordinates and scan thetunnels As expected more pods are registering the closerwe move toward the center of the Capitol For a whilePollux and I click around on the Holo seeing what traps liewhere When my head begins to spin I hand it over to himand lean back against the wall I look down at the sleepingsoldiers crew and friends and I wonder how many of uswill ever see the sun againWhen my eyes fall on Peeta whose head rests right bymy feet I see hes awake I wish I could read whats goingon in his mind that I could go in and untangle the mess oflies Then I settle for something I can accomplishHave you eaten I ask A slight shake of his headindicates he hasnt I open a can of chicken and rice soupand hand it to him keeping the lid in case he tries to slit hiswrists with it or something He sits up and tilts the canchugging back the soup without really bothering to chew itThe bottom of the can reflects the lights from the machinesand I remember something thats been itching at the backof my mind since yesterday Peeta when you asked aboutwhat happened to Darius and Lavinia and Boggs told youit was real you said you thought so Because there wasnothing shiny about it What did you meanOh I dont know exactly how to explain it he tells meIn the beginning everything was just complete confusionNow I can sort certain things out I think theres a patternemerging The memories they altered with the trackerjacker venom have this strange quality about them Liketheyre too intense or the images arent stable Youremember what it was like when we were stungTrees shattered There were giant colored butterfliesI fell in a pit of orange bubbles I think about it Shinyorange bubblesRight But nothing about Darius or Lavinia was likethat I dont think theyd given me any venom yet he saysWell thats good isnt it I ask If you can separatethe two then you can figure out whats trueYes And if I could grow wings I could fly Only peoplecant grow wings he says Real or not realReal I say But people dont need wings to surviveMockingjays do He finishes the soup and returns thecan to meIn the fluorescent light the circles under his eyes looklike bruises Theres still time You should sleepUnresisting he lies back down but just stares at the needleon one of the dials as it twitches from side to side Slowlyas I would with a wounded animal my hand stretches outand brushes a wave of hair from his forehead He freezesat my touch but doesnt recoil So I continue to gentlysmooth back his hair Its the first time I have voluntarilytouched him since the last arenaYoure still trying to protect me Real or not real hewhispersReal I answer It seems to require more explanationBecause thats what you and I do Protect each otherAfter a minute or so he drifts off to sleepShortly before seven Pollux and I move among theothers rousing them There are the usual yawns and sighsthat accompany waking But my ears are picking upsomething else too Almost like a hissing Perhaps its onlysteam escaping a pipe or the faroff whoosh of one of thetrainsI hush the group to get a better read on it Theres ahissing yes but its not one extended sound More likemultiple exhalations that form words A single wordEchoing throughout the tunnels One word One nameRepeated over and over againKatnissThe grace period has ended Perhaps Snow had themdigging through the night As soon as the fire died downanyway They found Boggss remains briefly felt reassuredand then as the hours went by without further trophiesbegan to suspect At some point they realized that theyhad been tricked And President Snow cant tolerate beingmade to look like a fool It doesnt matter whether theytracked us to the second apartment or assumed we wentdirectly underground They know we are down here nowand theyve unleashed something a pack of muttsprobably bent on finding meKatniss I jump at the proximity of the sound Lookfrantically for its source bow loaded seeking a target to hitKatniss Peetas lips are barely moving but theres nodoubt the name came out of him Just when I thought heseemed a little better when I thought he might be inchinghis way back to me here is proof of how deep Snowspoison went Katniss Peetas programmed to respond tothe hissing chorus to join in the hunt Hes beginning to stirTheres no choice I position my arrow to penetrate hisbrain Hell barely feel a thing Suddenly hes sitting upeyes wide in alarm short of breath Katniss He whips hishead toward me but doesnt seem to notice my bow thewaiting arrow Katniss Get out of hereI hesitate His voice is alarmed but not insane WhyWhats making that soundI dont know Only that it has to kill you says PeetaRun Get out GoAfter my own moment of confusion I conclude I do nothave to shoot him Relax my bowstring Take in the anxiousfaces around me Whatever it is its after me It might be agood time to split upBut were your guard says JacksonAnd your crew adds CressidaIm not leaving you Gale saysI look at the crew armed with nothing but cameras andclipboards And theres Finnick with two guns and a tridentI suggest that he give one of his guns to Castor Eject theblank cartridge from Peetas load it with a real one andarm Pollux Since Gale and I have our bows we hand ourguns over to Messalla and Cressida Theres no time toshow them anything but how to point and pull the trigger butin close quarters that might be enough Its better thanbeing defenseless Now the only one without a weapon isPeeta but anyone whispering my name with a bunch ofmutts doesnt need one anywayWe leave the room free of everything but our scentTheres no way to erase that at the moment Im guessingthats how the hissing things are tracking us because wehavent left much of a physical trail The mutts noses will beabnormally keen but possibly the time we spent sloggingthrough water in drainpipes will help throw themOutside the hum of the room the hissing becomesmore distinct But its also possible to get a better sense ofthe mutts location Theyre behind us still a fair distanceSnow probably had them released underground near theplace where he found Boggss body Theoretically weshould have a good lead on them although theyre certainto be much faster than we are My mind wanders to thewolflike creatures in the first arena the monkeys in theQuarter Quell the monstrosities Ive witnessed on televisionover the years and I wonder what form these mutts willtake Whatever Snow thinks will scare me the mostPollux and I have worked out a plan for the next leg ofour journey and since it heads away from the hissing I seeno reason to alter it If we move swiftly maybe we canreach Snows mansion before the mutts reach us Buttheres a sloppiness that comes with speed the poorlyplaced boot that results in a splash the accidental clang ofa gun against a pipe even my own commands issued tooloudly for discretionWeve covered about three more blocks via anoverflow pipe and a section of neglected train track whenthe screams begin Thick guttural Bouncing off the tunnelwallsAvoxes says Peeta immediately Thats whatDarius sounded like when they tortured himThe mutts must have found them says CressidaSo theyre not just after Katniss says Leeg Theyll probably kill anyone Its just that they wont stopuntil they get to her says Gale After his hours studyingwith Beetee he is most likely rightAnd here I am again With people dying because ofme Friends allies complete strangers losing their lives forthe Mockingjay Let me go on alone Lead them off Illtransfer the Holo to Jackson The rest of you can finish themissionNo ones going to agree to that says Jackson inexasperationWere wasting time says FinnickListen Peeta whispersThe screams have stopped and in their absence myname has rebounded startling in its proximity Its below aswell as behind us now KatnissI nudge Pollux on the shoulder and we start to runTrouble is we had planned to descend to a lower level butthats out now When we come to the steps leading downPollux and I are scanning for a possible alternative on theHolo when I start gaggingMasks on orders JacksonTheres no need for masks Everyone is breathing thesame air Im the only one losing my stew because Im theonly one reacting to the odor Drifting up from the stairwellCutting through the sewage Roses I begin to trembleI swerve away from the smell and stumble right outonto the Transfer Smooth pastelcolored tiled streets justlike the ones above but bordered by white brick wallsinstead of homes A roadway where delivery vehicles candrive with ease without the congestion of the CapitolEmpty now of everything but us I swing up my bow andblow up the first pod with an explosive arrow which kills thenest of flesheating rats inside Then I sprint for the nextintersection where I know one false step will cause theground beneath our feet to disintegrate feeding us intosomething labeled Meat Grinder I shout a warning to theothers to stay with me I plan for us to skirt around thecorner and then detonate the Meat Grinder but anotherunmarked pod lies in waitIt happens silently I would miss it entirely if Finnickdidnt pull me to a stop KatnissI whip back around arrow poised for flight but whatcan be done Two of Gales arrows already lie uselessbeside the wide shaft of golden light that radiates fromceiling to floor Inside Messalla is as still as a statuepoised up on the ball of one foot head tilted back heldcaptive by the beam I cant tell if hes yelling although hismouth is stretched wide We watch utterly helpless as theflesh melts off his body like candle waxCant help him Peeta starts shoving people forwardCant Amazingly hes the only one still functional enoughto get us moving I dont know why hes in control when heshould be flipping out and bashing my brains in but thatcould happen any second At the pressure of his handagainst my shoulder I turn away from the grisly thing thatwas Messalla I make my feet go forward fast so fast that Ican barely skid to a stop before the next intersectionA spray of gunfire brings down a shower of plaster Ijerk my head from side to side looking for the pod before Iturn and see the squad of Peacekeepers pounding downthe Transfer toward us With the Meat Grinder pod blockingour way theres nothing to do but fire back They outnumberus two to one but weve still got six original members of theStar Squad who arent trying to run and shoot at the sametimeFish in a barrel I think as blossoms of red stain theirwhite uniforms Threequarters of them are down and deadwhen more begin to pour in from the side of the tunnel thesame one I flung myself through to get away from the smellfrom theThose arent PeacekeepersThey are white fourlimbed about the size of a fullgrownhuman but thats where the comparisons stopNaked with long reptilian tails arched backs and headsthat jut forward They swarm over the Peacekeepers livingand dead clamp on to their necks with their mouths and ripoff the helmeted heads Apparently having a Capitolpedigree is as useless here as it was in  It seems totake only seconds before the Peacekeepers aredecapitated The mutts fall to their bellies and skitter towardus on all foursThis way I shout hugging the wall and making asharp right turn to avoid the pod When everyones joinedme I fire into the intersection and the Meat Grinderactivates Huge mechanical teeth burst through the streetand chew the tile to dust That should make it impossiblefor the mutts to follow us but I dont know The wolf andmonkey mutts Ive encountered could leap unbelievably farThe hissing burns my ears and the reek of rosesmakes the walls spinI grab Polluxs arm Forget the mission Whats thequickest way abovegroundTheres no time for checking the Holo We follow Polluxfor about ten yards along the Transfer and go through adoorway Im aware of tile changing to concrete of crawlingthrough a tight stinking pipe onto a ledge about a footwide Were in the main sewer A yard below a poisonousbrew of human waste garbage and chemical runoffbubbles by us Parts of the surface are on fire others emitevillooking clouds of vapor One look tells you that if you fallin youre never coming out Moving as quickly as we dareon the slippery ledge we make our way to a narrow bridgeand cross it In an alcove at the far side Pollux smacks aladder with his hand and points up the shaft This is it Ourway outA quick glance at our party tells me somethings offWait Where are Jackson and Leeg OneThey stayed at the Grinder to hold the mutts backsays HomesWhat Im lunging back for the bridge willing to leaveno one to those monsters when he yanks me backDont waste their lives Katniss Its too late for themLook Homes nods to the pipe where the mutts areslithering onto the ledgeStand back Gale shouts With his explosivetippedarrows he rips the far side of the bridge from itsfoundation The rest sinks into the bubbles just as the muttsreach itFor the first time I get a good look at them A mix ofhuman and lizard and who knows what else White tightreptilian skin smeared with gore clawed hands and feettheir faces a mess of conflicting features Hissing shriekingmy name now as their bodies contort in rage Lashing outwith tails and claws taking huge chunks of one another ortheir own bodies with wide lathered mouths driven mad bytheir need to destroy me My scent must be as evocative tothem as theirs is to me More so because despite itstoxicity the mutts begin to throw themselves into the foulsewerAlong our bank everyone opens fire I choose myarrows without discretion sending arrowheads fireexplosives into the mutts bodies Theyre mortal but onlyjust No natural thing could keep coming with two dozenbullets in it Yes we can eventually kill them only there areso many an endless supply pouring from the pipe not evenhesitating to take to the sewageBut its not their numbers that make my hands shakesoNo mutt is good All are meant to damage you Sometake your life like the monkeys Others your reason like thetracker jackers However the true atrocities the mostfrightening incorporate a perverse psychological twistdesigned to terrify the victim The sight of the wolf muttswith the dead tributes eyes The sound of the jabberjaysreplicating Prims tortured screams The smell of Snowsroses mixed with the victims blood Carried across thesewer Cutting through even this foulness Making my heartrun wild my skin turn to ice my lungs unable to suck air Itsas if Snows breathing right in my face telling me its time todieThe others are shouting at me but I cant seem torespond Strong arms lift me as I blast the head off a muttwhose claws have just grazed my ankle Im slammed intothe ladder Hands shoved against the rungs Ordered toclimb My wooden puppet limbs obey Movement slowlybrings me back to my senses I detect one person aboveme Pollux Peeta and Cressida are below We reach aplatform Switch to a second ladder Rungs slick with sweatand mildew At the next platform my head has cleared andthe reality of whats happened hits me I begin franticallypulling people up off the ladder Peeta Cressida Thats itWhat have I done What have I abandoned the othersto Im scrambling back down the ladder when one of myboots kicks someoneClimb Gale barks at me Im back up hauling him inpeering into the gloom for more No Gale turns my faceto him and shakes his head Uniform shredded Gapingwound in the side of his neckTheres a human cry from below Someones stillalive I pleadNo Katniss Theyre not coming says Gale Only themutts areUnable to accept it I shine the light from Cressidasgun down the shaft Far below I can just make out Finnickstruggling to hang on as three mutts tear at him As oneyanks back his head to take the death bite somethingbizarre happens Its as if Im Finnick watching images ofmy life flash by The mast of a boat a silver parachuteMags laughing a pink sky Beetees trident Annie in herwedding dress waves breaking over rocks Then its overI slide the Holo from my belt and choke out nightlocknightlock nightlock Release it Hunch against the wall withthe others as the explosion rocks the platform and bits ofmutt and human flesh shoot out of the pipe and shower usTheres a clank as Pollux slams a cover over the pipeand locks it in place Pollux Gale Cressida Peeta andme Were all thats left Later the human feelings will comeNow Im conscious only of an animal need to keep theremnants of our band alive We cant stop hereSomeone comes up with a bandage We tie it aroundGales neck Get him to his feet Only one figure stayshuddled against the wall Peeta I say Theres noresponse Has he blacked out I crouch in front of himpulling his cuffed hands from his face Peeta His eyesare like black pools the pupils dilated so that the blueirises have all but vanished The muscles in his wrists arehard as metalLeave me he whispers I cant hang onYes You can I tell himPeeta shakes his head Im losing it Ill go mad LikethemLike the mutts Like a rabid beast bent on ripping mythroat out And here finally here in this place in thesecircumstances I will really have to kill him And Snow willwin Hot bitter hatred courses through me Snow has wontoo much already todayIts a long shot its suicide maybe but I do the onlything I can think of I lean in and kiss Peeta full on the mouthHis whole body starts shuddering but I keep my lipspressed to his until I have to come up for air My handsslide up his wrists to clasp his Dont let him take you frommePeetas panting hard as he fights the nightmaresraging in his head No I dont want toI clench his hands to the point of pain Stay with meHis pupils contract to pinpoints dilate again rapidlyand then return to something resembling normalcyAlways he murmursI help Peeta up and address Pollux How far to thestreet He indicates its just above us I climb the lastladder and push open the lid to someones utility room Imrising to my feet when a woman throws open the door Shewears a bright turquoise silk robe embroidered with exoticbirds Her magenta hairs fluffed up like a cloud anddecorated with gilded butterflies Grease from the halfeatensausage shes holding smears her lipstick Theexpression on her face says she recognizes me Sheopens her mouth to call for helpWithout hesitation I shoot her through the heartWho the woman was calling to remains a mysterybecause after searching the apartment we find she wasalone Perhaps her cry was meant for a nearby neighbor orwas simply an expression of fear At any rate theres noone else to hear herThis apartment would be a classy place to hole up infor a while but thats a luxury we cant afford How long doyou think we have before they figure out some of uscouldve survived I askI think they could be here anytime Gale answersThey knew we were heading for the streets Probably theexplosion will throw them for a few minutes then theyll startlooking for our exit pointI go to a window that overlooks the street and when Ipeek through the blinds Im not faced with Peacekeepersbut with a bundled crowd of people going about theirbusiness During our underground journey we have left theevacuated zones far behind and surfaced in a busy sectionof the Capitol This crowd offers our only chance of escapeI dont have a Holo but I have Cressida She joins me at thewindow confirms she knows our location and gives me thegood news that we arent many blocks from the presidentsmansionOne glance at my companions tells me this is no timefor a stealth attack on Snow Gales still losing blood fromthe neck wound which we havent even cleaned Peetassitting on a velvet sofa with his teeth clamped down on apillow either fighting off madness or containing a screamPollux weeps against the mantel of an ornate fireplaceCressida stands determinedly at my side but shes so paleher lips are bloodless Im running on hate When the energyfor that ebbs Ill be worthlessLets check her closets I sayIn one bedroom we find hundreds of the womansoutfits coats pairs of shoes a rainbow of wigs enoughmakeup to paint a house In a bedroom across the halltheres a similar selection for men Perhaps they belong toher husband Perhaps to a lover who had the good luck tobe out this morningI call the others to dress At the sight of Peetas bloodywrists I dig in my pocket for the handcuff key but he jerksaway from meNo he says Dont They help hold me togetherYou might need your hands says GaleWhen I feel myself slipping I dig my wrists into themand the pain helps me focus says Peeta I let them beFortunately its cold out so we can conceal most ofour uniforms and weapons under flowing coats and cloaksWe hang our boots around our necks by their laces andhide them pull on silly shoes to replace them The realchallenge of course is our faces Cressida and Pollux runthe risk of being recognized by acquaintances Gale couldbe familiar from the propos and news and Peeta and I areknown by every citizen of Panem We hastily help oneanother apply thick layers of makeup pull on wigs andsunglasses Cressida wraps scarves over Peetas and mymouths and nosesI can feel the clock ticking away but stop for just a fewmoments to stuff pockets with food and firstaid suppliesStay together I say at the front door Then we march rightinto the street Snow flurries have begun to fall Agitatedpeople swirl around us speaking of rebels and hunger andme in their affected Capitol accents We cross the streetpass a few more apartments Just as we turn the cornerthree dozen Peacekeepers sweep past us We hop out oftheir way as the real citizens do wait until the crowd returnsto its normal flow and keep moving Cressida I whisperCan you think of anywhereIm trying she saysWe cover another block and the sirens begin Throughan apartment window I see an emergency report andpictures of our faces flashing They havent identified who inour party died yet because I see Castor and Finnickamong the photos Soon every passerby will be asdangerous as a Peacekeeper CressidaTheres one place Its not ideal But we can try it shesays We follow her a few more blocks and turn through agate into what looks like a private residence Its some kindof shortcut though because after walking through amanicured garden we come out of another gate onto asmall back street that connects two main avenues Thereare a few poky storesone that buys used goods anotherthat sells fake jewelry Only a couple of people are aroundand they pay no attention to us Cressida begins to babblein a highpitched voice about fur undergarments howessential they are during the cold months Wait until yousee the prices Believe me its half what you pay on theavenuesWe stop before a grimy storefront filled withmannequins in furry underwear The place doesnt evenlook open but Cressida pushes through the front doorsetting off a dissonant chiming Inside the dim narrow shoplined with racks of merchandise the smell of pelts fills mynose Business must be slow since were the onlycustomers Cressida heads straight for a hunched figuresitting in the back I follow trailing my fingers through thesoft garments as we goBehind a counter sits the strangest person Ive everseen Shes an extreme example of surgical enhancementgone wrong for surely not even in the Capitol could theyfind this face attractive The skin has been pulled backtightly and tattooed with black and gold stripes The nosehas been flattened until it barely exists Ive seen catwhiskers on people in the Capitol before but none so longThe result is a grotesque semifeline mask which nowsquints at us distrustfullyCressida takes off her wig revealing her vinesTigris she says We need helpTigris Deep in my brain the name rings a bell Shewas a fixturea younger less disturbing version of herselfin the earliest Hunger Games I can remember A stylist Ithink I dont remember for which district Not  Then shemust have had one operation too many and crossed theline into repellenceSo this is where stylists go when theyve outlived theiruse To sad theme underwear shops where they wait fordeath Out of the public eyeI stare at her face wondering if her parents actuallynamed her Tigris inspiring her mutilation or if she chosethe style and changed her name to match her stripesPlutarch said you could be trusted adds CressidaGreat shes one of Plutarchs people So if her firstmove isnt to turn us in to the Capitol it will be to notifyPlutarch and by extension Coin of our whereabouts NoTigriss shop is not ideal but its all we have at the momentIf shell even help us Shes peering between an oldtelevision on her counter and us as if trying to place us Tohelp her I pull down my scarf remove my wig and stepcloser so that the light of the screen falls on my faceTigris gives a low growl not unlike one Buttercup mightgreet me with She slinks down off her stool anddisappears behind a rack of furlined leggings Theres asound of sliding and then her hand emerges and waves usforward Cressida looks at me as if to ask Are you sureBut what choice do we have Returning to the streets underthese conditions guarantees our capture or death I pusharound the furs and find Tigris has slid back a panel at thebase of the wall Behind it seems to be the top of a steepstone stairway She gestures for me to enterEverything about the situation screams trap I have amoment of panic and find myself turning to Tigris searchingthose tawny eyes Why is she doing this Shes no Cinnasomeone willing to sacrifice herself for others This womanwas the embodiment of Capitol shallowness She was oneof the stars of the Hunger Games untiluntil she wasnt Sois that it then Bitterness Hatred Revenge Actually Imcomforted by the idea A need for revenge can burn longand hot Especially if every glance in a mirror reinforces itDid Snow ban you from the Games I ask She juststares back at me Somewhere her tiger tail flicks withdispleasure Because Im going to kill him you know Hermouth spreads into what I take for a smile Reassured thatthis isnt complete madness I crawl through the spaceAbout halfway down the steps my face runs into ahanging chain and I pull it illuminating the hideout with aflickering fluorescent bulb Its a small cellar with no doors orwindows Shallow and wide Probably just a strip betweentwo real basements A place whose existence could gounnoticed unless you had a very keen eye for dimensionsIts cold and dank with piles of pelts that Im guessinghavent seen the light of day in years Unless Tigris gives usup I dont believe anyone will find us here By the time Ireach the concrete floor my companions are on the stepsThe panel slides back in place I hear the underwear rackbeing adjusted on squeaky wheels Tigris padding back toher stool We have been swallowed up by her storeJust in time too because Gale looks on the verge ofcollapse We make a bed of pelts strip off his layers ofweapons and help him onto his back At the end of thecellar theres a faucet about a foot from the floor with adrain under it I turn the tap and after much sputtering and alot of rust clear water begins to flow We clean Gales neckwound and I realize bandages wont be enough Hes goingto need a few stitches Theres a needle and sterile threadin the firstaid supplies but what we lack is a healer Itcrosses my mind to enlist Tigris As a stylist she mustknow how to work a needle But that would leave no onemanning the shop and shes doing enough already Iaccept that Im probably the most qualified for the job gritmy teeth and put in a row of jagged sutures Its not prettybut its functional I smear it with medicine and wrap it upGive him some painkillers You can rest now Its safehere I tell him He goes out like a lightWhile Cressida and Pollux make fur nests for each ofus I attend to Peetas wrists Gently rinsing away the bloodputting on an antiseptic and bandaging them beneath thecuffs Youve got to keep them clean otherwise theinfection could spread andI know what blood poisoning is Katniss says PeetaEven if my mother isnt a healerIm jolted back in time to another wound another set ofbandages You said that same thing to me in the firstHunger Games Real or not realReal he says And you risked your life getting themedicine that saved meReal I shrug You were the reason I was alive to doitWas I The comment throws him into confusionSome shiny memory must be fighting for his attentionbecause his body tenses and his newly bandaged wristsstrain against the metal cuffs Then all the energy saps fromhis body Im so tired KatnissGo to sleep I say He wont until Ive rearranged hishandcuffs and shackled him to one of the stair supports Itcant be comfortable lying there with his arms above hishead But in a few minutes he drifts off tooCressida and Pollux have made beds for us arrangedour food and medical supplies and now ask what I want todo about setting up a guard I look at Gales pallor Peetasrestraints Pollux hasnt slept for days and Cressida and Ionly napped for a few hours If a troop of Peacekeeperswere to come through that door wed be trapped like ratsWe are completely at the mercy of a decrepit tigerwomanwith what I can only hope is an allconsuming passion forSnows deathI dont honestly think theres any point in setting up aguard Lets just try to get some sleep I say They nodnumbly and we all burrow into our pelts The fire inside mehas flickered out and with it my strength I surrender to thesoft musty fur and oblivionI have only one dream I remember A long andwearying thing in which Im trying to get to District  Thehome Im seeking is intact the people alive Effie Trinketconspicuous in a bright pink wig and tailored outfit travelswith me I keep trying to ditch her in places but sheinexplicably reappears at my side insisting that as myescort shes responsible for my staying on schedule Onlythe schedule is constantly shifting derailed by our lack of astamp from an official or delayed when Effie breaks one ofher high heels We camp for days on a bench in a graystation in District  awaiting a train that never comesWhen I wake somehow I feel even more drained by thisthan my usual nighttime forays into blood and terrorCressida the only person awake tells me its lateafternoon I eat a can of beef stew and wash it down with alot of water Then I lean against the cellar wall retracing theevents of the last day Moving death by death Countingthem up on my fingers One twoMitchell and Boggs loston the block ThreeMessalla melted by the pod Four fiveLeeg  and Jackson sacrificing themselves at the MeatGrinder Six seven eightCastor Homes and Finnickbeing decapitated by the rosescented lizard mutts Eightdead in twentyfour hours I know it happened and yet itdoesnt seem real Surely Castor is asleep under that pileof furs Finnick will come bounding down the steps in aminute Boggs will tell me his plan for our escapeTo believe them dead is to accept I killed them Okaymaybe not Mitchell and Boggsthey died on an actualassignment But the others lost their lives defending me ona mission I fabricated My plot to assassinate Snow seemsso stupid now So stupid as I sit shivering here in this cellartallying up our losses fingering the tassels on the silverkneehigh boots I stole from the womans home Oh yeahIforgot about that I killed her too Im taking out unarmedcitizens nowI think its time I give myself upWhen everyone finally awakens I confess How I liedabout the mission how I jeopardized everyone in pursuit ofrevenge Theres a long silence after I finish Then Galesays Katniss we all knew you were lying about Coinsending you to assassinate SnowYou knew maybe The soldiers from Thirteen didnt IreplyDo you really think Jackson believed you had ordersfrom Coin Cressida asks Of course she didnt But shetrusted Boggs and hed clearly wanted you to go onI never even told Boggs what I planned to do I sayYou told everyone in Command Gale says It wasone of your conditions for being the Mockingjay I killSnowThose seem like two disconnected things Negotiatingwith Coin for the privilege of executing Snow after the warand this unauthorized flight through the Capitol But not likethis I say Its been a complete disasterI think it would be considered a highly successfulmission says Gale Weve infiltrated the enemy campshowing that the Capitols defenses can be breachedWeve managed to get footage of ourselves all over theCapitols news Weve thrown the whole city into chaostrying to find usTrust me Plutarchs thrilled Cressida addsThats because Plutarch doesnt care who dies I sayNot as long as his Games are a successCressida and Gale go round and round trying toconvince me Pollux nods at their words to back them upOnly Peeta doesnt offer an opinionWhat do you think Peeta I finally ask himI thinkyou still have no idea The effect you canhave He slides his cuffs up the support and pusheshimself to a sitting position None of the people we lostwere idiots They knew what they were doing They followedyou because they believed you really could kill SnowI dont know why his voice reaches me when no oneelses can But if hes right and I think he is I owe the othersa debt that can only be repaid in one way I pull my papermap from a pocket in my uniform and spread it out on thefloor with new resolve Where are we CressidaTigriss shop sits about five blocks from the City Circleand Snows mansion Were in easy walking distancethrough a zone in which the pods are deactivated for theresidents safety We have disguises that perhaps withsome embellishments from Tigriss furry stock could get ussafely there But then what The mansions sure to beheavily guarded under roundtheclock camerasurveillance and laced with pods that could become live atthe flick of a switchWhat we need is to get him out in the open Galesays to me Then one of us could pick him offDoes he ever appear in public anymore asksPeetaI dont think so says Cressida At least in all therecent speeches Ive seen hes been in the mansion Evenbefore the rebels got here I imagine he became morevigilant after Finnick aired his crimesThats right Its not just the Tigrises of the Capitol whohate Snow now but a web of people who know what he didto their friends and families It would have to be somethingbordering on miraculous to lure him out Something likeI bet hed come out for me I say If I were capturedHed want that as public as possible Hed want myexecution on his front steps I let this sink in Then Galecould shoot him from the audienceNo Peeta shakes his head There are too manyalternative endings to that plan Snow might decide to keepyou and torture information out of you Or have youexecuted publicly without being present Or kill you insidethe mansion and display your body out frontGale I sayIt seems like an extreme solution to jump toimmediately he says Maybe if all else fails Lets keepthinkingIn the quiet that follows we hear Tigriss soft footfalloverhead It must be closing time Shes locking upfastening the shutters maybe A few minutes later the panelat the top of the stairs slides openCome up says a gravelly voice I have some foodfor you Its the first time shes talked since we arrivedWhether its natural or from years of practice I dont knowbut theres something in her manner of speaking thatsuggests a cats purrAs we climb the stairs Cressida asks Did youcontact Plutarch TigrisNo way to Tigris shrugs Hell figure out youre in asafe house Dont worryWorry I feel immensely relieved by the news that Iwont be givenand have to ignoredirect orders from Or make up some viable defense for the decisions Ivemade over the last couple of daysIn the shop the counter holds some stale hunks ofbread a wedge of moldy cheese and half a bottle ofmustard It reminds me that not everyone in the Capitol hasfull stomachs these days I feel obliged to tell Tigris aboutour remaining food supplies but she waves my objectionsaway I eat next to nothing she says And then only rawmeat This seems a little too in character but I dontquestion it I just scrape the mold off the cheese and divideup the food among the rest of usWhile we eat we watch the latest Capitol newscoverage The government has the rebel survivorsnarrowed down to the five of us Huge bounties are offeredfor information leading to our capture They emphasize howdangerous we are Show us exchanging gunfire with thePeacekeepers although not the mutts ripping off theirheads Do a tragic tribute to the woman lying where we lefther with my arrow still in her heart Someone has redoneher makeup for the camerasThe rebels let the Capitol broadcast run onuninterrupted Have the rebels made a statement today Iask Tigris She shakes her head I doubt Coin knows whatto do with me now that Im still aliveTigris gives a throaty cackle No one knows what todo with you girlie Then she makes me take a pair of thefur leggings even though I cant pay her for them Its thekind of gift you have to accept And anyway its cold in thatcellarDownstairs after supper we continue to rack ourbrains for a plan Nothing good comes up but we do agreethat we can no longer go out as a group of five and that weshould try to infiltrate the presidents mansion before I turnmyself into bait I consent to that second point to avoidfurther argument If I do decide to give myself up it wontrequire anyone elses permission or participationWe change bandages handcuff Peeta back to hissupport and settle down to sleep A few hours later I slipback into consciousness and become aware of a quietconversation Peeta and Gale I cant stop myself fromeavesdroppingThanks for the water Peeta saysNo problem Gale replies I wake up ten times anight anywayTo make sure Katniss is still here asks PeetaSomething like that Gale admitsTheres a long pause before Peeta speaks againThat was funny what Tigris said About no one knowingwhat to do with herWell we never have Gale saysThey both laugh Its so strange to hear them talkinglike this Almost like friends Which theyre not Never havebeen Although theyre not exactly enemiesShe loves you you know says Peeta She as goodas told me after they whipped youDont believe it Gale answers The way she kissedyou in the Quarter Quellwell she never kissed me likethatIt was just part of the show Peeta tells him althoughtheres an edge of doubt in his voiceNo you won her over Gave up everything for herMaybe thats the only way to convince her you love herTheres a long pause I should have volunteered to takeyour place in the first Games Protected her thenYou couldnt says Peeta Shed never have forgivenyou You had to take care of her family They matter more toher than her lifeWell it wont be an issue much longer I think itsunlikely all three of us will be alive at the end of the war Andif we are I guess its Katnisss problem Who to chooseGale yawns We should get some sleepYeah I hear Peetas handcuffs slide down thesupport as he settles in I wonder how shell make up hermindOh that I do know I can just catch Gales last wordsthrough the layer of fur Katniss will pick whoever shethinks she cant survive withoutA chill runs through me Am I really that cold andcalculating Gale didnt say Katniss will pick whoever itwill break her heart to give up or even whoever she cantlive without Those would have implied I was motivated bya kind of passion But my best friend predicts I will choosethe person who I think I cant survive without Theres notthe least indication that love or desire or evencompatibility will sway me Ill just conduct an unfeelingassessment of what my potential mates can offer me As ifin the end it will be the question of whether a baker or ahunter will extend my longevity the most Its a horrible thingfor Gale to say for Peeta not to refute Especially whenevery emotion I have has been taken and exploited by theCapitol or the rebels At the moment the choice would besimple I can survive just fine without either of themIn the morning I have no time or energy to nursewounded feelings During a predawn breakfast of liver pateand fig cookies we gather around Tigriss television forone of Beetees breakins Theres been a newdevelopment in the war Apparently inspired by the blackwave some enterprising rebel commander came up withthe idea of confiscating peoples abandoned automobilesand sending them unmanned down the streets The carsdont trigger every pod but they certainly get the majority Ataround four in the morning the rebels began carving threeseparate pathssimply referred to as the A B and C linesto the Capitols heart As a result theyve secured blockafter block with very few casualtiesThis cant last says Gale In fact Im surprisedtheyve kept it going so long The Capitol will adjust bydeactivating specific pods and then manually triggeringthem when their targets come in range Almost withinminutes of his prediction we see this very thing happen onscreenA squad sends a car down a block setting off fourpods All seems well Three scouts follow and make itsafely to the end of the street But when a group of twentyrebel soldiers follow them theyre blown to bits by a row ofpotted rosebushes in front of a flower shopI bet its killing Plutarch not to be in the control roomon this one says PeetaBeetee gives the broadcast back to the Capitol wherea grimfaced reporter announces the blocks that civiliansare to evacuate Between her update and the previousstory I am able to mark my paper map to show the relativepositions of the opposing armiesI hear scuffling out on the street move to the windowsand peek out a crack in the shutters In the early morninglight I see a bizarre spectacle Refugees from the nowoccupied blocks are streaming toward the Capitols centerThe most panicked are wearing nothing but nightgownsand slippers while the more prepared are heavily bundledin layers of clothes They carry everything from lapdogs tojewelry boxes to potted plants One man in a fluffy robeholds only an overripe banana Confused sleepy childrenstumble along after their parents most either too stunned ortoo baffled to cry Bits of them flash by my line of vision Apair of wide brown eyes An arm clutching a favorite doll Apair of bare feet bluish in the cold catching on the unevenpaving stones of the alley Seeing them reminds me of thechildren of  who died fleeing the firebombs I leave thewindowTigris offers to be our spy for the day since shes theonly one of us without a bounty on her head After securingus downstairs she goes out into the Capitol to pick up anyhelpful informationDown in the cellar I pace back and forth driving theothers crazy Something tells me that not taking advantageof the flood of refugees is a mistake What better covercould we have On the other hand every displaced personmilling about on the streets means another pair of eyeslooking for the five rebels on the loose Then again what dowe gain by staying here All were really doing is depletingour small cache of food and waiting forwhat The rebelsto take the Capitol It could be weeks before that happensand Im not so sure what Id do if they did Not run out andgreet them Coin would have me whisked back to before I could say nightlock nightlock nightlock I did notcome all this way and lose all those people to turn myselfover to that woman I kill Snow Besides there would be anawful lot of things I couldnt easily explain about the last fewdays Several of which if they came to light would probablyblow my deal for the victors immunity right out of the waterAnd forget about me Ive got a feeling some of the othersare going to need it Like Peeta Who no matter how youspin it can be seen on tape tossing Mitchell into that netpod I can imagine what Coins war tribunal will do with thatBy late afternoon were beginning to get uneasy aboutTigriss long absence Talk turns to the possibilities that shehas been apprehended and arrested turned us involuntarily or simply been injured in the wave of refugeesBut around six oclock we hear her return Theres someshuffling around upstairs then she opens the panel Thewonderful smell of frying meat fills the air Tigris hasprepared us a hash of chopped ham and potatoes Its thefirst hot food weve had in days and as I wait for her to fillmy plate Im in danger of actually droolingAs I chew I try to pay attention to Tigris telling us howshe acquired it but the main thing I absorb is that furunderwear is a valuable trading item at the momentEspecially for people who left their homes underdressedMany are still out on the street trying to find shelter for thenight Those who live in the choice apartments of the innercity have not flung open their doors to house the displacedOn the contrary most of them bolted their locks drew theirshutters and pretended to be out Now the City Circlespacked with refugees and the Peacekeepers are goingdoor to door breaking into places if they have to to assignhouseguestsOn the television we watch a terse HeadPeacekeeper lay out specific rules regarding how manypeople per square foot each resident will be expected totake in He reminds the citizens of the Capitol thattemperatures will drop well below freezing tonight andwarns them that their president expects them to be not onlywilling but enthusiastic hosts in this time of crisis Then theyshow some very stagedlooking shots of concernedcitizens welcoming grateful refugees into their homes TheHead Peacekeeper says the president himself has orderedpart of his mansion readied to receive citizens tomorrowHe adds that shopkeepers should also be prepared to lendtheir floor space if requestedTigris that could be you says Peeta I realize hesright That even this narrow hallway of a shop could beappropriated as the numbers swell Then well be trulytrapped in the cellar in constant danger of discovery Howmany days do we have One Maybe twoThe Head Peacekeeper comes back with moreinstructions for the population It seems that this eveningthere was an unfortunate incident where a crowd beat todeath a young man who resembled Peeta Henceforth allrebel sightings are to be reported immediately toauthorities who will deal with the identification and arrest ofthe suspect They show a photo of the victim Apart fromsome obviously bleached curls he looks about as muchlike Peeta as I doPeople have gone wild Cressida murmursWe watch a brief rebel update in which we learn thatseveral more blocks have been taken today I make note ofthe intersections on my map and study it Line C is onlyfour blocks from here I announce Somehow that fills mewith more anxiety than the idea of Peacekeepers lookingfor housing I become very helpful Let me wash thedishesIll give you a hand Gale collects the platesI feel Peetas eyes follow us out of the room In thecramped kitchen at the back of Tigriss shop I fill the sinkwith hot water and suds Do you think its true I ask ThatSnow will let refugees into the mansionI think he has to now at least for the cameras saysGaleIm leaving in the morning I sayIm going with you Gale says What should we dowith the othersPollux and Cressida could be useful Theyre goodguides I say Pollux and Cressida arent actually theproblem But Peetas tooUnpredictable finishes Gale Do you think hed stilllet us leave him behindWe can make the argument that hell endanger us Isay He might stay here if were convincingPeetas fairly rational about our suggestion He readilyagrees that his company could put the other four of us atrisk Im thinking this may all work out that he can just sit outthe war in Tigriss cellar when he announces hes going outon his ownTo do what asks CressidaIm not sure exactly The one thing that I might still beuseful at is causing a diversion You saw what happened tothat man who looked like me he saysWhat if youlose control I sayYou meango mutt Well if I feel that coming on Illtry to get back here he assures meAnd if Snow gets you again asks Gale You donteven have a gunIll just have to take my chances says Peeta Likethe rest of you The two exchange a long look and thenGale reaches into his breast pocket He places hisnightlock tablet in Peetas hand Peeta lets it lie on his openpalm neither rejecting nor accepting it What about youDont worry Beetee showed me how to detonate myexplosive arrows by hand If that fails Ive got my knife AndIll have Katniss says Gale with a smile She wont givethem the satisfaction of taking me aliveThe thought of Peacekeepers dragging Gale awaystarts the tune playing in my head againAre you are youComing to the treeTake it Peeta I say in a strained voice I reach outand close his fingers over the pill No one will be there tohelp youWe spend a fitful night woken by one anothersnightmares minds buzzing with the next days plans Imrelieved when five oclock rolls around and we can beginwhatever this day holds for us We eat a mishmash of ourremaining foodcanned peaches crackers and snailsleaving one can of salmon for Tigris as meager thanks forall shes done The gesture seems to touch her in someway Her face contorts in an odd expression and she fliesinto action She spends the next hour remaking the five ofus She redresses us so regular clothes hide our uniformsbefore we even don our coats and cloaks Covers ourmilitary boots with some sort of furry slippers Secures ourwigs with pins Cleans off the garish remains of the paintwe so hastily applied to our faces and makes us up againDrapes our outerwear to conceal our weapons Then givesus handbags and bundles of knickknacks to carry In theend we look exactly like the refugees fleeing the rebelsNever underestimate the power of a brilliant stylistsays Peeta Its hard to tell but I think Tigris might actuallyblush under her stripesThere are no helpful updates on the television but thealley seems as thick with refugees as the previous morningOur plan is to slip into the crowd in three groups FirstCressida and Pollux who will act as guides while keepinga safe lead on us Then Gale and myself who intend toposition ourselves among the refugees assigned to themansion today Then Peeta who will trail behind us readyto create a disturbance as neededTigris watches through the shutters for the rightmoment unbolts the door and nods to Cressida andPollux Take care Cressida says and they are goneWell be following in a minute I get out the key unlockPeetas cuffs and stuff them in my pocket He rubs hiswrists Flexes them I feel a kind of desperation rising up inme Its like Im back in the Quarter Quell with Beetee givingJohanna and me that coil of wireListen I say Dont do anything foolishNo Its lastresort stuff Completely he saysI wrap my arms around his neck feel his arms hesitatebefore they embrace me Not as steady as they once werebut still warm and strong A thousand moments surgethrough me All the times these arms were my only refugefrom the world Perhaps not fully appreciated then but sosweet in my memory and now gone forever All rightthen I release himIts time says Tigris I kiss her cheek fasten my redhooded cloak pull my scarf up over my nose and followGale out into the frigid airSharp icy snowflakes bite my exposed skin The risingsuns trying to break through the gloom without muchsuccess Theres enough light to see the bundled formsclosest to you and little more Perfect conditions reallyexcept that I cant locate Cressida and Pollux Gale and Idrop our heads and shuffle along with the refugees I canhear what I missed peeking through the shutters yesterdayCrying moaning labored breathing And not too far awaygunfireWhere are we going Uncle a shivering little boyasks a man weighed down with a small safeTo the presidents mansion Theyll assign us a newplace to live puffs the manWe turn off the alley and spill out onto one of the mainavenues Stay to the right a voice orders and I see thePeacekeepers interspersed throughout the crowddirecting the flow of human traffic Scared faces peer out ofthe plateglass windows of the shops which are alreadybecoming overrun with refugees At this rate Tigris mayhave new houseguests by lunch It was good for everybodythat we got out when we didIts brighter now even with the snow picking up I catchsight of Cressida and Pollux about thirty yards ahead of usplodding along with the crowd I crane my head around tosee if I can locate Peeta I cant but Ive caught the eye ofan inquisitivelooking little girl in a lemon yellow coat Inudge Gale and slow my pace ever so slightly to allow awall of people to form between usWe might need to split up I say under my breathTheres a girlGunfire rips through the crowd and several peoplenear me slump to the ground Screams pierce the air as asecond round mows down another group behind us Galeand I drop to the street scuttle the ten yards to the shopsand take cover behind a display of spikeheeled bootsoutside a shoe sellersA row of feathery footwear blocks Gales view Who isit Can you see he asks me What I can see betweenalternating pairs of lavender and mint green leather bootsis a street full of bodies The little girl who was watching mekneels beside a motionless woman screeching and tryingto rouse her Another wave of bullets slices across thechest of her yellow coat staining it with red knocking thegirl onto her back For a moment looking at her tinycrumpled form I lose my ability to form words Gale prodsme with his elbow KatnissTheyre shooting from the roof above us I tell Gale Iwatch a few more rounds see the white uniforms droppinginto the snowy streets Trying to take out thePeacekeepers but theyre not exactly crack shots It mustbe the rebels I dont feel a rush of joy althoughtheoretically my allies have broken through I am transfixedby that lemon yellow coatIf we start shooting thats it Gale says The wholeworld will know its usIts true Were armed only with our fabulous bows Torelease an arrow would be like announcing to both sidesthat were hereNo I say forcefully Weve got to get to SnowThen we better start moving before the whole blockgoes up says Gale Hugging the wall we continue alongthe street Only the wall is mostly shopwindows A pattern ofsweaty palms and gaping faces presses against the glassI yank my scarf up higher over my cheekbones as we dartbetween outdoor displays Behind a rack of framed photosof Snow we encounter a wounded Peacekeeper proppedagainst a strip of brick wall He asks us for help Galeknees him in the side of the head and takes his gun At theintersection he shoots a second Peacekeeper and weboth have firearmsSo who are we supposed to be now I askDesperate citizens of the Capitol says Gale ThePeacekeepers will think were on their side and hopefullythe rebels have more interesting targetsIm mulling over the wisdom of this latest role as wesprint across the intersection but by the time we reach thenext block it no longer matters who we are Who anyone isBecause no one is looking at faces The rebels are here allright Pouring onto the avenue taking cover in doorwaysbehind vehicles guns blazing hoarse voices shoutingcommands as they prepare to meet an army ofPeacekeepers marching toward us Caught in the crossfire are the refugees unarmed disoriented manywoundedA pods activated ahead of us releasing a gush ofsteam that parboils everyone in its path leaving the victimsintestinepink and very dead After that what little sense oforder there was unravels As the remaining curlicues ofsteam intertwine with the snow visibility extends just to theend of my barrel Peacekeeper rebel citizen who knowsEverything that moves is a target People shoot reflexivelyand Im no exception Heart pounding adrenaline burningthrough me everyone is my enemy Except Gale Myhunting partner the one person who has my back Theresnothing to do but move forward killing whoever comes intoour path Screaming people bleeding people dead peopleeverywhere As we reach the next corner the entire blockahead of us lights up with a rich purple glow Webackpedal hunker down in a stairwell and squint into thelight Somethings happening to those illuminated by itTheyre assaulted bywhat A sound A wave A laserWeapons fall from their hands fingers clutch their faces asblood sprays from all visible orificeseyes noses mouthsears In less than a minute everyones dead and the glowvanishes I grit my teeth and run leaping over the bodiesfeet slipping in the gore The wind whips the snow intoblinding swirls but doesnt block out the sound of anotherwave of boots headed our wayGet down I hiss at Gale We drop where we are Myface lands in a stillwarm pool of someones blood but Iplay dead remain motionless as the boots march over usSome avoid the bodies Others grind into my hand myback kick my head in passing As the boots recede I openmy eyes and nod to GaleOn the next block we encounter more terrifiedrefugees but few soldiers Just when it seems we mighthave caught a break theres a cracking sound like an egghitting the side of a bowl but magnified a thousand timesWe stop look around for the pod Theres nothing Then Ifeel the tips of my boots beginning to tilt ever so slightlyRun I cry to Gale Theres no time to explain but in a fewseconds the nature of the pod becomes clear to everyoneA seam has opened up down the center of the block Thetwo sides of the tiled street are folding down like flapsslowly emptying the people into whatever lies beneathIm torn between making a beeline for the nextintersection and trying to get to the doors that line the streetand break my way into a building As a result I end upmoving at a slight diagonal As the flap continues to drop Ifind my feet scrambling harder and harder to findpurchase on the slippery tiles Its like running along theside of an icy hill that gets steeper at every step Both of mydestinationsthe intersection and the buildingsare a fewfeet away when I feel the flap going Theres nothing to dobut use my last seconds of connection to the tiles to pushoff for the intersection As my hands latch on to the side Irealize the flaps have swung straight down My feet danglein the air no foothold anywhere From fifty feet below a vilestench hits my nose like rotted corpses in the summerheat Black forms crawl around in the shadows silencingwhoever survives the fallA strangled cry comes from my throat No one iscoming to help me Im losing my grip on the icy ledgewhen I see Im only about six feet from the corner of the podI inch my hands along the ledge trying to block out theterrifying sounds from below When my hands straddle thecorner I swing my right boot up over the side It catches onsomething and I painstakingly drag myself up to street levelPanting trembling I crawl out and wrap my arm around alamppost for an anchor although the grounds perfectly flatGale I call into the abyss heedless of beingrecognized GaleOver here I look in bewilderment to my left The flapheld up everything to the very base of the buildings Adozen or so people made it that far and now hang fromwhatever provides a handhold Doorknobs knockers mailslots Three doors down from me Gale clings to thedecorative iron grating around an apartment door He couldeasily get inside if it was open But despite repeated kicksto the door no one comes to his aidCover yourself I lift my gun He turns away and I drillthe lock until the door flies inward Gale swings into thedoorway landing in a heap on the floor For a moment Iexperience the elation of his rescue Then the whiteglovedhands clamp down on himGale meets my eyes mouths something at me I cantmake out I dont know what to do I cant leave him but Icant reach him either His lips move again I shake myhead to indicate my confusion At any minute theyll realizewho theyve captured The Peacekeepers are hauling himinside now Go I hear him yellI turn and run away from the pod All alone now Gale aprisoner Cressida and Pollux could be dead ten timesover And Peeta I havent laid eyes on him since we leftTigriss I hold on to the idea that he may have gone backFelt an attack coming and retreated to the cellar while hestill had control Realized there was no need for a diversionwhen the Capitol has provided so many No need to be baitand have to take the nightlockthe nightlock Gale doesnthave any And as for all that talk of detonating his arrows byhand hell never get the chance The first thing thePeacekeepers will do is to strip him of his weaponsI fall into a doorway tears stinging my eyes Shoot meThats what he was mouthing I was supposed to shoot himThat was my job That was our unspoken promise all of usto one another And I didnt do it and now the Capitol will killhim or torture him or hijack him orthe cracks beginopening inside me threatening to break me into pieces Ihave only one hope That the Capitol falls lays down itsarms and gives up its prisoners before they hurt Gale But Icant see that happening while Snows aliveA pair of Peacekeepers runs by barely glancing at thewhimpering Capitol girl huddled in a doorway I choke downmy tears wipe the existing ones off my face before theycan freeze and pull myself back together Okay Im still ananonymous refugee Or did the Peacekeepers who caughtGale get a glimpse of me as I fled I remove my cloak andturn it inside out letting the black lining show instead of thered exterior Arrange the hood so it conceals my faceGrasping my gun close to my chest I survey the blockTheres only a handful of dazedlooking stragglers I trailclose behind a pair of old men who take no notice of meNo one will expect me to be with old men When we reachthe end of the next intersection they stop and I almostbump into them Its the City Circle Across the wideexpanse ringed by grand buildings sits the presidentsmansionThe Circles full of people milling around wailing orjust sitting and letting the snow pile up around them I fitright in I begin to weave my way across to the mansiontripping over abandoned treasures and snowfrosted limbsAbout halfway there I become aware of the concretebarricade Its about four feet high and extends in a largerectangle in front of the mansion You would think it wouldbe empty but its packed with refugees Maybe this is thegroup thats been chosen to be sheltered at the mansionBut as I draw closer I notice something else Everyoneinside the barricade is a child Toddlers to teenagersScared and frostbitten Huddled in groups or rockingnumbly on the ground They arent being led into themansion Theyre penned in guarded on all sides byPeacekeepers I know immediately its not for theirprotection If the Capitol wanted to safeguard them theydbe down in a bunker somewhere This is for Snowsprotection The children form his human shieldTheres a commotion and the crowd surges to the leftIm caught up by larger bodies borne sideways carried offcourse I hear shouts of The rebels The rebels and knowthey mustve broken through The momentum slams me intoa flagpole and I cling to it Using the rope that hangs fromthe top I pull myself up out of the crush of bodies Yes I cansee the rebel army pouring into the Circle driving therefugees back onto the avenues I scan the area for thepods that will surely be detonating But that doesnt happenThis is what happensA hovercraft marked with the Capitols sealmaterializes directly over the barricaded children Scoresof silver parachutes rain down on them Even in this chaosthe children know what silver parachutes contain FoodMedicine Gifts They eagerly scoop them up frozen fingersstruggling with the strings The hovercraft vanishes fiveseconds pass and then about twenty parachutessimultaneously explodeA wail rises from the crowd The snows red andlittered with undersized body parts Many of the children dieimmediately but others lie in agony on the ground Somestagger around mutely staring at the remaining silverparachutes in their hands as if they still might havesomething precious inside I can tell the Peacekeepersdidnt know this was coming by the way they are yankingaway the barricades making a path to the children Anotherflock of white uniforms sweeps into the opening But thesearent Peacekeepers Theyre medics Rebel medics Idknow the uniforms anywhere They swarm in among thechildren wielding medical kitsFirst I get a glimpse of the blond braid down her backThen as she yanks off her coat to cover a wailing child Inotice the duck tail formed by her untucked shirt I have thesame reaction I did the day Effie Trinket called her name atthe reaping At least I must go limp because I find myselfat the base of the flagpole unable to account for the lastfew seconds Then I am pushing through the crowd just as Idid before Trying to shout her name above the roar Imalmost there almost to the barricade when I think shehears me Because for just a moment she catches sight ofme her lips form my nameAnd thats when the rest of the parachutes go offReal or not real I am on fire The balls of flame thaterupted from the parachutes shot over the barricadesthrough the snowy air and landed in the crowd I was justturning away when one caught me ran its tongue up theback of my body and transformed me into something newA creature as unquenchable as the sunA fire mutt knows only a single sensation agony Nosight no sound no feeling except the unrelenting burning offlesh Perhaps there are periods of unconsciousness butwhat can it matter if I cant find refuge in them I am Cinnasbird ignited flying frantically to escape somethinginescapable The feathers of flame that grow from my bodyBeating my wings only fans the blaze I consume myself butto no endFinally my wings begin to falter I lose height andgravity pulls me into a foamy sea the color of Finnickseyes I float on my back which continues to burn beneaththe water but the agony quiets to pain When I am adriftand unable to navigate thats when they come The deadThe ones I loved fly as birds in the open sky above meSoaring weaving calling to me to join them I want so badlyto follow them but the seawater saturates my wingsmaking it impossible to lift them The ones I hated havetaken to the water horrible scaled things that tear my saltyflesh with needle teeth Biting again and again Draggingme beneath the surfaceThe small white bird tinged in pink dives down buriesher claws in my chest and tries to keep me afloat NoKatniss No You cant goBut the ones I hated are winning and if she clings tome shell be lost as well Prim let go And finally shedoesDeep in the water Im deserted by all Theres only thesound of my breathing the enormous effort it takes to drawthe water in push it out of my lungs I want to stop I try tohold my breath but the sea forces its way in and outagainst my will Let me die Let me follow the others Ibeg whatever holds me here Theres no responseTrapped for days years centuries maybe Dead butnot allowed to die Alive but as good as dead So alonethat anyone anything no matter how loathsome would bewelcome But when I finally have a visitor its sweetMorphling Coursing through my veins easing the painlightening my body so that it rises back toward the air andrests again on the foamFoam I really am floating on foam I can feel it beneaththe tips of my fingers cradling parts of my naked bodyTheres much pain but theres also something like realityThe sandpaper of my throat The smell of burn medicinefrom the first arena The sound of my mothers voice Thesethings frighten me and I try to return to the deep to makesense of them But theres no going back Gradually Imforced to accept who I am A badly burned girl with nowings With no fire And no sisterIn the dazzling white Capitol hospital the doctors worktheir magic on me Draping my rawness in new sheets ofskin Coaxing the cells into thinking they are my ownManipulating my body parts bending and stretching thelimbs to assure a good fit I hear over and over again howlucky I am My eyes were spared Most of my face wasspared My lungs are responding to treatment I will be asgood as newWhen my tender skin has toughened enough towithstand the pressure of sheets more visitors arrive Themorphling opens the door to the dead and alive alikeHaymitch yellow and unsmiling Cinna stitching a newwedding dress Delly prattling on about the niceness ofpeople My father sings all four stanzas of The HangingTree and reminds me that my motherwho sleeps in achair between shiftsisnt to know about itOne day I awake to expectations and know I will not beallowed to live in my dreamland I must take food by mouthMove my own muscles Make my way to the bathroom Abrief appearance by President Coin clinches itDont worry she says Ive saved him for youThe doctors puzzlement grows over why Im unable tospeak Many tests are done and while theres damage tomy vocal cords it doesnt account for it Finally DrAurelius a head doctor comes up with the theory that Ivebecome a mental rather than physical Avox That mysilence has been brought on by emotional trauma Althoughhes presented with a hundred proposed remedies he tellsthem to leave me alone So I dont ask about anyone oranything but people bring me a steady stream ofinformation On the war The Capitol fell the day theparachutes went off President Coin leads Panem now andtroops have been sent out to put down the small remainingpockets of Capitol resistance On President Snow Hesbeing held prisoner awaiting trial and most certainexecution On my assassination team Cressida and Polluxhave been sent out into the districts to cover the wreckageof the war Gale who took two bullets in an escape attemptis mopping up Peacekeepers in  Peetas still in the burnunit He made it to the City Circle after all On my family Mymother buries her grief in her workHaving no work grief buries me All that keeps megoing is Coins promise That I can kill Snow And whenthats done nothing will be leftEventually Im released from the hospital and given aroom in the presidents mansion to share with my motherShes almost never there taking her meals and sleeping atwork It falls to Haymitch to check on me make sure Imeating and using my medicines Its not an easy job I taketo my old habits from District  Wandering unauthorizedthrough the mansion Into bedrooms and offices ballroomsand baths Seeking strange little hiding spaces A closet offurs A cabinet in the library A longforgotten bathtub in aroom of discarded furniture My places are dim and quietand impossible to find I curl up make myself smaller try todisappear entirely Wrapped in silence I slide my braceletthat reads mentally disoriented around and around mywristMy name is Katniss Everdeen I am seventeen yearsold My home is District  There is no District  I amthe Mockingjay I brought down the Capitol PresidentSnow hates me He killed my sister Now I will kill himAnd then the Hunger Games will be overPeriodically I find myself back in my room unsurewhether I was driven by a need for morphling or if Haymitchferreted me out I eat the food take the medicine and amrequired to bathe Its not the water I mind but the mirrorthat reflects my naked firemutt body The skin grafts stillretain a newbornbaby pinkness The skin deemeddamaged but salvageable looks red hot and melted inplaces Patches of my former self gleam white and pale Imlike a bizarre patchwork quilt of skin Parts of my hair weresinged off completely the rest has been chopped off at oddlengths Katniss Everdeen the girl who was on fire Iwouldnt much care except the sight of my body brings backthe memory of the pain And why I was in pain And whathappened just before the pain started And how I watchedmy little sister become a human torchClosing my eyes doesnt help Fire burns brighter inthe darknessDr Aurelius shows up sometimes I like him becausehe doesnt say stupid things like how Im totally safe or thathe knows I cant see it but Ill be happy again one day oreven that things will be better in Panem now He just asks ifI feel like talking and when I dont answer he falls asleep inhis chair In fact I think his visits are largely motivated by hisneed for a nap The arrangement works for both of usThe time draws near although I could not give youexact hours and minutes President Snow has been triedand found guilty sentenced to execution Haymitch tells meI hear talk of it as I drift past the guards in the hallways MyMockingjay suit arrives in my room Also my bow lookingno worse for wear but no sheath of arrows Either becausethey were damaged or more likely because I shouldnt haveweapons I vaguely wonder if I should be preparing for theevent in some way but nothing comes to mindLate one afternoon after a long period in a cushionedwindow seat behind a painted screen I emerge and turnleft instead of right I find myself in a strange part of themansion and immediately lose my bearings Unlike thearea where Im quartered there seems to be no one aroundto ask I like it though Wish Id found it sooner Its so quietwith the thick carpets and heavy tapestries soaking up thesound Softly lit Muted colors Peaceful Until I smell theroses I dive behind some curtains shaking too hard to runwhile I await the mutts Finally I realize there are no muttscoming So what do I smell Real roses Could it be that Iam near the garden where the evil things growAs I creep down the hall the odor becomesoverpowering Perhaps not as strong as the actual muttsbut purer because its not competing with sewage andexplosives I turn a corner and find myself staring at twosurprised guards Not Peacekeepers of course There areno more Peacekeepers But not the trim grayuniformedsoldiers from  either These two a man and a womanwear the tattered throwntogether clothes of actual rebelsStill bandaged and gaunt they are now keeping watch overthe doorway to the roses When I move to enter their gunsform an X in front of meYou cant go in miss says the manSoldier the woman corrects him You cant go inSoldier Everdeen Presidents ordersI just stand there patiently waiting for them to lowertheir guns for them to understand without my telling themthat behind those doors is something I need Just a rose Asingle bloom To place in Snows lapel before I shoot himMy presence seems to worry the guards Theyrediscussing calling Haymitch when a woman speaks upbehind me Let her go inI know the voice but cant immediately place it NotSeam not  definitely not Capitol I turn my head and findmyself facetoface with Paylor the commander from She looks even more beat up than she did at the hospitalbut who doesntOn my authority says Paylor She has a right toanything behind that door These are her soldiers notCoins They drop their weapons without question and letme passAt the end of a short hallway I push apart the glassdoors and step inside By now the smells so strong that itbegins to flatten out as if theres no more my nose canabsorb The damp mild air feels good on my hot skin Andthe roses are glorious Row after row of sumptuous bloomsin lush pink sunset orange and even pale blue I wanderthrough the aisles of carefully pruned plants looking but nottouching because I have learned the hard way how deadlythese beauties can be I know when I find it crowning thetop of a slender bush A magnificent white bud justbeginning to open I pull my left sleeve over my hand so thatmy skin wont actually have to touch it take up a pair ofpruning shears and have just positioned them on the stemwhen he speaksThats a nice oneMy hand jerks the shears snap shut severing thestemThe colors are lovely of course but nothing saysperfection like whiteI still cant see him but his voice seems to rise up froman adjacent bed of red roses Delicately pinching the stemof the bud through the fabric of my sleeve I move slowlyaround the corner and find him sitting on a stool against thewall Hes as well groomed and finely dressed as ever butweighted down with manacles ankle shackles trackingdevices In the bright light his skins a pale sickly greenHe holds a white handkerchief spotted with fresh bloodEven in his deteriorated state his snake eyes shine brightand cold I was hoping youd find your way to my quartersHis quarters I have trespassed into his home the wayhe slithered into mine last year hissing threats with hisbloody rosy breath This greenhouse is one of his roomsperhaps his favorite perhaps in better times he tended theplants himself But now its part of his prison Thats why theguards halted me And thats why Paylor let me inId supposed he would be secured in the deepestdungeon that the Capitol had to offer not cradled in the lapof luxury Yet Coin left him here To set a precedent Iguess So that if in the future she ever fell from grace itwould be understood that presidentseven the mostdespicableget special treatment Who knows after allwhen her own power might fadeThere are so many things we should discuss but Ihave a feeling your visit will be brief So first things firstHe begins to cough and when he removes thehandkerchief from his mouth its redder I wanted to tellyou how very sorry I am about your sisterEven in my deadened drugged condition this sends astab of pain through me Reminding me that there are nolimits to his cruelty And how he will go to his grave trying todestroy meSo wasteful so unnecessary Anyone could see thegame was over by that point In fact I was just about toissue an official surrender when they released thoseparachutes His eyes are glued on me unblinking so asnot to miss a second of my reaction But what hes saidmakes no sense When they released the parachutesWell you really didnt think I gave the order did youForget the obvious fact that if Id had a working hovercraft atmy disposal Id have been using it to make an escape Butthat aside what purpose could it have served We bothknow Im not above killing children but Im not wasteful Itake life for very specific reasons And there was no reasonfor me to destroy a pen full of Capitol children None at allI wonder if the next fit of coughing is staged so that Ican have time to absorb his words Hes lying Of coursehes lying But theres something struggling to free itselffrom the lie as wellHowever I must concede it was a masterful move onCoins part The idea that I was bombing our own helplesschildren instantly snapped whatever frail allegiance mypeople still felt to me There was no real resistance afterthat Did you know it aired live You can see Plutarchshand there And in the parachutes Well its that sort ofthinking that you look for in a Head Gamemaker isnt itSnow dabs the corners of his mouth Im sure he wasntgunning for your sister but these things happenIm not with Snow now Im in Special Weaponry backin  with Gale and Beetee Looking at the designs basedon Gales traps That played on human sympathies Thefirst bomb killed the victims The second the rescuersRemembering Gales wordsBeetee and I have been following the same rulebook President Snow used when he hijacked PeetaMy failure says Snow was being so slow to graspCoins plan To let the Capitol and districts destroy oneanother and then step in to take power with Thirteen barelyscratched Make no mistake she was intending to take myplace right from the beginning I shouldnt be surprisedAfter all it was Thirteen that started the rebellion that led tothe Dark Days and then abandoned the rest of the districtswhen the tide turned against it But I wasnt watching Coin Iwas watching you Mockingjay And you were watching meIm afraid we have both been played for foolsI refuse for this to be true Some things even I cantsurvive I utter my first words since my sisters death I dontbelieve youSnow shakes his head in mock disappointment Ohmy dear Miss Everdeen I thought we had agreed not to lieto each otherOut in the hall I find Paylor standing in exactly thesame spot Did you find what you were looking for sheasksI hold up the white bud in answer and then stumblepast her I must have made it back to my room becausethe next thing I know Im filling a glass with water from thebathroom faucet and sticking the rose in it I sink to myknees on the cold tile and squint at the flower as thewhiteness seems hard to focus on in the stark fluorescentlight My finger catches the inside of my bracelet twisting itlike a tourniquet hurting my wrist Im hoping the pain willhelp me hang on to reality the way it did for Peeta I musthang on I must know the truth about what has happenedThere are two possibilities although the detailsassociated with them may vary First as Ive believed thatthe Capitol sent in that hovercraft dropped the parachutesand sacrificed its childrens lives knowing the recentlyarrived rebels would go to their aid Theres evidence tosupport this The Capitols seal on the hovercraft the lack ofany attempt to blow the enemy out of the sky and their longhistory of using children as pawns in their battle against thedistricts Then theres Snows account That a Capitolhovercraft manned by rebels bombed the children to bringa speedy end to the war But if this was the case why didntthe Capitol fire on the enemy Did the element of surprisethrow them Had they no defenses left Children areprecious to  or so it has always seemed Well not memaybe Once I had outlived my usefulness I wasexpendable Although I think its been a long time since Ivebeen considered a child in this war And why would they doit knowing their own medics would likely respond and betaken out by the second blast They wouldnt They couldntSnows lying Manipulating me as he always has Hoping toturn me against the rebels and possibly destroy them YesOf courseThen whats nagging at me Those doubleexplodingbombs for one Its not that the Capitol couldnt have thesame weapon its just that Im sure the rebels did Gale andBeetees brainchild Then theres the fact that Snow madeno escape attempt when I know him to be the consummatesurvivor It seems hard to believe he didnt have a retreatsomewhere some bunker stocked with provisions wherehe could live out the rest of his snaky little life And finallytheres his assessment of Coin Whats irrefutable is thatshes done exactly what he said Let the Capitol and thedistricts run one another into the ground and then saunteredin to take power Even if that was her plan it doesnt meanshe dropped those parachutes Victory was already in hergrasp Everything was in her graspExcept meI recall Boggss response when I admitted I hadnt putmuch thought into Snows successor If your immediateanswer isnt Coin then youre a threat Youre the face ofthe rebellion You may have more influence than anyother single person Outwardly the most youve ever doneis tolerated herSuddenly Im thinking of Prim who was not yetfourteen not yet old enough to be granted the title ofsoldier but somehow working on the front lines How didsuch a thing happen That my sister would have wanted tobe there I have no doubt That she would be more capablethan many older than she is a given But for all thatsomeone very high up would have had to approve putting athirteenyearold in combat Did Coin do it hoping thatlosing Prim would push me completely over the edge Orat least firmly on her side I wouldnt even have had towitness it in person Numerous cameras would be coveringthe City Circle Capturing the moment foreverNo now I am going crazy slipping into some state ofparanoia Too many people would know of the missionWord would get out Or would it Who would have to knowbesides Coin Plutarch and a small loyal or easilydisposable crewI badly need help working this out only everyone I trustis dead Cinna Boggs Finnick Prim Theres Peeta buthe couldnt do any more than speculate and who knowswhat state his minds in anyway And that leaves only GaleHes far away but even if he were beside me could Iconfide in him What could I say how could I phrase itwithout implying that it was his bomb that killed Prim Theimpossibility of that idea more than any is why Snow mustbe lyingUltimately theres only one person to turn to who mightknow what happened and might still be on my side Tobroach the subject at all will be a risk But while I thinkHaymitch might gamble with my life in the arena I dontthink hed rat me out to Coin Whatever problems we mayhave with each other we prefer resolving our differencesoneononeI scramble off the tiles out the door and across the hallto his room When theres no response to my knock I pushinside Ugh Its amazing how quickly he can defile a spaceHalfeaten plates of food shattered liquor bottles andpieces of broken furniture from a drunken rampage scatterhis quarters He lies unkempt and unwashed in a tangle ofsheets on the bed passed outHaymitch I say shaking his leg Of course thatsinsufficient But I give it a few more tries before I dump thepitcher of water in his face He comes to with a gaspslashing blindly with his knife Apparently the end of Snowsreign didnt equal the end of his terrorOh You he says I can tell by his voice that hes stillloadedHaymitch I beginListen to that The Mockingjay found her voice Helaughs Well Plutarchs going to be happy He takes aswig from a bottle Why am I soaking wet I lamely dropthe pitcher behind me into a pile of dirty clothesI need your help I sayHaymitch belches filling the air with white liquor fumesWhat is it sweetheart More boy trouble I dont knowwhy but this hurts me in a way Haymitch rarely can It mustshow on my face because even in his drunken state hetries to take it back Okay not funny Im already at thedoor Not funny Come back By the thud of his bodyhitting the floor I assume he tried to follow me but theresno pointI zigzag through the mansion and disappear into awardrobe full of silken things I yank them from hangers untilI have a pile and then burrow into it In the lining of mypocket I find a stray morphling tablet and swallow it dryheading off my rising hysteria Its not enough to right thingsthough I hear Haymitch calling me in the distance but hewont find me in his condition Especially not in this newspot Swathed in silk I feel like a caterpillar in a cocoonawaiting metamorphosis I always supposed that to be apeaceful condition At first it is But as I journey into night Ifeel more and more trapped suffocated by the slipperybindings unable to emerge until I have transformed intosomething of beauty I squirm trying to shed my ruinedbody and unlock the secret to growing flawless wingsDespite enormous effort I remain a hideous creature firedinto my current form by the blast from the bombsThe encounter with Snow opens the door to my oldrepertoire of nightmares Its like being stung by trackerjackers again A wave of horrifying images with a briefrespite I confuse with wakingonly to find another waveknocking me back When the guards finally locate me Imsitting on the floor of the wardrobe tangled in silkscreaming my head off I fight them at first until theyconvince me theyre trying to help peel away the chokinggarments and escort me back to my room On the way wepass a window and I see a gray snowy dawn spreadingacross the CapitolA very hungover Haymitch waits with a handful of pillsand a tray of food that neither of us has the stomach for Hemakes a feeble attempt to get me to talk again but seeingits pointless sends me to a bath someone has drawn Thetubs deep with three steps to the bottom I ease down intothe warm water and sit up to my neck in suds hoping themedicines kick in soon My eyes focus on the rose that hasspread its petals overnight filling the steamy air with itsstrong perfume I rise and reach for a towel to smother itwhen theres a tentative knock and the bathroom dooropens revealing three familiar faces They try to smile atme but even Venia cant conceal her shock at my ravagedmutt body Surprise Octavia squeaks and then burstsinto tears Im puzzling over their reappearance when Irealize that this must be it the day of the execution Theyvecome to prep me for the cameras Remake me to BeautyBase Zero No wonder Octavias crying Its an impossibletaskThey can barely touch my patchwork of skin for fear ofhurting me so I rinse and dry off myself I tell them I hardlynotice the pain anymore but Flavius still winces as hedrapes a robe around me In the bedroom I find anothersurprise Sitting upright in a chair Polished from hermetallic gold wig to her patent leather high heels gripping aclipboard Remarkably unchanged except for the vacantlook in her eyesEffie I sayHello Katniss She stands and kisses me on thecheek as if nothing has occurred since our last meeting thenight before the Quarter Quell Well it looks like weve gotanother big big big day ahead of us So why dont youstart your prep and Ill just pop over and check on thearrangementsOkay I say to her backThey say Plutarch and Haymitch had a hard timekeeping her alive comments Venia under her breath Shewas imprisoned after your escape so that helpsIts quite a stretch Effie Trinket rebel But I dont wantCoin killing her so I make a mental note to present her thatway if asked I guess its good Plutarch kidnapped youthree after allWere the only prep team still alive And all the stylistsfrom the Quarter Quell are dead says Venia She doesntsay who specifically killed them Im beginning to wonder ifit matters She gingerly takes one of my scarred hands andholds it out for inspection Now what do you think for thenails Red or maybe a jet blackFlavius performs some beauty miracle on my hairmanaging to even out the front while getting some of thelonger locks to hide the bald spots in the back My facesince it was spared from the flames presents no more thanthe usual challenges Once Im in Cinnas Mockingjay suitthe only scars visible are on my neck forearms and handsOctavia secures my Mockingjay pin over my heart and westep back to look in the mirror I cant believe how normaltheyve made me look on the outside when inwardly Imsuch a wastelandTheres a tap at the door and Gale steps in Can Ihave a minute he asks In the mirror I watch my prepteam Unsure of where to go they bump into one another afew times and then closet themselves in the bathroom Galecomes up behind me and we examine each othersreflection Im searching for something to hang on to somesign of the girl and boy who met by chance in the woodsfive years ago and became inseparable Im wonderingwhat would have happened to them if the Hunger Gameshad not reaped the girl If she would have fallen in love withthe boy married him even And sometime in the futurewhen the brothers and sisters had been raised upescaped with him into the woods and left  behind foreverWould they have been happy out in the wild or would thedark twisted sadness between them have grown up evenwithout the Capitols helpI brought you this Gale holds up a sheath When Itake it I notice it holds a single ordinary arrow Itssupposed to be symbolic You firing the last shot of thewarWhat if I miss I say Does Coin retrieve it and bringit back to me Or just shoot Snow through the headherselfYou wont miss Gale adjusts the sheath on myshoulderWe stand there facetoface not meeting each otherseyes You didnt come see me in the hospital He doesntanswer so finally I just say it Was it your bombI dont know Neither does Beetee he says Does itmatter Youll always be thinking about itHe waits for me to deny it I want to deny it but its trueEven now I can see the flash that ignites her feel the heat ofthe flames And I will never be able to separate thatmoment from Gale My silence is my answerThat was the one thing I had going for me Takingcare of your family he says Shoot straight okay Hetouches my cheek and leaves I want to call him back andtell him that I was wrong That Ill figure out a way to makepeace with this To remember the circumstances underwhich he created the bomb Take into account my owninexcusable crimes Dig up the truth about who dropped theparachutes Prove it wasnt the rebels Forgive him Butsince I cant Ill just have to deal with the painEffie comes in to usher me to some kind of meeting Icollect my bow and at the last minute remember the roseglistening in its glass of water When I open the door to thebathroom I find my prep team sitting in a row on the edgeof the tub hunched and defeated I remember Im not theonly one whose world has been stripped away Come onI tell them Weve got an audience waitingIm expecting a production meeting in which Plutarchinstructs me where to stand and gives me my cue forshooting Snow Instead I find myself sent into a roomwhere six people sit around a table Peeta JohannaBeetee Haymitch Annie and Enobaria They all wear thegray rebel uniforms from  No one looks particularly wellWhats this I sayWere not sure Haymitch answers It appears to bea gathering of the remaining victorsWere all thats left I askThe price of celebrity says Beetee We weretargeted from both sides The Capitol killed the victors theysuspected of being rebels The rebels killed those thoughtto be allied with the CapitolJohanna scowls at Enobaria So whats she doinghereShe is protected under what we call the MockingjayDeal says Coin as she enters behind me WhereinKatniss Everdeen agreed to support the rebels inexchange for captured victors immunity Katniss hasupheld her side of the bargain and so shall weEnobaria smiles at Johanna Dont look so smugsays Johanna Well kill you anywaySit down please Katniss says Coin closing thedoor I take a seat between Annie and Beetee carefullyplacing Snows rose on the table As usual Coin gets rightto the point Ive asked you here to settle a debate Todaywe will execute Snow In the previous weeks hundreds ofhis accomplices in the oppression of Panem have beentried and now await their own deaths However thesuffering in the districts has been so extreme that thesemeasures appear insufficient to the victims In fact manyare calling for a complete annihilation of those who heldCapitol citizenship However in the interest of maintaininga sustainable population we cannot afford thisThrough the water in the glass I see a distorted imageof one of Peetas hands The burn marks We are both firemutts now My eyes travel up to where the flames lickedacross his forehead singeing away his brows but justmissing his eyes Those same blue eyes that used to meetmine and then flit away at school Just as they do nowSo an alternative has been placed on the tableSince my colleagues and I can come to no consensus ithas been agreed that we will let the victors decide Amajority of four will approve the plan No one may abstainfrom the vote says Coin What has been proposed is thatin lieu of eliminating the entire Capitol population we havea final symbolic Hunger Games using the children directlyrelated to those who held the most powerAll seven of us turn to her What says JohannaWe hold another Hunger Games using Capitolchildren says CoinAre you joking asks PeetaNo I should also tell you that if we do hold the Gamesit will be known it was done with your approval although theindividual breakdown of your votes will be kept secret foryour own security Coin tells usWas this Plutarchs idea asks HaymitchIt was mine says Coin It seemed to balance theneed for vengeance with the least loss of life You may castyour votesNo bursts out Peeta I vote no of course We canthave another Hunger GamesWhy not Johanna retorts It seems very fair to meSnow even has a granddaughter I vote yesSo do I says Enobaria almost indifferently Letthem have a taste of their own medicineThis is why we rebelled Remember Peeta looks atthe rest of us AnnieI vote no with Peeta she says So would Finnick ifhe were hereBut he isnt because Snows mutts killed himJohanna reminds herNo says Beetee It would set a bad precedent Wehave to stop viewing one another as enemies At this pointunity is essential for our survival NoWere down to Katniss and Haymitch says CoinWas it like this then Seventyfive years or so agoDid a group of people sit around and cast their votes oninitiating the Hunger Games Was there dissent Didsomeone make a case for mercy that was beaten down bythe calls for the deaths of the districts children The scentof Snows rose curls up into my nose down into my throatsqueezing it tight with despair All those people I loveddead and we are discussing the next Hunger Games in anattempt to avoid wasting life Nothing has changed Nothingwill ever change nowI weigh my options carefully think everything throughKeeping my eyes on the rose I say I vote yesfor PrimHaymitch its up to you says CoinA furious Peeta hammers Haymitch with the atrocity hecould become party to but I can feel Haymitch watchingme This is the moment then When we find out exactly justhow alike we are and how much he truly understands meIm with the Mockingjay he saysExcellent That carries the vote says Coin Now wereally must take our places for the executionAs she passes me I hold up the glass with the roseCan you see that Snows wearing this Just over hisheartCoin smiles Of course And Ill make sure he knowsabout the GamesThank you I sayPeople sweep into the room surround me The lasttouch of powder the instructions from Plutarch as Imguided to the front doors of the mansion The City Circleruns over spills people down the side streets The otherstake their places outside Guards Officials Rebel leadersVictors I hear the cheers that indicate Coin has appearedon the balcony Then Effie taps my shoulder and I step outinto the cold winter sunlight Walk to my positionaccompanied by the deafening roar of the crowd Asdirected I turn so they see me in profile and wait Whenthey march Snow out the door the audience goes insaneThey secure his hands behind a post which isunnecessary Hes not going anywhere Theres nowhere togo This is not the roomy stage before the Training Centerbut the narrow terrace in front of the presidents mansionNo wonder no one bothered to have me practice Hes tenyards awayI feel the bow purring in my hand Reach back andgrasp the arrow Position it aim at the rose but watch hisface He coughs and a bloody dribble runs down his chinHis tongue flicks over his puffy lips I search his eyes for theslightest sign of anything fear remorse anger But theresonly the same look of amusement that ended our lastconversation Its as if hes speaking the words again Ohmy dear Miss Everdeen I thought we had agreed not tolie to each otherHes right We didThe point of my arrow shifts upward I release thestring And President Coin collapses over the side of thebalcony and plunges to the ground DeadIn the stunned reaction that follows Im aware of onesound Snows laughter An awful gurgling cackleaccompanied by an eruption of foamy blood when thecoughing begins I see him bend forward spewing out hislife until the guards block him from my sightAs the gray uniforms begin to converge on me I thinkof what my brief future as the assassin of Panems newpresident holds The interrogation probable torture certainpublic execution Having yet again to say my finalgoodbyes to the handful of people who still maintain a holdon my heart The prospect of facing my mother who willnow be entirely alone in the world decides itGood night I whisper to the bow in my hand and feelit go still I raise my left arm and twist my neck down to ripoff the pill on my sleeve Instead my teeth sink into flesh Iyank my head back in confusion to find myself looking intoPeetas eyes only now they hold my gaze Blood runs fromthe teeth marks on the hand he clamped over my nightlockLet me go I snarl at him trying to wrest my arm from hisgraspI cant he says As they pull me away from him I feelthe pocket ripped from my sleeve see the deep violet pillfall to the ground watch Cinnas last gift get crunched undera guards boot I transform into a wild animal kickingclawing biting doing whatever I can to free myself from thisweb of hands as the crowd pushes in The guards lift me upabove the fray where I continue to thrash as Im conveyedover the crush of people I start screaming for Gale I cantfind him in the throng but he will know what I want A goodclean shot to end it all Only theres no arrow no bullet Is itpossible he cant see me No Above us on the giantscreens placed around the City Circle everyone can watchthe whole thing being played out He sees he knows buthe doesnt follow through Just as I didnt when he wascaptured Sorry excuses for hunters and friends Both of usIm on my ownIn the mansion they handcuff and blindfold me Im halfdragged half carried down long passages up and downelevators and deposited on a carpeted floor The cuffs areremoved and a door slams closed behind me When I pushthe blindfold up I find Im in my old room at the TrainingCenter The one where I lived during those last preciousdays before my first Hunger Games and the Quarter QuellThe beds stripped to the mattress the closet gapes openshowing the emptiness inside but Id know this roomanywhereIts a struggle to get to my feet and peel off myMockingjay suit Im badly bruised and might have a brokenfinger or two but its my skin thats paid most dearly for mystruggle with the guards The new pink stuff has shreddedlike tissue paper and blood seeps through the laboratorygrowncells No medics show up though and as Im too fargone to care I crawl up onto the mattress expecting tobleed to deathNo such luck By evening the blood clots leaving mestiff and sore and sticky but alive I limp into the shower andprogram in the gentlest cycle I can remember free of anysoaps and hair products and squat under the warm sprayelbows on my knees head in my handsMy name is Katniss Everdeen Why am I not dead Ishould be dead It would be best for everyone if I weredeadWhen I step out on the mat the hot air bakes mydamaged skin dry Theres nothing clean to put on Noteven a towel to wrap around me Back in the room I findthe Mockingjay suit has disappeared In its place is a paperrobe A meal has been sent up from the mysterious kitchenwith a container of my medications for dessert I go aheadand eat the food take the pills rub the salve on my skin Ineed to focus now on the manner of my suicideI curl back up on the bloodstained mattress not coldbut feeling so naked with just the paper to cover my tenderflesh Jumping to my deaths not an optionthe windowglass must be a foot thick I can make an excellent noosebut theres nothing to hang myself from Its possible I couldhoard my pills and then knock myself off with a lethal doseexcept that Im sure Im being watched round the clock Forall I know Im on live television at this very moment whilecommentators try to analyze what could possibly havemotivated me to kill Coin The surveillance makes almostany suicide attempt impossible Taking my life is theCapitols privilege AgainWhat I can do is give up I resolve to lie on the bedwithout eating drinking or taking my medications I coulddo it too Just die If it werent for the morphling withdrawalNot bit by bit like in the hospital in  but cold turkey I musthave been on a fairly large dose because when the cravingfor it hits accompanied by tremors and shooting painsand unbearable cold my resolves crushed like an eggshellIm on my knees raking the carpet with my fingernails tofind those precious pills I flung away in a stronger moment Irevise my suicide plan to slow death by morphling I willbecome a yellowskinned bag of bones with enormouseyes Im a couple of days into the plan making goodprogress when something unexpected happensI begin to sing At the window in the shower in mysleep Hour after hour of ballads love songs mountain airsAll the songs my father taught me before he died forcertainly there has been very little music in my life sinceWhats amazing is how clearly I remember them The tunesthe lyrics My voice at first rough and breaking on the highnotes warms up into something splendid A voice thatwould make the mockingjays fall silent and then tumble overthemselves to join in Days pass weeks I watch the snowsfall on the ledge outside my window And in all that timemine is the only voice I hearWhat are they doing anyway Whats the holdup outthere How difficult can it be to arrange the execution ofone murderous girl I continue with my own annihilation Mybodys thinner than its ever been and my battle againsthunger is so fierce that sometimes the animal part of megives in to the temptation of buttered bread or roastedmeat But still Im winning For a few days I feel quite unwelland think I may finally be traveling out of this life when Irealize my morphling tablets are shrinking They are tryingto slowly wean me off the stuff But why Surely a druggedMockingjay will be easier to dispose of in front of a crowdAnd then a terrible thought hits me What if theyre not goingto kill me What if they have more plans for me A new wayto remake train and use meI wont do it If I cant kill myself in this room I will takethe first opportunity outside of it to finish the job They canfatten me up They can give me a full body polish dress meup and make me beautiful again They can design dreamweapons that come to life in my hands but they will neveragain brainwash me into the necessity of using them I nolonger feel any allegiance to these monsters called humanbeings despise being one myself I think that Peeta wasonto something about us destroying one another and lettingsome decent species take over Because something issignificantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices itschildrens lives to settle its differences You can spin it anyway you like Snow thought the Hunger Games were anefficient means of control Coin thought the parachuteswould expedite the war But in the end who does it benefitNo one The truth is it benefits no one to live in a worldwhere these things happenAfter two days of my lying on my mattress with noattempt to eat drink or even take a morphling tablet thedoor to my room opens Someone crosses around the bedinto my field of vision Haymitch Your trials over he saysCome on Were going homeHome Whats he talking about My homes goneAnd even if it were possible to go to this imaginary place Iam too weak to move Strangers appear Rehydrate andfeed me Bathe and clothe me One lifts me like a rag dolland carries me up to the roof onto a hovercraft andfastens me into a seat Haymitch and Plutarch sit acrossfrom me In a few moments were airborneIve never seen Plutarch in such a good mood Hespositively glowing You must have a million questionsWhen I dont respond he answers them anywayAfter I shot Coin there was pandemonium When theruckus died down they discovered Snows body stilltethered to the post Opinions differ on whether he chokedto death while laughing or was crushed by the crowd Noone really cares An emergency election was throwntogether and Paylor was voted in as president Plutarchwas appointed secretary of communications which meanshe sets the programming for the airwaves The first bigtelevised event was my trial in which he was also a starwitness In my defense of course Although most of thecredit for my exoneration must be given to Dr Aurelius whoapparently earned his naps by presenting me as ahopeless shellshocked lunatic One condition for myrelease is that Ill continue under his care although it willhave to be by phone because hed never live in a forsakenplace like  and Im confined there until further notice Thetruth is no one quite knows what to do with me now that thewars over although if another one should spring upPlutarchs sure they could find a role for me Then Plutarchhas a good laugh It never seems to bother him when noone else appreciates his jokesAre you preparing for another war Plutarch I askOh not now Now were in that sweet period whereeveryone agrees that our recent horrors should never berepeated he says But collective thinking is usually shortlivedWere fickle stupid beings with poor memories and agreat gift for selfdestruction Although who knows Maybethis will be it KatnissWhat I askThe time it sticks Maybe we are witnessing theevolution of the human race Think about that And then heasks me if Id like to perform on a new singing program heslaunching in a few weeks Something upbeat would begood Hell send the crew to my houseWe land briefly in District  to drop off Plutarch Hesmeeting with Beetee to update the technology on thebroadcast system His parting words to me are Dont be astrangerWhen were back among the clouds I look atHaymitch So why are you going back to TwelveThey cant seem to find a place for me in the Capitoleither he saysAt first I dont question this But doubts begin to creepin Haymitch hasnt assassinated anyone He could goanywhere If hes coming back to  its because hes beenordered to You have to look after me dont you As mymentor He shrugs Then I realize what it means Mymothers not coming backNo he says He pulls an envelope from his jacketpocket and hands it to me I examine the delicate perfectlyformed writing Shes helping to start up a hospital inDistrict Four She wants you to call as soon as we get inMy finger traces the graceful swoop of the letters Youknow why she cant come back Yes I know why Becausebetween my father and Prim and the ashes the place is toopainful to bear But apparently not for me Do you want toknow who else wont be thereNo I say I want to be surprisedLike a good mentor Haymitch makes me eat asandwich and then pretends he believes Im asleep for therest of the trip He busies himself going through everycompartment on the hovercraft finding the liquor andstowing it in his bag Its night when we land on the green ofthe Victors Village Half of the houses have lights in thewindows including Haymitchs and mine Not PeetasSomeone has built a fire in my kitchen I sit in the rockerbefore it clutching my mothers letterWell see you tomorrow says HaymitchAs the clinking of his bag of liquor bottles fades away Iwhisper I doubt itI am unable to move from the chair The rest of thehouse looms cold and empty and dark I pull an old shawlover my body and watch the flames I guess I sleepbecause the next thing I know its morning and GreasySaes banging around at the stove She makes me eggsand toast and sits there until Ive eaten it all We dont talkmuch Her little granddaughter the one who lives in her ownworld takes a bright blue ball of yarn from my mothersknitting basket Greasy Sae tells her to put it back but I sayshe can have it No one in this house can knit anymoreAfter breakfast Greasy Sae does the dishes and leavesbut she comes back up at dinnertime to make me eatagain I dont know if shes just being neighborly or if sheson the governments payroll but she shows up twice everyday She cooks I consume I try to figure out my next moveTheres no obstacle now to taking my life But I seem to bewaiting for somethingSometimes the phone rings and rings and rings but Idont pick it up Haymitch never visits Maybe he changedhis mind and left although I suspect hes just drunk No onecomes but Greasy Sae and her granddaughter Aftermonths of solitary confinement they seem like a crowdSprings in the air today You ought to get out shesays Go huntingI havent left the house I havent even left the kitchenexcept to go to the small bathroom a few steps off of it Imin the same clothes I left the Capitol in What I do is sit bythe fire Stare at the unopened letters piling up on themantel I dont have a bowCheck down the hall she saysAfter she leaves I consider a trip down the hall Rule itout But after several hours I go anyway walking in silentsock feet so as not to awaken the ghosts In the studywhere I had my tea with President Snow I find a box withmy fathers hunting jacket our plant book my parentswedding photo the spile Haymitch sent in and the locketPeeta gave me in the clock arena The two bows and asheath of arrows Gale rescued on the night of thefirebombing lie on the desk I put on the hunting jacket andleave the rest of the stuff untouched I fall asleep on the sofain the formal living room A terrible nightmare follows whereIm lying at the bottom of a deep grave and every deadperson I know by name comes by and throws a shovel full ofashes on me Its quite a long dream considering the list ofpeople and the deeper Im buried the harder it is tobreathe I try to call out begging them to stop but the ashesfill my mouth and nose and I cant make any sound Still theshovel scrapes on and on and onI wake with a start Pale morning light comes aroundthe edges of the shutters The scraping of the shovelcontinues Still half in the nightmare I run down the hall outthe front door and around the side of the house becausenow Im pretty sure I can scream at the dead When I seehim I pull up short His face is flushed from digging up theground under the windows In a wheelbarrow are fivescraggly bushesYoure back I sayDr Aurelius wouldnt let me leave the Capitol untilyesterday Peeta says By the way he said to tell you hecant keep pretending hes treating you forever You have topick up the phoneHe looks well Thin and covered with burn scars likeme but his eyes have lost that clouded tortured look Hesfrowning slightly though as he takes me in I make ahalfhearted effort to push my hair out of my eyes and realizeits matted into clumps I feel defensive What are youdoingI went to the woods this morning and dug these upFor her he says I thought we could plant them along theside of the houseI look at the bushes the clods of dirt hanging from theirroots and catch my breath as the word rose registers Imabout to yell vicious things at Peeta when the full namecomes to me Not plain rose but evening primrose Theflower my sister was named for I give Peeta a nod ofassent and hurry back into the house locking the doorbehind me But the evil thing is inside not out Tremblingwith weakness and anxiety I run up the stairs My footcatches on the last step and I crash onto the floor I forcemyself to rise and enter my room The smells very faint butstill laces the air Its there The white rose among the driedflowers in the vase Shriveled and fragile but holding on tothat unnatural perfection cultivated in Snows greenhouse Igrab the vase stumble down to the kitchen and throw itscontents into the embers As the flowers flare up a burst ofblue flame envelops the rose and devours it Fire beatsroses again I smash the vase on the floor for goodmeasureBack upstairs I throw open the bedroom windows toclear out the rest of Snows stench But it still lingers on myclothes and in my pores I strip and flakes of skin the sizeof playing cards cling to the garments Avoiding the mirror Istep into the shower and scrub the roses from my hair mybody my mouth Bright pink and tingling I find somethingclean to wear It takes half an hour to comb out my hairGreasy Sae unlocks the front door While she makesbreakfast I feed the clothes I had shed to the fire At hersuggestion I pare off my nails with a knifeOver the eggs I ask her Where did Gale goDistrict Two Got some fancy job there I see him nowand again on the television she saysI dig around inside myself trying to register angerhatred longing I find only reliefIm going hunting today I sayWell I wouldnt mind some fresh game at that sheanswersI arm myself with a bow and arrows and head outintending to exit  through the Meadow Near the squareare teams of masked and gloved people with horsedrawncarts Sifting through what lay under the snow this winterGathering remains A carts parked in front of the mayorshouse I recognize Thom Gales old crewmate pausing amoment to wipe the sweat from his face with a rag Iremember seeing him in  but he must have come backHis greeting gives me the courage to ask Did they findanyone in thereWhole family And the two people who worked forthem Thom tells meMadge Quiet and kind and brave The girl who gaveme the pin that gave me a name I swallow hard Wonder ifshell be joining the cast of my nightmares tonightShoveling the ashes into my mouth I thought maybe sincehe was the mayorI dont think being the mayor of Twelve put the odds inhis favor says ThomI nod and keep moving careful not to look in the backof the cart All through the town and the Seam its thesame The reaping of the dead As I near the ruins of myold house the road becomes thick with carts TheMeadows gone or at least dramatically altered A deep pithas been dug and theyre lining it with bones a massgrave for my people I skirt around the hole and enter thewoods at my usual place It doesnt matter though Thefence isnt charged anymore and has been propped up withlong branches to keep out the predators But old habits diehard I think about going to the lake but Im so weak that Ibarely make it to my meeting place with Gale I sit on therock where Cressida filmed us but its too wide without hisbody beside me Several times I close my eyes and countto ten thinking that when I open them he will havematerialized without a sound as he so often did I have toremind myself that Gales in  with a fancy job probablykissing another pair of lipsIt is the old Katnisss favorite kind of day Early springThe woods awakening after the long winter But the spurt ofenergy that began with the primroses fades away By thetime I make it back to the fence Im so sick and dizzyThom has to give me a ride home in the dead peoplescart Help me to the sofa in the living room where I watchthe dust motes spin in the thin shafts of afternoon lightMy head snaps around at the hiss but it takes awhileto believe hes real How could he have gotten here I takein the claw marks from some wild animal the back paw heholds slightly above the ground the prominent bones in hisface Hes come on foot then all the way from  Maybethey kicked him out or maybe he just couldnt stand it therewithout her so he came lookingIt was the waste of a trip Shes not here I tell himButtercup hisses again Shes not here You can hiss allyou like You wont find Prim At her name he perks upRaises his flattened ears Begins to meow hopefully Getout He dodges the pillow I throw at him Go awayTheres nothing left for you here I start to shake furiouswith him Shes not coming back Shes never ever comingback here again I grab another pillow and get to my feetto improve my aim Out of nowhere the tears begin to pourdown my cheeks Shes dead I clutch my middle to dullthe pain Sink down on my heels rocking the pillow cryingShes dead you stupid cat Shes dead A new soundpart crying part singing comes out of my body givingvoice to my despair Buttercup begins to wail as well Nomatter what I do he wont go He circles me just out ofreach as wave after wave of sobs racks my body untileventually I fall unconscious But he must understand Hemust know that the unthinkable has happened and tosurvive will require previously unthinkable acts Becausehours later when I come to in my bed hes there in themoonlight Crouched beside me yellow eyes alertguarding me from the nightIn the morning he sits stoically as I clean the cuts butdigging the thorn from his paw brings on a round of thosekitten mews We both end up crying again only this time wecomfort each other On the strength of this I open the letterHaymitch gave me from my mother dial the phone numberand weep with her as well Peeta bearing a warm loaf ofbread shows up with Greasy Sae She makes us breakfastand I feed all my bacon to ButtercupSlowly with many lost days I come back to life I try tofollow Dr Aureliuss advice just going through the motionsamazed when one finally has meaning again I tell him myidea about the book and a large box of parchment sheetsarrives on the next train from the CapitolI got the idea from our familys plant book The placewhere we recorded those things you cannot trust tomemory The page begins with the persons picture Aphoto if we can find it If not a sketch or painting by PeetaThen in my most careful handwriting come all the details itwould be a crime to forget Lady licking Prims cheek Myfathers laugh Peetas father with the cookies The color ofFinnicks eyes What Cinna could do with a length of silkBoggs reprogramming the Holo Rue poised on her toesarms slightly extended like a bird about to take flight Onand on We seal the pages with salt water and promises tolive well to make their deaths count Haymitch finally joinsus contributing twentythree years of tributes he was forcedto mentor Additions become smaller An old memory thatsurfaces A late primrose preserved between the pagesStrange bits of happiness like the photo of Finnick andAnnies newborn sonWe learn to keep busy again Peeta bakes I huntHaymitch drinks until the liquor runs out and then raisesgeese until the next train arrives Fortunately the geese cantake pretty good care of themselves Were not alone Afew hundred others return because whatever hashappened this is our home With the mines closed theyplow the ashes into the earth and plant food Machines fromthe Capitol break ground for a new factory where we willmake medicines Although no one seeds it the Meadowturns green againPeeta and I grow back together There are stillmoments when he clutches the back of a chair and hangson until the flashbacks are over I wake screaming fromnightmares of mutts and lost children But his arms arethere to comfort me And eventually his lips On the night Ifeel that thing again the hunger that overtook me on thebeach I know this would have happened anyway That whatI need to survive is not Gales fire kindled with rage andhatred I have plenty of fire myself What I need is thedandelion in the spring The bright yellow that means rebirthinstead of destruction The promise that life can go on nomatter how bad our losses That it can be good again Andonly Peeta can give me thatSo after when he whispers You love me Real or notrealI tell him RealEPILOGUEThey play in the Meadow The dancing girl with thedark hair and blue eyes The boy with blond curls and grayeyes struggling to keep up with her on his chubby toddlerlegs It took five ten fifteen years for me to agree ButPeeta wanted them so badly When I first felt her stirringinside of me I was consumed with a terror that felt as oldas life itself Only the joy of holding her in my arms couldtame it Carrying him was a little easier but not muchThe questions are just beginning The arenas havebeen completely destroyed the memorials built there areno more Hunger Games But they teach about them atschool and the girl knows we played a role in them Theboy will know in a few years How can I tell them about thatworld without frightening them to death My children whotake the words of the song for grantedDeep in the meadow under the willowA bed of grass a soft green pillowLay down your head and close your sleepyeyesAnd when again they open the sun will riseHere its safe here its warmHere the daisies guard you from every harmHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrowbrings them trueHere is the place where I love youMy children who dont know they play on a graveyardPeeta says it will be okay We have each other Andthe book We can make them understand in a way that willmake them braver But one day Ill have to explain about mynightmares Why they came Why they wont ever really goawayIll tell them how I survive it Ill tell them that on badmornings it feels impossible to take pleasure in anythingbecause Im afraid it could be taken away Thats when Imake a list in my head of every act of goodness Ive seensomeone do Its like a game Repetitive Even a littletedious after more than twenty yearsBut there are much worse games to playTHE ENDACKNOWLEDGMENTSI would like to pay tribute to the following people whogave their time talent and support to The Hunger GamesFirst off I must thank my

stood Over there was thekitchen table The bricks of the chimney which collapsed ina charred heap provide a point of reference for the rest ofthe house How else could I orient myself in this sea ofgrayAlmost nothing remains of District  A month agothe Capitols firebombs obliterated the poor coal minershouses in the Seam the shops in the town even the JusticeBuilding The only area that escaped incineration was theVictors Village I dont know why exactly Perhaps soanyone forced to come here on Capitol business wouldhave somewhere decent to stay The odd reporter Acommittee assessing the condition of the coal mines Asquad of Peacekeepers checking for returning refugeesBut no one is returning except me And thats only for abrief visit The authorities in District  were against mycoming back They viewed it as a costly and pointlessventure given that at least a dozen invisible hovercraft arecircling overhead for my protection and theres nointelligence to be gained I had to see it though So muchso that I made it a condition of my cooperating with any oftheir plansFinally Plutarch Heavensbee the Head Gamemakerwho had organized the rebels in the Capitol threw up hishands Let her go Better to waste a day than anothermonth Maybe a little tour of Twelve is just what she needsto convince her were on the same sideThe same side A pain stabs my left temple and Ipress my hand against it Right on the spot where JohannaMason hit me with the coil of wire The memories swirl as Itry to sort out what is true and what is false What series ofevents led me to be standing in the ruins of my city This ishard because the effects of the concussion she gave mehavent completely subsided and my thoughts still have atendency to jumble together Also the drugs they use tocontrol my pain and mood sometimes make me see thingsI guess Im still not entirely convinced that I washallucinating the night the floor of my hospital roomtransformed into a carpet of writhing snakesI use a technique one of the doctors suggested I startwith the simplest things I know to be true and work towardthe more complicated The list begins to roll in my headMy name is Katniss Everdeen I am seventeen yearsold My home is District  I was in the Hunger Games Iescaped The Capitol hates me Peeta was takenprisoner He is thought to be dead Most likely he is deadIt is probably best if he is deadKatniss Should I come down My best friend Galesvoice reaches me through the headset the rebels insisted Iwear Hes up in a hovercraft watching me carefully readyto swoop in if anything goes amiss I realize Im croucheddown now elbows on my thighs my head braced betweenmy hands I must look on the verge of some kind ofbreakdown This wont do Not when theyre finally weaningme off the medicationI straighten up and wave his offer away No Im fineTo reinforce this I begin to move away from my old houseand in toward the town Gale asked to be dropped off in with me but he didnt force the issue when I refused hiscompany He understands I dont want anyone with metoday Not even him Some walks you have to take aloneThe summers been scorching hot and dry as a boneTheres been next to no rain to disturb the piles of ash leftby the attack They shift here and there in reaction to myfootsteps No breeze to scatter them I keep my eyes onwhat I remember as the road because when I first landed inthe Meadow I wasnt careful and I walked right into a rockOnly it wasnt a rockit was someones skull It rolled overand over and landed faceup and for a long time I couldntstop looking at the teeth wondering whose they werethinking of how mine would probably look the same wayunder similar circumstancesI stick to the road out of habit but its a bad choicebecause its full of the remains of those who tried to fleeSome were incinerated entirely But others probablyovercome with smoke escaped the worst of the flames andnow lie reeking in various states of decomposition carrionfor scavengers blanketed by flies I killed you I think as Ipass a pile And you And youBecause I did It was my arrow aimed at the chink inthe force field surrounding the arena that brought on thisfirestorm of retribution That sent the whole country ofPanem into chaosIn my head I hear President Snows words spoken themorning I was to begin the Victory Tour KatnissEverdeen the girl who was on fire you have provided aspark that left unattended may grow to an inferno thatdestroys Panem It turns out he wasnt exaggerating orsimply trying to scare me He was perhaps genuinelyattempting to enlist my help But I had already setsomething in motion that I had no ability to controlBurning Still burning I think numbly The fires at thecoal mines belch black smoke in the distance Theres noone left to care though More than ninety percent of thedistricts population is dead The remaining eight hundredor so are refugees in District which as far as Imconcerned is the same thing as being homeless foreverI know I shouldnt think that I know I should be gratefulfor the way we have been welcomed Sick woundedstarving and emptyhanded Still I can never get aroundthe fact that District  was instrumental in s destructionThis doesnt absolve me of blametheres plenty of blameto go around But without them I would not have been partof a larger plot to overthrow the Capitol or had thewherewithal to do itThe citizens of District  had no organized resistancemovement of their own No say in any of this They only hadthe misfortune to have me Some survivors think its goodluck though to be free of District  at last To haveescaped the endless hunger and oppression the perilousmines the lash of our final Head Peacekeeper RomulusThread To have a new home at all is seen as a wondersince up until a short time ago we hadnt even known thatDistrict  still existedThe credit for the survivors escape has landedsquarely on Gales shoulders although hes loath to acceptit As soon as the Quarter Quell was overas soon as I hadbeen lifted from the arenathe electricity in District  wascut the televisions went black and the Seam became sosilent people could hear one anothers heartbeats No onedid anything to protest or celebrate what had happened inthe arena Yet within fifteen minutes the sky was filled withhoverplanes and the bombs were raining downIt was Gale who thought of the Meadow one of the fewplaces not filled with old wooden homes embedded withcoal dust He herded those he could in its directionincluding my mother and Prim He formed the team thatpulled down the fencenow just a harmless chainlinkbarrier with the electricity offand led the people into thewoods He took them to the only place he could think of thelake my father had shown me as a child And it was fromthere they watched the distant flames eat up everything theyknew in the worldBy dawn the bombers were long gone the fires dyingthe final stragglers rounded up My mother and Prim hadset up a medical area for the injured and were attemptingto treat them with whatever they could glean from thewoods Gale had two sets of bows and arrows one huntingknife one fishing net and over eight hundred terrifiedpeople to feed With the help of those who were ablebodiedthey managed for three days And thats when thehovercraft unexpectedly arrived to evacuate them to District where there were more than enough clean white livingcompartments plenty of clothing and three meals a dayThe compartments had the disadvantage of beingunderground the clothing was identical and the food wasrelatively tasteless but for the refugees of  these wereminor considerations They were safe They were beingcared for They were alive and eagerly welcomedThis enthusiasm was interpreted as kindness But aman named Dalton a District  refugee whod made it to on foot a few years ago leaked the real motive to meThey need you Me They need us all Awhile back therewas some sort of pox epidemic that killed a bunch of themand left a lot more infertile New breeding stock Thats howthey see us Back in  hed worked on one of the beefranches maintaining the genetic diversity of the herd withthe implantation of longfrozen cow embryos Hes verylikely right about  because there dont seem to be nearlyenough kids around But so what Were not being kept inpens were being trained for work the children are beingeducated Those over fourteen have been given entrylevelranks in the military and are addressed respectfully asSoldier Every single refugee was granted automaticcitizenship by the authorities of Still I hate them But of course I hate almosteverybody now Myself more than anyoneThe surface beneath my feet hardens and under thecarpet of ash I feel the paving stones of the square Aroundthe perimeter is a shallow border of refuse where the shopsstood A heap of blackened rubble has replaced theJustice Building I walk to the approximate site of thebakery Peetas family owned Nothing much left but themelted lump of the oven Peetas parents his two olderbrothersnone of them made it to  Fewer than a dozenof what passed for District s welltodo escaped the firePeeta would have nothing to come home to anywayExcept meI back away from the bakery and bump into somethinglose my balance and find myself sitting on a hunk of sunheatedmetal I puzzle over what it might have been thenremember Threads recent renovations of the squareStocks whipping posts and this the remains of thegallows Bad This is bad It brings on the flood of imagesthat torments me awake or asleep Peeta being tortureddrowned burned lacerated shocked maimed beatenasthe Capitol tries to get information about the rebellion thathe doesnt know I squeeze my eyes shut and try to reachfor him across the hundreds and hundreds of miles to sendmy thoughts into his mind to let him know he is not aloneBut he is And I cant help himRunning Away from the square and to the one placethe fire did not destroy I pass the wreckage of the mayorshouse where my friend Madge lived No word of her or herfamily Were they evacuated to the Capitol because of herfathers position or left to the flames Ashes billow uparound me and I pull the hem of my shirt up over my mouthIts not wondering what I breathe in but who that threatensto choke meThe grass has been scorched and the gray snow fellhere as well but the twelve fine houses of the VictorsVillage are unscathed I bolt into the house I lived in for thepast year slam the door closed and lean back against itThe place seems untouched Clean Eerily quiet Why did Icome back to  How can this visit help me answer thequestion I cant escapeWhat am I going to do I whisper to the wallsBecause I really dont knowPeople keep talking at me talking talking talkingPlutarch Heavensbee His calculating assistant FulviaCardew A mishmash of district leaders Military officialsBut not Alma Coin the president of  who just watchesShes fifty or so with gray hair that falls in an unbrokensheet to her shoulders Im somewhat fascinated by herhair since its so uniform so without a flaw a wisp even asplit end Her eyes are gray but not like those of peoplefrom the Seam Theyre very pale as if almost all the colorhas been sucked out of them The color of slush that youwish would melt awayWhat they want is for me to truly take on the role theydesigned for me The symbol of the revolution TheMockingjay It isnt enough what Ive done in the pastdefying the Capitol in the Games providing a rallying pointI must now become the actual leader the face the voicethe embodiment of the revolution The person who thedistrictsmost of which are now openly at war with theCapitolcan count on to blaze the path to victory I wonthave to do it alone They have a whole team of people tomake me over dress me write my speeches orchestratemy appearancesas if that doesnt sound horribly familiarand all I have to do is play my part Sometimes I listen tothem and sometimes I just watch the perfect line of Coinshair and try to decide if its a wig Eventually I leave theroom because my head starts to ache or its time to eat or ifI dont get aboveground I might start screaming I dontbother to say anything I simply get up and walk outYesterday afternoon as the door was closing behindme I heard Coin say I told you we should have rescuedthe boy first Meaning Peeta I couldnt agree more Hewouldve been an excellent mouthpieceAnd who did they fish out of the arena instead Mewho wont cooperate Beetee an older inventor from  whoI rarely see because he was pulled into weaponsdevelopment the minute he could sit upright Literally theywheeled his hospital bed into some top secret area andnow he only occasionally shows up for meals Hes verysmart and very willing to help the cause but not reallyfirebrand material Then theres Finnick Odair the sexsymbol from the fishing district who kept Peeta alive in thearena when I couldnt They want to transform Finnick into arebel leader as well but first theyll have to get him to stayawake for more than five minutes Even when he isconscious you have to say everything to him three times toget through to his brain The doctors say its from theelectrical shock he received in the arena but I know its alot more complicated than that I know that Finnick cantfocus on anything in  because hes trying so hard to seewhats happening in the Capitol to Annie the mad girl fromhis district whos the only person on earth he lovesDespite serious reservations I had to forgive Finnickfor his role in the conspiracy that landed me here He atleast has some idea of what Im going through And it takestoo much energy to stay angry with someone who cries somuchI move through the downstairs on hunters feetreluctant to make any sound I pick up a fewremembrances a photo of my parents on their weddingday a blue hair ribbon for Prim the family book ofmedicinal and edible plants The book falls open to a pagewith yellow flowers and I shut it quickly because it wasPeetas brush that painted themWhat am I going to doIs there any point in doing anything at all My mothermy sister and Gales family are finally safe As for the restof  people are either dead which is irreversible orprotected in  That leaves the rebels in the districts Ofcourse I hate the Capitol but I have no confidence that mybeing the Mockingjay will benefit those who are trying tobring it down How can I help the districts when every time Imake a move it results in suffering and loss of life The oldman shot in District  for whistling The crackdown in after I intervened in Gales whipping My stylist Cinnabeing dragged bloody and unconscious from the LaunchRoom before the Games Plutarchs sources believe hewas killed during interrogation Brilliant enigmatic lovelyCinna is dead because of me I push the thought awaybecause its too impossibly painful to dwell on withoutlosing my fragile hold on the situation entirelyWhat am I going to doTo become the Mockingjaycould any good I dopossibly outweigh the damage Who can I trust to answerthat question Certainly not that crew in  I swear nowthat my family and Gales are out of harms way I could runaway Except for one unfinished piece of business PeetaIf I knew for sure that he was dead I could just disappearinto the woods and never look back But until I do Im stuckI spin on my heel at the sound of a hiss In the kitchendoorway back arched ears flattened stands the ugliesttomcat in the world Buttercup I say Thousands of peopleare dead but he has survived and even looks well fed Onwhat He can get in and out of the house through a windowwe always left ajar in the pantry He must have been eatingfield mice I refuse to consider the alternativeI squat down and extend a hand Come here boyNot likely Hes angry at his abandonment Besides Im notoffering food and my ability to provide scraps has alwaysbeen my main redeeming quality to him For a while whenwe used to meet up at the old house because we bothdisliked this new one we seemed to be bonding a littleThats clearly over He blinks those unpleasant yellow eyesWant to see Prim I ask Her name catches hisattention Besides his own its the only word that meansanything to him He gives a rusty meow and approachesme I pick him up stroking his fur then go to the closet anddig out my game bag and unceremoniously stuff him inTheres no other way Ill be able to carry him on thehovercraft and he means the world to my sister Her goatLady an animal of actual value has unfortunately not madean appearanceIn my headset I hear Gales voice telling me we mustgo back But the game bag has reminded me of one morething that I want I sling the strap of the bag over the back ofa chair and dash up the steps to my bedroom Inside thecloset hangs my fathers hunting jacket Before the Quell Ibrought it here from the old house thinking its presencemight be of comfort to my mother and sister when I wasdead Thank goodness or itd be ash nowThe soft leather feels soothing and for a moment Imcalmed by the memories of the hours spent wrapped in itThen inexplicably my palms begin to sweat A strangesensation creeps up the back of my neck I whip around toface the room and find it empty Tidy Everything in itsplace There was no sound to alarm me What thenMy nose twitches Its the smell Cloying and artificial Adab of white peeks out of a vase of dried flowers on mydresser I approach it with cautious steps There all butobscured by its preserved cousins is a fresh white rosePerfect Down to the last thorn and silken petalAnd I know immediately whos sent it to mePresident SnowWhen I begin to gag at the stench I back away andclear out How long has it been here A day An hour Therebels did a security sweep of the Victors Village before Iwas cleared to come here checking for explosives bugsanything unusual But perhaps the rose didnt seemnoteworthy to them Only to meDownstairs I snag the game bag off the chairbouncing it along the floor until I remember its occupiedOn the lawn I frantically signal to the hovercraft whileButtercup thrashes I jab him with my elbow but this onlyinfuriates him A hovercraft materializes and a ladder dropsdown I step on and the current freezes me until Im lifted onboardGale helps me from the ladder You all rightYeah I say wiping the sweat off my face with mysleeveHe left me a rose I want to scream but its notinformation Im sure I should share with someone likePlutarch looking on First of all because it will make mesound crazy Like I either imagined it which is quitepossible or Im overreacting which will buy me a trip backto the druginduced dreamland Im trying so hard to escapeNo one will fully understandhow its not just a flower noteven just President Snows flower but a promise ofrevengebecause no one else sat in the study with himwhen he threatened me before the Victory TourPositioned on my dresser that whiteassnow rose isa personal message to me It speaks of unfinishedbusiness It whispers I can find you I can reach youPerhaps I am watching you nowAre there Capitol hoverplanes speeding in to blow usout of the sky As we travel over District  I watchanxiously for signs of an attack but nothing pursues usAfter several minutes when I hear an exchange betweenPlutarch and the pilot confirming that the airspace is clear Ibegin to relax a littleGale nods at the howls coming from my game bagNow I know why you had to go backIf there was even a chance of his recovery I dumpthe bag onto a seat where the loathsome creature beginsa low deepthroated growl Oh shut up I tell the bag as Isink into the cushioned window seat across from itGale sits next to me Pretty bad down thereCouldnt be much worse I answer I look in his eyesand see my own grief reflected there Our hands find eachother holding fast to a part of  that Snow has somehowfailed to destroy We sit in silence for the rest of the trip to which only takes about fortyfive minutes A mereweeks journey on foot Bonnie and Twill the District refugees who I encountered in the woods last winterwerent so far from their destination after all Theyapparently didnt make it though When I asked about themin  no one seemed to know who I was talking aboutDied in the woods I guessFrom the air  looks about as cheerful as  Therubble isnt smoking the way the Capitol shows it ontelevision but theres next to no life aboveground In theseventyfive years since the Dark Dayswhen  was saidto have been obliterated in the war between the Capitoland the districtsalmost all new construction has beenbeneath the earths surface There was already asubstantial underground facility here developed overcenturies to be either a clandestine refuge for governmentleaders in time of war or a last resort for humanity if lifeabove became unlivable Most important for the people of it was the center of the Capitols nuclear weaponsdevelopment program During the Dark Days the rebels in wrested control from the government forces trainedtheir nuclear missiles on the Capitol and then struck abargain They would play dead in exchange for being leftalone The Capitol had another nuclear arsenal out westbut it couldnt attack  without certain retaliation It wasforced to accept s deal The Capitol demolished thevisible remains of the district and cut off all access from theoutside Perhaps the Capitols leaders thought that withouthelp  would die off on its own It almost did a few timesbut it always managed to pull through due to strict sharingof resources strenuous discipline and constant vigilanceagainst any further attacks from the CapitolNow the citizens live almost exclusively undergroundYou can go outside for exercise and sunlight but only at veryspecific times in your schedule You cant miss yourschedule Every morning youre supposed to stick yourright arm in this contraption in the wall It tattoos the smoothinside of your forearm with your schedule for the day in asickly purple ink Breakfast Kitchen DutiesEducation Center Room  And so on The ink isindelible until Bathing Thats when whatever keepsit water resistant breaks down and the whole schedulerinses away The lightsout at  signals that everyonenot on the night shift should be in bedAt first when I was so ill in the hospital I could forgobeing imprinted But once I moved into Compartment with my mother and sister I was expected to get with theprogram Except for showing up for meals though I prettymuch ignore the words on my arm I just go back to ourcompartment or wander around  or fall asleepsomewhere hidden An abandoned air duct Behind thewater pipes in the laundry Theres a closet in the EducationCenter thats great because no one ever seems to needschool supplies Theyre so frugal with things here waste ispractically a criminal activity Fortunately the people of have never been wasteful But once I saw Fulvia Cardewcrumple up a sheet of paper with just a couple of wordswritten on it and you wouldve thought shed murderedsomeone from the looks she got Her face turned tomatored making the silver flowers inlaid in her plump cheekseven more noticeable The very portrait of excess One ofmy few pleasures in  is watching the handful ofpampered Capitol rebels squirming as they try to fit inI dont know how long Ill be able to get away with mycomplete disregard for the clockwork precision ofattendance required by my hosts Right now they leave mealone because Im classified as mentally disorienteditsays so right on my plastic medical braceletand everyonehas to tolerate my ramblings But that cant last foreverNeither can their patience with the Mockingjay issueFrom the landing pad Gale and I walk down a seriesof stairways to Compartment  We could take theelevator only it reminds me too much of the one that liftedme into the arena Im having a hard time adjusting to beingunderground so much But after the surreal encounter withthe rose for the first time the descent makes me feel saferI hesitate at the door marked  anticipating thequestions from my family What am I going to tell themabout Twelve I ask GaleI doubt theyll ask for details They saw it burn Theyllmostly be worried about how youre handling it Galetouches my cheek Like I amI press my face against his hand for a moment IllsurviveThen I take a deep breath and open the door Mymother and sister are home for Reflection a halfhour of downtime before dinner I see the concern on theirfaces as they try to gauge my emotional state Beforeanyone can ask anything I empty my game bag and itbecomes Cat Adoration Prim just sits on the floorweeping and rocking that awful Buttercup who interruptshis purring only for an occasional hiss at me He gives me aparticularly smug look when she ties the blue ribbon aroundhis neckMy mother hugs the wedding photo tightly against herchest and then places it along with the book of plants onour governmentissued chest of drawers I hang my fathersjacket on the back of a chair For a moment the placealmost seems like home So I guess the trip to  wasnt acomplete wasteWere heading down to the dining hall for Dinner when Gales communicuff begins to beep It lookslike an oversized watch but it receives print messagesBeing granted a communicuff is a special privilege thatsreserved for those important to the cause a status Galeachieved by his rescue of the citizens of  They need thetwo of us in Command he saysTrailing a few steps behind Gale I try to collect myselfbefore Im thrown into whats sure to be another relentlessMockingjay session I linger in the doorway of Commandthe hightech meetingwar council room complete withcomputerized talking walls electronic maps showing thetroop movements in various districts and a giantrectangular table with control panels Im not supposed totouch No one notices me though because theyre allgathered at a television screen at the far end of the roomthat airs the Capitol broadcast around the clock Imthinking I might be able to slip away when Plutarch whoseample frame has been blocking the television catchessight of me and waves urgently for me to join them Ireluctantly move forward trying to imagine how it could beof interest to me Its always the same War footagePropaganda Replaying the bombings of District  Anominous message from President Snow So its almostentertaining to see Caesar Flickerman the eternal host ofthe Hunger Games with his painted face and sparkly suitpreparing to give an interview Until the camera pulls backand I see that his guest is PeetaA sound escapes me The same combination of gaspand groan that comes from being submerged in waterdeprived of oxygen to the point of pain I push people asideuntil I am right in front of him my hand resting on the screenI search his eyes for any sign of hurt any reflection of theagony of torture There is nothing Peeta looks healthy tothe point of robustness His skin is glowing flawless in thatfullbodypolish way His manners composed serious Icant reconcile this image with the battered bleeding boywho haunts my dreamsCaesar settles himself more comfortably in the chairacross from Peeta and gives him a long lookSoPeetawelcome backPeeta smiles slightly I bet you thought youd doneyour last interview with me CaesarI confess I did says Caesar The night before theQuarter Quellwell who ever thought wed see you againIt wasnt part of my plan thats for sure says Peetawith a frownCaesar leans in to him a little I think it was clear to allof us what your plan was To sacrifice yourself in the arenaso that Katniss Everdeen and your child could surviveThat was it Clear and simple Peetas fingers tracethe upholstered pattern on the arm of the chair But otherpeople had plans as wellYes other people had plans I think Has Peetaguessed then how the rebels used us as pawns How myrescue was arranged from the beginning And finally howour mentor Haymitch Abernathy betrayed us both for acause he pretended to have no interest inIn the silence that follows I notice the lines that haveformed between Peetas eyebrows He has guessed or hehas been told But the Capitol has not killed or evenpunished him For right now that exceeds my wildesthopes I drink in his wholeness the soundness of his bodyand mind It runs through me like the morphling they giveme in the hospital dulling the pain of the last weeksWhy dont you tell us about that last night in thearena suggests Caesar Help us sort a few things outPeeta nods but takes his time speaking That lastnightto tell you about that last nightwell first of all youhave to imagine how it felt in the arena It was like being aninsect trapped under a bowl filled with steaming air And allaround you junglegreen and alive and ticking That giantclock ticking away your life Every hour promising somenew horror You have to imagine that in the past two dayssixteen people have diedsome of them defending you Atthe rate things are going the last eight will be dead bymorning Save one The victor And your plan is that it wontbe youMy body breaks out in a sweat at the memory Myhand slides down the screen and hangs limply at my sidePeeta doesnt need a brush to paint images from theGames He works just as well in wordsOnce youre in the arena the rest of the worldbecomes very distant he continues All the people andthings you loved or cared about almost cease to exist Thepink sky and the monsters in the jungle and the tributes whowant your blood become your final reality the only one thatever mattered As bad as it makes you feel youre going tohave to do some killing because in the arena you only getone wish And its very costlyIt costs your life says CaesarOh no It costs a lot more than your life To murderinnocent people says Peeta It costs everything you areEverything you are repeats Caesar quietlyA hush has fallen over the room and I can feel itspreading across Panem A nation leaning in toward itsscreens Because no one has ever talked about what itsreally like in the arena beforePeeta goes on So you hold on to your wish And thatlast night yes my wish was to save Katniss But evenwithout knowing about the rebels it didnt feel rightEverything was too complicated I found myself regretting Ihadnt run off with her earlier in the day as she hadsuggested But there was no getting out of it at that pointYou were too caught up in Beetees plan to electrifythe salt lake says CaesarToo busy playing allies with the others I should havenever let them separate us Peeta bursts out Thats whenI lost herWhen you stayed at the lightning tree and she andJohanna Mason took the coil of wire down to the waterCaesar clarifiesI didnt want to Peeta flushes in agitation But Icouldnt argue with Beetee without indicating we wereabout to break away from the alliance When that wire wascut everything just went insane I can only remember bitsand pieces Trying to find her Watching Brutus kill ChaffKilling Brutus myself I know she was calling my name Thenthe lightning bolt hit the tree and the force field around thearenablew outKatniss blew it out Peeta says Caesar Youveseen the footageShe didnt know what she was doing None of uscould follow Beetees plan You can see her trying to figureout what to do with that wire Peeta snaps backAll right It just looks suspicious says Caesar As ifshe was part of the rebels plan all alongPeetas on his feet leaning in to Caesars face handslocked on the arms of his interviewers chair Really Andwas it part of her plan for Johanna to nearly kill her For thatelectric shock to paralyze her To trigger the bombingHes yelling now She didnt know Caesar Neither of usknew anything except that we were trying to keep eachother aliveCaesar places his hand on Peetas chest in a gesturethats both selfprotective and conciliatory Okay Peeta Ibelieve youOkay Peeta withdraws from Caesar pulling back hishands running them through his hair mussing his carefullystyled blond curls He slumps back in his chair distraughtCaesar waits a moment studying Peeta What aboutyour mentor Haymitch AbernathyPeetas face hardens I dont know what HaymitchknewCould he have been part of the conspiracy asksCaesarHe never mentioned it says PeetaCaesar presses on What does your heart tell youThat I shouldnt have trusted him says Peeta ThatsallI havent seen Haymitch since I attacked him on thehovercraft leaving long claw marks down his face I knowits been bad for him here District  strictly forbids anyproduction or consumption of intoxicating beverages andeven the rubbing alcohol in the hospital is kept under lockand key Finally Haymitch is being forced into sobriety withno secret stashes or homebrewed concoctions to ease histransition Theyve got him in seclusion until hes dried outas hes not deemed fit for public display It must beexcruciating but I lost all my sympathy for Haymitch when Irealized how he had deceived us I hope hes watching theCapitol broadcast now so he can see that Peeta has casthim off as wellCaesar pats Peetas shoulder We can stop now ifyou wantWas there more to discuss says Peeta wrylyI was going to ask your thoughts on the war but ifyoure too upset begins CaesarOh Im not too upset to answer that Peeta takes adeep breath and then looks straight into the camera I wanteveryone watchingwhether youre on the Capitol or therebel sideto stop for just a moment and think about whatthis war could mean For human beings We almost wentextinct fighting one another before Now our numbers areeven fewer Our conditions more tenuous Is this really whatwe want to do Kill ourselves off completely In the hopesthatwhat Some decent species will inherit the smokingremains of the earthI dont reallyIm not sure Im following saysCaesarWe cant fight one another Caesar Peeta explainsThere wont be enough of us left to keep going Ifeverybody doesnt lay down their weaponsand I mean asin very soonits all over anywaySoyoure calling for a ceasefire Caesar asksYes Im calling for a ceasefire says Peeta tiredlyNow why dont we ask the guards to take me back to myquarters so I can build another hundred card housesCaesar turns to the camera All right I think that wrapsit up So back to our regularly scheduled programmingMusic plays them out and then theres a womanreading a list of expected shortages in the Capitolfreshfruit solar batteries soap I watch her with uncharacteristicabsorption because I know everyone will be waiting for myreaction to the interview But theres no way I can process itall so quicklythe joy of seeing Peeta alive and unharmedhis defense of my innocence in collaborating with therebels and his undeniable complicity with the Capitol nowthat hes called for a ceasefire Oh he made it sound as ifhe were condemning both sides in the war But at this pointwith only minor victories for the rebels a ceasefire couldonly result in a return to our previous status Or worseBehind me I can hear the accusations against Peetabuilding The words traitor liar and enemy bounce off thewalls Since I can neither join in the rebels outrage norcounter it I decide the best thing to do is clear out As Ireach the door Coins voice rises above the others Youhave not been dismissed Soldier EverdeenOne of Coins men lays a hand on my arm Its not anaggressive move really but after the arena I reactdefensively to any unfamiliar touch I jerk my arm free andtake off running down the halls Behind me theres thesound of a scuffle but I dont stop My mind does a quickinventory of my odd little hiding places and I wind up in thesupply closet curled up against a crate of chalkYoure alive I whisper pressing my palms againstmy cheeks feeling the smile thats so wide it must look likea grimace Peetas alive And a traitor But at the moment Idont care Not what he says or who he says it for only thathe is still capable of speechAfter a while the door opens and someone slips inGale slides down beside me his nose trickling bloodWhat happened I askI got in Boggss way he answers with a shrug I usemy sleeve to wipe his nose Watch itI try to be gentler Patting not wiping Which one isheOh you know Coins righthand lackey The one whotried to stop you He pushes my hand away Quit Youllbleed me to deathThe trickle has turned to a steady stream I give up onthe firstaid attempts You fought with BoggsNo just blocked the doorway when he tried to followyou His elbow caught me in the nose says GaleTheyll probably punish you I sayAlready have He holds up his wrist I stare at ituncomprehendingly Coin took back my communicuffI bite my lip trying to remain serious But it seems soridiculous Im sorry Soldier Gale HawthorneDont be Soldier Katniss Everdeen He grins I feltlike a jerk walking around with it anyway We both startlaughing I think it was quite a demotionThis is one of the few good things about  GettingGale back With the pressure of the Capitols arrangedmarriage between Peeta and me gone weve managed toregain our friendship He doesnt push it any furthertry tokiss me or talk about love Either Ive been too sick or heswilling to give me space or he knows its just too cruel withPeeta in the hands of the Capitol Whatever the case Ivegot someone to tell my secrets to againWho are these people I sayTheyre us If wed had nukes instead of a few lumpsof coal he answersI like to think Twelve wouldnt have abandoned the restof the rebels back in the Dark Days I sayWe might have If it was that surrender or start anuclear war says Gale In a way its remarkable theysurvived at allMaybe its because I still have the ashes of my owndistrict on my shoes but for the first time I give the peopleof  something I have withheld from them credit Forstaying alive against all odds Their early years must havebeen terrible huddled in the chambers beneath the groundafter their city was bombed to dust Population decimatedno possible ally to turn to for aid Over the past seventyfiveyears theyve learned to be selfsufficient turned theircitizens into an army and built a new society with no helpfrom anyone They would be even more powerful if that poxepidemic hadnt flattened their birthrate and made them sodesperate for a new gene pool and breeders Maybe theyare militaristic overly programmed and somewhat lackingin a sense of humor Theyre here And willing to take on theCapitolStill it took them long enough to show up I sayIt wasnt simple They had to build up a rebel base inthe Capitol get some sort of underground organized in thedistricts he says Then they needed someone to set thewhole thing in motion They needed youThey needed Peeta too but they seem to haveforgotten that I sayGales expression darkens Peeta might have done alot of damage tonight Most of the rebels will dismiss whathe said immediately of course But there are districtswhere the resistance is shakier The ceasefires clearlyPresident Snows idea But it seems so reasonable comingout of Peetas mouthIm afraid of Gales answer but I ask anyway Why doyou think he said itHe might have been tortured Or persuaded Myguess is he made some kind of deal to protect you Hedput forth the idea of the ceasefire if Snow let him presentyou as a confused pregnant girl who had no idea what wasgoing on when she was taken prisoner by the rebels Thisway if the districts lose theres still a chance of leniency foryou If you play it right I must still look perplexed becauseGale delivers the next line very slowly Katnisshes stilltrying to keep you aliveTo keep me alive And then I understand The Gamesare still on We have left the arena but since Peeta and Iwerent killed his last wish to preserve my life still standsHis idea is to have me lie low remain safe and imprisonedwhile the war plays out Then neither side will really havecause to kill me And Peeta If the rebels win it will bedisastrous for him If the Capitol wins who knows Maybewell both be allowed to liveif I play it rightto watch theGames go onImages flash through my mind the spear piercingRues body in the arena Gale hanging senseless from thewhipping post the corpselittered wasteland of my homeAnd for what For what As my blood turns hot I rememberother things My first glimpse of an uprising in District The victors locked hand in hand the night before theQuarter Quell And how it was no accident my shooting thatarrow into the force field in the arena How badly I wanted itto lodge deep in the heart of my enemyI spring up upsetting a box of a hundred pencilssending them scattering around the floorWhat is it Gale asksThere cant be a ceasefire I lean down fumbling as Ishove the sticks of dark gray graphite back into the boxWe cant go backI know Gale sweeps up a handful of pencils and tapsthem on the floor into perfect alignmentWhatever reason Peeta had for saying those thingshes wrong The stupid sticks wont go in the box and Isnap several in my frustrationI know Give it here Youre breaking them to bits Hepulls the box from my hands and refills it with swift concisemotionsHe doesnt know what they did to Twelve If hecouldve seen what was on the ground I startKatniss Im not arguing If I could hit a button and killevery living soul working for the Capitol I would do itWithout hesitation He slides the last pencil into the boxand flips the lid closed The question is what are yougoing to doIt turns out the question thats been eating away at mehas only ever had one possible answer But it took Peetasploy for me to recognize itWhat am I going to doI take a deep breath My arms rise slightlyas ifrecalling the blackandwhite wings Cinna gave methencome to rest at my sidesIm going to be the MockingjayButtercups eyes reflect the faint glow of the safety lightover the door as he lies in the crook of Prims arm back onthe job protecting her from the night Shes snuggled closeto my mother Asleep they look just as they did the morningof the reaping that landed me in my first Games I have abed to myself because Im recuperating and because noone can sleep with me anyway what with the nightmaresand the thrashing aroundAfter tossing and turning for hours I finally accept that itwill be a wakeful night Under Buttercups watchful eye Itiptoe across the cold tiled floor to the dresserThe middle drawer contains my governmentissuedclothes Everyone wears the same gray pants and shirt theshirt tucked in at the waist Underneath the clothes I keepthe few items I had on me when I was lifted from the arenaMy mockingjay pin Peetas token the gold locket withphotos of my mother and Prim and Gale inside A silverparachute that holds a spile for tapping trees and the pearlPeeta gave me a few hours before I blew out the force fieldDistrict  confiscated my tube of skin ointment for use inthe hospital and my bow and arrows because only guardshave clearance to carry weapons Theyre in safekeeping inthe armoryI feel around for the parachute and slide my fingersinside until they close around the pearl I sit back on my bedcrosslegged and find myself rubbing the smooth iridescentsurface of the pearl back and forth against my lips Forsome reason its soothing A cool kiss from the giverhimselfKatniss Prim whispers Shes awake peering atme through the darkness Whats wrongNothing Just a bad dream Go back to sleep Itsautomatic Shutting Prim and my mother out of things toshield themCareful not to rouse my mother Prim eases herselffrom the bed scoops up Buttercup and sits beside meShe touches the hand that has curled around the pearlYoure cold Taking a spare blanket from the foot of thebed she wraps it around all three of us enveloping me inher warmth and Buttercups furry heat as well You couldtell me you know Im good at keeping secrets Even fromMotherShes really gone then The little girl with the back ofher shirt sticking out like a duck tail the one who neededhelp reaching the dishes and who begged to see thefrosted cakes in the bakery window Time and tragedy haveforced her to grow too quickly at least for my taste into ayoung woman who stitches bleeding wounds and knowsour mother can hear only so muchTomorrow morning Im going to agree to be theMockingjay I tell herBecause you want to or because you feel forced intoit she asksI laugh a little Both I guess No I want to I have to if itwill help the rebels defeat Snow I squeeze the pearl moretightly in my fist Its justPeeta Im afraid if we do win therebels will execute him as a traitorPrim thinks this over Katniss I dont think youunderstand how important you are to the cause Importantpeople usually get what they want If you want to keepPeeta safe from the rebels you canI guess Im important They went to a lot of trouble torescue me They took me to  You meanI coulddemand that they give Peeta immunity And theyd have toagree to itI think you could demand almost anything and theydhave to agree to it Prim wrinkles her brow Only how doyou know theyll keep their wordI remember all of the lies Haymitch told Peeta and meto get us to do what he wanted Whats to keep the rebelsfrom reneging on the deal A verbal promise behind closeddoors even a statement written on paperthese couldeasily evaporate after the war Their existence or validitydenied Any witnesses in Command will be worthless Infact theyd probably be the ones writing out Peetas deathwarrant Ill need a much larger pool of witnesses Ill needeveryone I can getIt will have to be public I say Buttercup gives a flickof his tail that I take as agreement Ill make Coin announceit in front of the entire population of ThirteenPrim smiles Oh thats good Its not a guarantee butit will be much harder for them to back out of their promiseI feel the kind of relief that follows an actual solution Ishould wake you up more often little duckI wish you would says Prim She gives me a kissTry and sleep now all right And I doIn the morning I see that Breakfast is directlyfollowed by Command which is fine since I may aswell start the ball rolling At the dining hall I flash myschedule which includes some kind of ID number in frontof a sensor As I slide my tray along the metal shelf beforethe vats of food I see breakfast is its usual dependableselfa bowl of hot grain a cup of milk and a small scoop offruit or vegetables Today mashed turnips All of it comesfrom s underground farms I sit at the table assigned tothe Everdeens and the Hawthornes and some otherrefugees and shovel my food down wishing for secondsbut there are never seconds here They have nutrition downto a science You leave with enough calories to take you tothe next meal no more no less Serving size is based onyour age height body type health and amount of physicallabor required by your schedule The people from  arealready getting slightly larger portions than the natives of in an effort to bring us up to weight I guess bony soldierstire too quickly Its working though In just a month werestarting to look healthier particularly the kidsGale sets his tray beside me and I try not to stare at histurnips too pathetically because I really want more andhes already too quick to slip me his food Even though Iturn my attention to neatly folding my napkin a spoonful ofturnips slops into my bowlYouve got to stop that I say But since Im alreadyscooping up the stuff its not too convincing Really Itsprobably illegal or something They have very strict rulesabout food For instance if you dont finish something andwant to save it for later you cant take it from the dining hallApparently in the early days there was some incident offood hoarding For a couple of people like Gale and mewhove been in charge of our families food supply foryears it doesnt sit well We know how to be hungry but nothow to be told how to handle what provisions we have Insome ways District  is even more controlling than theCapitolWhat can they do Theyve already got mycommunicuff says GaleAs I scrape my bowl clean I have an inspiration Heymaybe I should make that a condition of being theMockingjayThat I can feed you turnips he saysNo that we can hunt That gets his attention Wedhave to give everything to the kitchen But still we could Idont have to finish because he knows We could beaboveground Out in the woods We could be ourselvesagainDo it he says Nows the time You could ask for themoon and theyd have to find some way to get itHe doesnt know that Im already asking for the moonby demanding they spare Peetas life Before I can decidewhether or not to tell him a bell signals the end of oureating shift The thought of facing Coin alone makes menervous What are you scheduled forGale checks his arm Nuclear History class Whereby the way your absence has been notedI have to go to Command Come with me I askAll right But they might throw me out after yesterdayAs we go to drop off our trays he says You know youbetter put Buttercup on your list of demands too I dontthink the concept of useless pets is well known hereOh theyll find him a job Tattoo it on his paw everymorning I say But I make a mental note to include him forPrims sakeBy the time we get to Command Coin Plutarch andall their people have already assembled The sight of Galeraises some eyebrows but no one throws him out Mymental notes have become too jumbled so I ask for apiece of paper and a pencil right off My apparent interestin the proceedingsthe first Ive shown since Ive been heretakes them by surprise Several looks are exchangedProbably they had some extraspecial lecture planned forme But instead Coin personally hands me the suppliesand everyone waits in silence while I sit at the table andscrawl out my list Buttercup Hunting Peetas immunityAnnounced in publicThis is it Probably my only chance to bargain ThinkWhat else do you want I feel him standing at my shoulderGale I add to the list I dont think I can do this without himThe headaches coming on and my thoughts begin totangle I shut my eyes and start to recite silentlyMy name is Katniss Everdeen I am seventeen yearsold My home is District  I was in the Hunger Games Iescaped The Capitol hates me Peeta was takenprisoner He is alive He is a traitor but alive I have tokeep him aliveThe list It still seems too small I should try to thinkbigger beyond our current situation where I am of theutmost importance to the future where I may be worthnothing Shouldnt I be asking for more For my family Forthe remainder of my people My skin itches with the ashesof the dead I feel the sickening impact of the skull againstmy shoe The scent of blood and roses stings my noseThe pencil moves across the page on its own I openmy eyes and see the wobbly letters I KILL SNOW If hescaptured I want the privilegePlutarch gives a discreet cough About done there Iglance up and notice the clock Ive been sitting here fortwenty minutes Finnick isnt the only one with attentionproblemsYeah I say My voice sounds hoarse so I clear mythroat Yeah so this is the deal Ill be your MockingjayI wait so they can make their sounds of reliefcongratulate slap one another on the back Coin stays asimpassive as ever watching me unimpressedBut I have some conditions I smooth out the list andbegin My family gets to keep our cat My tiniest requestsets off an argument The Capitol rebels see this as anonissueof course I can keep my petwhile those from spell out what extreme difficulties this presents Finallyits worked out that well be moved to the top level whichhas the luxury of an eightinch window abovegroundButtercup may come and go to do his business He will beexpected to feed himself If he misses curfew he will belocked out If he causes any security problems hell be shotimmediatelyThat sounds okay Not so different from how hes beenliving since we left Except for the shooting part If he lookstoo thin I can slip him a few entrails provided my nextrequest is allowedI want to hunt With Gale Out in the woods I say Thisgives everyone pauseWe wont go far Well use our own bows You canhave the meat for the kitchen adds GaleI hurry on before they can say no Its justI cantbreathe shut up here like aI would get better faster ifIcould huntPlutarch begins to explain the drawbacks herethedangers the extra security the risk of injurybut Coin cutshim off No Let them Give them two hours a daydeducted from their training time A quartermile radiusWith communication units and tracker anklets WhatsnextI skim my list Gale Ill need him with me to do thisWith you how Off camera By your side at all timesDo you want him presented as your new lover Coin asksShe hasnt said this with any particular malicequitethe contrary her words are very matteroffact But mymouth still drops open in shock WhatI think we should continue the current romance Aquick defection from Peeta could cause the audience tolose sympathy for her says Plutarch Especially sincethey think shes pregnant with his childAgreed So onscreen Gale can simply be portrayedas a fellow rebel Is that all right says Coin I just stare ather She repeats herself impatiently For Gale Will that besufficientWe can always work him in as your cousin saysFulviaWere not cousins Gale and I say togetherRight but we should probably keep that up forappearances sake on camera says Plutarch Offcamera hes all yours Anything elseIm rattled by the turn in the conversation Theimplications that I could so readily dispose of Peeta thatIm in love with Gale that the whole thing has been an actMy cheeks begin to burn The very notion that Im devotingany thought to who I want presented as my lover given ourcurrent circumstances is demeaning I let my anger propelme into my greatest demand When the war is over ifweve won Peeta will be pardonedDead silence I feel Gales body tense I guess I shouldhave told him before but I wasnt sure how hed respondNot when it involved PeetaNo form of punishment will be inflicted I continue Anew thought occurs to me The same goes for the othercaptured tributes Johanna and Enobaria Frankly I dontcare about Enobaria the vicious District  tribute In fact Idislike her but it seems wrong to leave her outNo says Coin flatlyYes I shoot back Its not their fault you abandonedthem in the arena Who knows what the Capitols doing tothemTheyll be tried with other war criminals and treated asthe tribunal sees fit she saysTheyll be granted immunity I feel myself rising frommy chair my voice full and resonant You will personallypledge this in front of the entire population of DistrictThirteen and the remainder of Twelve Soon Today It willbe recorded for future generations You will hold yourselfand your government responsible for their safety or youllfind yourself another MockingjayMy words hang in the air for a long momentThats her I hear Fulvia hiss to Plutarch Right thereWith the costume gunfire in the background just a hint ofsmokeYes thats what we want says Plutarch under hisbreathI want to glare at them but I feel it would be a mistaketo turn my attention from Coin I can see her tallying the costof my ultimatum weighing it against my possible worthWhat do you say President asks Plutarch Youcould issue an official pardon given the circumstancesThe boyhes not even of ageAll right Coin says finally But youd better performIll perform when youve made the announcement IsayCall a national security assembly during Reflectiontoday she orders Ill make the announcement then Isthere anything left on your list KatnissMy papers crumpled into a ball in my right fist I flattenthe sheet against the table and read the rickety lettersJust one more thing I kill SnowFor the first time ever I see the hint of a smile on thepresidents lips When the time comes Ill flip you for itMaybe shes right I certainly dont have the sole claimagainst Snows life And I think I can count on her getting thejob done Fair enoughCoins eyes have flickered to her arm the clock Shetoo has a schedule to adhere to Ill leave her in yourhands then Plutarch She exits the room followed by herteam leaving only Plutarch Fulvia Gale and myselfExcellent Excellent Plutarch sinks down elbows onthe table rubbing his eyes You know what I miss Morethan anything Coffee I ask you would it be so unthinkableto have something to wash down the gruel and turnipsWe didnt think it would be quite so rigid here Fulviaexplains to us as she massages Plutarchs shoulders Notin the higher ranksOr at least thered be the option of a little side actionsays Plutarch I mean even Twelve had a black marketrightYeah the Hob says Gale Its where we tradedThere you see And look how moral you two areVirtually incorruptible Plutarch sighs Oh well wars dontlast forever So glad to have you on the team He reachesa hand out to the side where Fulvia is already extending alarge sketchbook bound in black leather You know ingeneral what were asking of you Katniss Im aware youhave mixed feelings about participating I hope this willhelpPlutarch slides the sketchbook across to me For amoment I look at it suspiciously Then curiosity gets thebetter of me I open the cover to find a picture of myselfstanding straight and strong in a black uniform Only oneperson could have designed the outfit at first glance utterlyutilitarian at second a work of art The swoop of the helmetthe curve to the breastplate the slight fullness of thesleeves that allows the white folds under the arms to showIn his hands I am again a mockingjayCinna I whisperYes He made me promise not to show you this bookuntil youd decided to be the Mockingjay on your ownBelieve me I was very tempted says Plutarch Go onFlip throughI turn the pages slowly seeing each detail of theuniform The carefully tailored layers of body armor thehidden weapons in the boots and belt the specialreinforcements over my heart On the final page under asketch of my mockingjay pin Cinnas written Im stillbetting on youWhen did he My voice fails meLets see Well after the Quarter Quell announcementA few weeks before the Games maybe There are not onlythe sketches We have your uniforms Oh and Beetees gotsomething really special waiting for you down in the armoryI wont spoil it by hinting says PlutarchYoure going to be the bestdressed rebel in historysays Gale with a smile Suddenly I realize hes beenholding out on me Like Cinna hes wanted me to makethis decision all alongOur plan is to launch an Airtime Assault saysPlutarch To make a series of what we call proposwhichis short for propaganda spotsfeaturing you andbroadcast them to the entire population of PanemHow The Capitol has sole control of the broadcastssays GaleBut we have Beetee About ten years ago heessentially redesigned the underground network thattransmits all the programming He thinks theres areasonable chance it can be done Of course well needsomething to air So Katniss the studio awaits yourpleasure Plutarch turns to his assistant FulviaPlutarch and I have been talking about how on earthwe can pull this off We think that it might be best to buildyou our rebel leader from the outsidein That is to saylets find the most stunning Mockingjay look possible andthen work your personality up to deserving it she saysbrightlyYou already have her uniform says GaleYes but is she scarred and bloody Is she glowingwith the fire of rebellion Just how grimy can we make herwithout disgusting people At any rate she has to besomething I mean obviously thisFulvia moves in on mequickly framing my face with her handswont cut it I jerkmy head back reflexively but shes already busy gatheringher things So with that in mind we have another littlesurprise for you Come comeFulvia gives us a wave and Gale and I follow her andPlutarch out into the hallSo well intended and yet so insulting Gale whispersin my earWelcome to the Capitol I mouth back But Fulviaswords have no effect on me I wrap my arms tightly aroundthe sketchbook and allow myself to feel hopeful This mustbe the right decision If Cinna wanted itWe board an elevator and Plutarch checks his notesLets see Its Compartment ThreeNineOhEight Hepresses a button marked  but nothing happensYou must have to key it says FulviaPlutarch pulls a key attached to a thin chain from underhis shirt and inserts it into a slot I hadnt noticed before Thedoors slide shut Ah there we areThe elevator descends ten twenty thirtyplus levelsfarther down than I even knew District  went It opens ona wide white corridor lined with red doors which lookalmost decorative compared to the gray ones on the upperfloors Each is plainly marked with a number  As we step out I glance behind me to watch theelevator close and see a metallic grate slide into place overthe regular doors When I turn a guard has materializedfrom one of the rooms at the far end of the corridor A doorswings silently shut behind him as he strides toward usPlutarch moves to meet him raising a hand ingreeting and the rest of us follow behind him Somethingfeels very wrong down here Its more than the reinforcedelevator or the claustrophobia of being so far undergroundor the caustic smell of antiseptic One look at Gales faceand I can tell he senses it as wellGood morning we were just looking for PlutarchbeginsYou have the wrong floor says the guard abruptlyReally Plutarch doublechecks his notes Ive gotThreeNineOhEight written right here I wonder if you couldjust give a call up toIm afraid I have to ask you to leave now Assignmentdiscrepancies can be addressed at the Head Office saysthe guardIts right ahead of us Compartment  Just a fewsteps away The doorin fact all the doorsseemincomplete No knobs They must swing free on hinges likethe one the guard appeared throughWhere is that again asks FulviaYoull find the Head Office on Level Seven says theguard extending his arms to corral us back to the elevatorFrom behind door  comes a sound Just a tinywhimper Like something a cowed dog might make toavoid being struck only all too human and familiar My eyesmeet Gales for just a moment but its long enough for twopeople who operate the way we do I let Cinnassketchbook fall at the guards feet with a loud bang Asecond after he leans down to retrieve it Gale leans downtoo intentionally bumping heads Oh Im sorry he sayswith a light laugh catching the guards arms as if to steadyhimself turning him slightly away from meThats my chance I dart around the distracted guardpush open the door marked  and find them Halfnakedbruised and shackled to the wallMy prep teamThe stink of unwashed bodies stale urine andinfection breaks through the cloud of antiseptic The threefigures are only just recognizable by their most strikingfashion choices Venias gold facial tattoos Flaviussorange corkscrew curls Octavias light evergreen skinwhich now hangs too loosely as if her body were a slowlydeflating balloonOn seeing me Flavius and Octavia shrink backagainst the tiled walls like theyre anticipating an attackeven though I have never hurt them Unkind thoughts weremy worst offense against them and those I kept to myselfso why do they recoilThe guards ordering me out but by the shuffling thatfollows I know Gale has somehow detained him Foranswers I cross to Venia who was always the strongest Icrouch down and take her icy hands which clutch mine likevisesWhat happened Venia I ask What are you doinghereThey took us From the Capitol she says hoarselyPlutarch enters behind me What on earth is goingonWho took you I press herPeople she says vaguely The night you broke outWe thought it might be comforting for you to have yourregular team Plutarch says behind me Cinna requesteditCinna requested this I snarl at him Because iftheres one thing I know its that Cinna would never haveapproved the abuse of these three who he managed withgentleness and patience Why are they being treated likecriminalsI honestly dont know Theres something in his voicethat makes me believe him and the pallor on Fulvias faceconfirms it Plutarch turns to the guard whos just appearedin the doorway with Gale right behind him I was only toldthey were being confined Why are they being punishedFor stealing food We had to restrain them after analtercation over some bread says the guardVenias brows come together as if shes still trying tomake sense of it No one would tell us anything We wereso hungry It was just one slice she tookOctavia begins to sob muffling the sound in herragged tunic I think of how the first time I survived thearena Octavia sneaked me a roll under the table becauseshe couldnt bear my hunger I crawl across to her shakingform Octavia I touch her and she flinches Octavia Itsgoing to be all right Ill get you out of here okayThis seems extreme says PlutarchIts because they took a slice of bread asks GaleThere were repeated infractions leading up to thatThey were warned Still they took more bread The guardpauses a moment as if puzzled by our density You canttake breadI cant get Octavia to uncover her face but she lifts itslightly The shackles on her wrists shift down a few inchesrevealing raw sores beneath them Im bringing you to mymother I address the guard Unchain themThe guard shakes his head Its not authorizedUnchain them Now I yellThis breaks his composure Average citizens dontaddress him this way I have no release orders And youhave no authority toDo it on my authority says Plutarch We came tocollect these three anyway Theyre needed for SpecialDefense Ill take full responsibilityThe guard leaves to make a call He returns with a setof keys The preps have been forced into cramped bodypositions for so long that even once the shackles areremoved they have trouble walking Gale Plutarch and Ihave to help them Flaviuss foot catches on a metal grateover a circular opening in the floor and my stomachcontracts when I think of why a room would need a drainThe stains of human misery that must have been hosed offthese white tilesIn the hospital I find my mother the only one I trust tocare for them It takes her a minute to place the three giventheir current condition but already she wears a look ofconsternation And I know its not a result of seeing abusedbodies because they were her daily fare in District  butthe realization that this sort of thing goes on in  as wellMy mother was welcomed into the hospital but shesviewed as more of a nurse than a doctor despite herlifetime of healing Still no one interferes when she guidesthe trio into an examination room to assess their injuries Iplant myself on a bench in the hall outside the hospitalentrance waiting to hear her verdict She will be able toread in their bodies the pain inflicted upon themGale sits next to me and puts an arm around myshoulder Shell fix them up I give a nod wondering if hesthinking about his own brutal flogging back in Plutarch and Fulvia take the bench across from us butdont offer any comments on the state of my prep team Ifthey had no knowledge of the mistreatment then what dothey make of this move on President Coins part I decideto help them outI guess weve all been put on notice I sayWhat No What do you mean asks FulviaPunishing my prep teams a warning I tell her Notjust to me But to you too About whos really in control andwhat happens if shes not obeyed If you had any delusionsabout having power Id let them go now Apparently aCapitol pedigree is no protection here Maybe its even aliabilityThere is no comparison between Plutarch whomasterminded the rebel breakout and those threebeauticians says Fulvia icilyI shrug If you say so Fulvia But what would happen ifyou got on Coins bad side My prep team was kidnappedThey can at least hope to one day return to the CapitolGale and I can live in the woods But you Where would youtwo runPerhaps were a little more necessary to the war effortthan you give us credit for says Plutarch unconcernedOf course you are The tributes were necessary to theGames too Until they werent I say And then we werevery disposableright PlutarchThat ends the conversation We wait in silence until mymother finds us Theyll be all right she reports Nopermanent physical injuriesGood Splendid says Plutarch How soon can theybe put to workProbably tomorrow she answers Youll
