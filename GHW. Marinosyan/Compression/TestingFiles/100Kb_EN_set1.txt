     I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed A yellow dressinggownungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air Heheld the bowl aloft and intonedINTROIBO AD ALTARE DEIHalted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarselyCome up Kinch Come up you fearful jesuitSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and theawaking mountains Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat andshaking his head Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hairgrained and hued like pale oakBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartlyBack to barracks he said sternlyHe added in a preachers toneFor this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul andblood and ouns Slow music please Shut your eyes gents One moment Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles Silence allHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call thenpaused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points Chrysostomos Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calmThanks old chap he cried briskly That will do nicely Switch off thecurrent will youHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watchergathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middleages A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lipsThe mockery of it he said gaily Your absurd name an ancient GreekHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapetlaughing to himself Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neckBuck Mulligans gay voice went

going to stay in this towerBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulderGod isnt he dreadful he said frankly A ponderous Saxon He thinksyoure not a gentleman God these bloody English Bursting with moneyand indigestion Because he comes from Oxford You know Dedalus youhave the real Oxford manner He cant make you out O my name for youis the best Kinch the knifebladeHe shaved warily over his chinHe was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said Where ishis guncaseA woful lunatic Mulligan said Were you in a funkI was Stephen said with energy and growing fear Out here in

lather on his razorblade He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastilyScutter he cried thicklyHe came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket saidLend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razorStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatlyThen gazing over the handkerchief he saidThe bards noserag A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreenYou can almost taste it cant youHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay hisfair

Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with youSomeone killed her Stephen said gloomilyYou could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying motherasked you Buck Mulligan said Im hyperborean as much as you But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her And you refused There is something sinister in you He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek A tolerantsmile curled his lipsBut a lovely mummer he murmured to himself Kinch the loveliestmummer of them allHe shaved evenly and with care in silence seriouslyStephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoatsleeve Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heartSilently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faintodour of wetted ashes Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomitingBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorbladeAh poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice I must give you a shirt anda few noserags How are the secondhand breeksThey fit well enough Stephen answeredBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlipThe mockery of it he said

his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skinStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyesThat fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan saysyou have gpi Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman Generalparalysis of the insaneHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunkLook at yourself he said you dreadful bardStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleftby a crooked crack Hair on end As he and others see me Who chose thisface for me This dogsbody to rid of vermin It asks me tooI pinched it out of the skivvys room Buck Mulligan said It does herall right The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi Leadhim not into temptation And her name is UrsulaLaughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyesThe rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said IfWilde were only alive to see youDrawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitternessIt is a symbol of Irish art The cracked lookingglass of a servantBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust themIts not fair to tease you like that Kinch is it he said kindly Godknows you have more spirit than any of themParried again He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his Thecold

the snout of a sleeping whale Stephen freed his armquietlyDo you wish me to tell you he askedYes what is it Buck Mulligan answered I dont remember anythingHe looked in Stephens face as he spoke A light wind passed hisbrow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyesStephen depressed by his own voice saidDo you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeathBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and saidWhat Where I cant remember anything I remember only ideas andsensations Why What happened in the name of GodYou were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to getmore hot water Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom She asked you who was in your roomYes Buck Mulligan said What did I say I forgetYou said

lifting hisbrowsCan you recall brother is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the UpanishadsI doubt it said Stephen gravelyDo you now Buck Mulligan said in the same tone Your reasons prayI fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of MaryAnnBuck Mulligans face smiled with delightCharming he

and asked blandlyIs this the day for your monthly wash KinchThen he said to HainesThe unclean bard makes a point of washing once a monthAll Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let

will let meSpeaking to me They wash and tub and scrub Agenbite of inwitConscience Yet heres a spotThat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced goodBuck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of toneWait till you hear him on Hamlet HainesWell I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came inWould I make any money by it Stephen askedHaines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock saidI dont know Im sureHe strolled out to the doorway Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigourYou put your hoof in it now What did you say that forWell Stephen said The problem is to get money From whom From themilkwoman or from him Its a toss up I thinkI blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibesI see little hope Stephen said from her or from himBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens armFrom me Kinch he saidIn a suddenly changed tone he addedTo tell you the Gods truth I think youre right Damn all else theyare good for Why dont you play them as I do To hell with them all Letus get out of the kipHe stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gownsaying resignedlyMulligan is stripped of his garmentsHe emptied his pockets on to the tableTheres your snotrag he saidAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to themchiding them and to his dangling watchchain His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief God wellsimply have to dress the character I want puce gloves and green bootsContradiction Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradictmyself Mercurial Malachi A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghandsAnd theres your Latin quarter hat he saidStephen picked it up and put it on Haines called to them from thedoorwayAre you coming you fellowsIm ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door Come outKinch You have eaten all we left I suppose Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrowAnd going forth he met ButterlyStephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them outand as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit He put the huge key in his inner pocketAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan askedDid you bring the keyI have it Stephen said preceding themHe walked on Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grassesDown sir How dare you sirHaines askedDo you pay rent for this towerTwelve quid Buck Mulligan saidTo the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulderThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at lastRather bleak in wintertime I should say Martello you call itBilly Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were onthe sea But ours is the omphalosWhat is your idea of Hamlet Haines asked StephenNo no Buck Mulligan shouted in pain Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up Wait tillI have a few pints in me firstHe turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoatYou couldnt manage it under three pints Kinch could youIt has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longerYou pique my curiosity Haines said amiably Is it some paradoxPooh Buck Mulligan said We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxesIts quite simple He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfatherWhat Haines said beginning to point at Stephen He himselfBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bendingin loose laughter said to Stephens earO shade of Kinch the elder Japhet in search of a fatherWere always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines And it israther long to tellBuck Mulligan walking forward again raised his handsThe sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he saidI mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA ISNT ITBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attiresIts a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt againEyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudentThe seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the MuglinsI read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemusedThe Father and the Son idea The Son striving to be atoned with theFatherBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face Helooked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety Hemoved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD    MY MOTHERS A JEW MY FATHERS A BIRD    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARYHe held up a forefinger of warning  IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAINHe tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and runningforward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYEHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole flutteringhis winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet criesHaines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephenand saidWe oughtnt to laugh I suppose Hes rather blasphemous Im not abeliever myself that is to say Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow doesnt it What did he call it Joseph the JoinerThe ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answeredO Haines said you have heard it beforeThree times a day after meals Stephen said drilyYoure not a believer are you Haines asked I mean a believer in thenarrow sense of the word Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal GodTheres only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen saidHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone He sprang it open with his thumb and offered itThank you Stephen said taking a cigaretteHaines helped himself and snapped the case to He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang itopen too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his handsYes of course he said as they went on again Either you believe oryou dont isnt it Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod You dont stand for that I supposeYou behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horribleexample of

wavering line along thepath They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark He wants thatkey It is mine I paid the rent Now I eat his salt bread Give him thekey too All He will ask for it That

seems to meI am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an ItalianItalian Haines saidA crazy queen old and jealous Kneel down before meAnd a third Stephen said there is who wants me for

hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleadingOn his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshapedrecent and damp as a snails

Mychildhood bends beside me Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly Mine is far and his secret as our eyes Secrets silent stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of

cried continually without listeningCochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen saidWill you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restoreorder hereAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternlyWhat is the matter What is it nowTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many formsclosed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the
