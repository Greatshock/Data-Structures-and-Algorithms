     I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl oflather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed A yellow dressinggownungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air Heheld the bowl aloft and intonedINTROIBO AD ALTARE DEIHalted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarselyCome up Kinch Come up you fearful jesuitSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest He facedabout and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and theawaking mountains Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he benttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat andshaking his head Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his armson the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling facethat blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hairgrained and hued like pale oakBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then coveredthe bowl smartlyBack to barracks he said sternlyHe added in a preachers toneFor this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul andblood and ouns Slow music please Shut your eyes gents One moment Alittle trouble about those white corpuscles Silence allHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call thenpaused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here andthere with gold points Chrysostomos Two strong shrill whistles answeredthrough the calmThanks old chap he cried briskly That will do nicely Switch off thecurrent will youHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watchergathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown The plump shadowedface and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middleages A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lipsThe mockery of it he said gaily Your absurd name an ancient GreekHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapetlaughing to himself Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearilyhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as hepropped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl andlathered cheeks and neckBuck Mulligans gay voice went

going to stay in this towerBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulderGod isnt he dreadful he said frankly A ponderous Saxon He thinksyoure not a gentleman God these bloody English Bursting with moneyand indigestion Because he comes from Oxford You know Dedalus youhave the real Oxford manner He cant make you out O my name for youis the best Kinch the knifebladeHe shaved warily over his chinHe was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said Where ishis guncaseA woful lunatic Mulligan said Were you in a funkI was Stephen said with energy and growing fear Out here in

lather on his razorblade He hoppeddown from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastilyScutter he cried thicklyHe came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephensupper pocket saidLend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razorStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner adirty crumpled handkerchief Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatlyThen gazing over the handkerchief he saidThe bards noserag A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreenYou can almost taste it cant youHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay hisfair

Thats why she wontlet me have anything to do with youSomeone killed her Stephen said gloomilyYou could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying motherasked you Buck Mulligan said Im hyperborean as much as you But tothink of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down andpray for her And you refused There is something sinister in you He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek A tolerantsmile curled his lipsBut a lovely mummer he murmured to himself Kinch the loveliestmummer of them allHe shaved evenly and with care in silence seriouslyStephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palmagainst his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny blackcoatsleeve Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heartSilently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted bodywithin its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax androsewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faintodour of wetted ashes Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the seahailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him The ringof bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid A bowl of white chinahad stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which shehad torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomitingBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorbladeAh poor dogsbody he said in a kind voice I must give you a shirt anda few noserags How are the secondhand breeksThey fit well enough Stephen answeredBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlipThe mockery of it he said

his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt thesmooth skinStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with itssmokeblue mobile eyesThat fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan saysyou have gpi Hes up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman Generalparalysis of the insaneHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroadin sunlight now radiant on the sea His curling shaven lips laughed andthe edges of his white glittering teeth Laughter seized all his strongwellknit trunkLook at yourself he said you dreadful bardStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleftby a crooked crack Hair on end As he and others see me Who chose thisface for me This dogsbody to rid of vermin It asks me tooI pinched it out of the skivvys room Buck Mulligan said It does herall right The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi Leadhim not into temptation And her name is UrsulaLaughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephens peeringeyesThe rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said IfWilde were only alive to see youDrawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitternessIt is a symbol of Irish art The cracked lookingglass of a servantBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephens and walked withhim round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where hehad thrust themIts not fair to tease you like that Kinch is it he said kindly Godknows you have more spirit than any of themParried again He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his Thecold

the snout of a sleeping whale Stephen freed his armquietlyDo you wish me to tell you he askedYes what is it Buck Mulligan answered I dont remember anythingHe looked in Stephens face as he spoke A light wind passed hisbrow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points ofanxiety in his eyesStephen depressed by his own voice saidDo you remember the first day I went to your house after my mothersdeathBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and saidWhat Where I cant remember anything I remember only ideas andsensations Why What happened in the name of GodYou were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to getmore hot water Your mother and some visitor came out of thedrawingroom She asked you who was in your roomYes Buck Mulligan said What did I say I forgetYou said

lifting hisbrowsCan you recall brother is mother Grogans tea and water pot spoken ofin the Mabinogion or is it in the UpanishadsI doubt it said Stephen gravelyDo you now Buck Mulligan said in the same tone Your reasons prayI fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of theMabinogion Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of MaryAnnBuck Mulligans face smiled with delightCharming he

and asked blandlyIs this the day for your monthly wash KinchThen he said to HainesThe unclean bard makes a point of washing once a monthAll Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let

will let meSpeaking to me They wash and tub and scrub Agenbite of inwitConscience Yet heres a spotThat one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbolof Irish art is deuced goodBuck Mulligan kicked Stephens foot under the table and said withwarmth of toneWait till you hear him on Hamlet HainesWell I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen I was justthinking of it when that poor old creature came inWould I make any money by it Stephen askedHaines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast ofthe hammock saidI dont know Im sureHe strolled out to the doorway Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephenand said with coarse vigourYou put your hoof in it now What did you say that forWell Stephen said The problem is to get money From whom From themilkwoman or from him Its a toss up I thinkI blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come alongwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibesI see little hope Stephen said from her or from himBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephens armFrom me Kinch he saidIn a suddenly changed tone he addedTo tell you the Gods truth I think youre right Damn all else theyare good for Why dont you play them as I do To hell with them all Letus get out of the kipHe stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gownsaying resignedlyMulligan is stripped of his garmentsHe emptied his pockets on to the tableTheres your snotrag he saidAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to themchiding them and to his dangling watchchain His hands plunged andrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief God wellsimply have to dress the character I want puce gloves and green bootsContradiction Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradictmyself Mercurial Malachi A limp black missile flew out of his talkinghandsAnd theres your Latin quarter hat he saidStephen picked it up and put it on Haines called to them from thedoorwayAre you coming you fellowsIm ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door Come outKinch You have eaten all we left I suppose Resigned he passed out withgrave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrowAnd going forth he met ButterlyStephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them outand as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and lockedit He put the huge key in his inner pocketAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan askedDid you bring the keyI have it Stephen said preceding themHe walked on Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavybathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grassesDown sir How dare you sirHaines askedDo you pay rent for this towerTwelve quid Buck Mulligan saidTo the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulderThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at lastRather bleak in wintertime I should say Martello you call itBilly Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were onthe sea But ours is the omphalosWhat is your idea of Hamlet Haines asked StephenNo no Buck Mulligan shouted in pain Im not equal to ThomasAquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up Wait tillI have a few pints in me firstHe turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks ofhis primrose waistcoatYou couldnt manage it under three pints Kinch could youIt has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longerYou pique my curiosity Haines said amiably Is it some paradoxPooh Buck Mulligan said We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxesIts quite simple He proves by algebra that Hamlets grandson isShakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his ownfatherWhat Haines said beginning to point at Stephen He himselfBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bendingin loose laughter said to Stephens earO shade of Kinch the elder Japhet in search of a fatherWere always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines And it israther long to tellBuck Mulligan walking forward again raised his handsThe sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he saidI mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this towerand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore THAT BEETLES OER HISBASE INTO THE SEA ISNT ITBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen butdid not speak In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image incheap dusty mourning between their gay attiresIts a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt againEyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudentThe seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for thesmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tackingby the MuglinsI read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemusedThe Father and the Son idea The Son striving to be atoned with theFatherBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face Helooked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which hehad suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety Hemoved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering andbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice  IM THE QUEEREST YOUNG FELLOW THAT EVER YOU HEARD    MY MOTHERS A JEW MY FATHERS A BIRD    WITH JOSEPH THE JOINER I CANNOT AGREE    SO HERES TO DISCIPLES AND CALVARYHe held up a forefinger of warning  IF ANYONE THINKS THAT I AMNT DIVINE    HELL GET NO FREE DRINKS WHEN IM MAKING THE WINE    BUT HAVE TO DRINK WATER AND WISH IT WERE PLAIN    THAT I MAKE WHEN THE WINE BECOMES WATER AGAINHe tugged swiftly at Stephens ashplant in farewell and runningforward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like finsor wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYE WRITE DOWN ALL I SAID    AND TELL TOM DIEK AND HARRY I ROSE FROM THE DEAD    WHATS BRED IN THE BONE CANNOT FAIL ME TO FLY    AND OLIVETS BREEZY  GOODBYE NOW GOODBYEHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole flutteringhis winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercurys hat quivering in the freshwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet criesHaines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephenand saidWe oughtnt to laugh I suppose Hes rather blasphemous Im not abeliever myself that is to say Still his gaiety takes the harm out of itsomehow doesnt it What did he call it Joseph the JoinerThe ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answeredO Haines said you have heard it beforeThree times a day after meals Stephen said drilyYoure not a believer are you Haines asked I mean a believer in thenarrow sense of the word Creation from nothing and miracles and apersonal GodTheres only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen saidHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled agreen stone He sprang it open with his thumb and offered itThank you Stephen said taking a cigaretteHaines helped himself and snapped the case to He put it back in hissidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang itopen too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towardsStephen in the shell of his handsYes of course he said as they went on again Either you believe oryou dont isnt it Personally I couldnt stomach that idea of a personalGod You dont stand for that I supposeYou behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horribleexample of

wavering line along thepath They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark He wants thatkey It is mine I paid the rent Now I eat his salt bread Give him thekey too All He will ask for it That

seems to meI am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an ItalianItalian Haines saidA crazy queen old and jealous Kneel down before meAnd a third Stephen said there is who wants me for

hair and scraggy neck gave witness ofunreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleadingOn his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshapedrecent and damp as a snails

Mychildhood bends beside me Too far for me to lay a hand there once orlightly Mine is far and his secret as our eyes Secrets silent stonysit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of

cried continually without listeningCochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen saidWill you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restoreorder hereAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voicecried sternlyWhat is the matter What is it nowTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many formsclosed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the

ignorance They actedaccording to their lightsFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the NorthCircular road It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such animportant thoroughfare

Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of adreadful catastrophe in New York In America those things werecontinually happening Unfortunate people to die like that unpreparedStill an act of perfect contritionFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergins publichouse against thewindow of which two unlabouring men lounged They saluted him andwere salutedFather Conmee passed H J ONeills funeral

bargeman with a hat of dirtystraw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar abovehim It was idyllic and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of theCreator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out andbring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor peopleOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee SJ of saintFrancis Xaviers church upper Gardiner street stepped on to an outwardbound tramOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas DudleyC C of saint Agathas church north William street on to NewcomenbridgeAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward boundtram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud IslandFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tuckedwith care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings asixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into hispurse Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspectorusually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticketThe solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmeeexcessive for a journey so short and cheap Father Conmee liked cheerfuldecorumIt was a peaceful day The gentleman with the glasses opposite FatherConmee had finished explaining and looked down His wife FatherConmee supposed A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentlemanwith the glasses She raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gentlytiptapping  her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinilysweetlyFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car He perceived alsothat the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge ofthe seatFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in themouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky headAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go anold woman rose suddenly from her place to alight The conductor pulledthe bellstrap to stay the car for her She passed out with her basket anda marketnet and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net andbasket down and Father Conmee thought that as she had nearly passedthe end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had alwaysto be told twice BLESS YOU MY CHILD that they have been absolved PRAYFOR ME But they had so many worries in life so many cares poorcreaturesFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips atFather ConmeeFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellowmen and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver SJ and the African missionand of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brownand yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their lasthour came like a thief in the night That book by the Belgian jesuit LENOMBRE DES ELUS seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea Those weremillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom thefaith had not DV been brought But they were Gods souls created byGod It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost awaste if one might sayAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted was saluted by theconductor and

the seas adjoiningThen came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one dayThose were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old timesin the baronyFather Conmee walking thought

ample underleaves The sky showed him a flock ofsmall white clouds going slowly down the wind MOUTONNER the Frenchsaid A just and homely wordFather Conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoningclouds over Rathcoffey His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubbleof Clongowes field He walked there reading in the evening and heard thecries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet eveningHe was their rector his reign was mildFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary outAn ivory bookmark told him the pageNones He should have read that

to murmur to himself in a faltering undertoneGod blimey if she aint a clinker that there bleeding tart Blimey itmakes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when I sees her cause Ithinks of my old mashtub whats waiting for me down Limehouse waySo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and thecorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that cant speaktheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone fora quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump thathe cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and theantitreating league and drink the curse of Ireland Antitreatingis about the size of it Gob hed let you pour all manner of drinkdown his throat till the Lord would call him before youd eversee the froth of his pint And

badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lotof colleen bawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medalsand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns gob flahoolaghentertainment dont be talking Ireland sober is Ireland free And thenan old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougersshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of And one or two skypilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the femaleshitting below the beltSo howandever as I was saying the old dog seeing the tin was emptystarts mousing around by Joe and me Id train him by

andgrousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and thehydrophobia dropping out of his jawsAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture amongthe lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of notmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by thefamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the SOBRIQUET ofGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends andacquaintances Owen Garry The exhibition which is the result of years oftraining by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system comprisesamong other achievements the recitation of verse Our greatest livingphonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stoneunturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and hasfound it bears a STRIKING resemblance the italics are ours to the rannsof ancient Celtic bards We are not speaking so much of those delightfullovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under thegraceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised thebookloving world but rather as a contributor D O C points out in aninteresting communication published by an evening contemporary of theharsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusionsof the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a moremodern lyrist at present very much in the public eye We subjoin aspecimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholarwhose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose thoughwe believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rathermore than an indication The metrical system of the canine originalwhich recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules ofthe Welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe ourreaders will agree that the spirit has been well caught Perhapsit should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owensverse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestiveof suppressed rancour    THE CURSE OF MY CURSES    SEVEN DAYS EVERY DAY    AND SEVEN DRY THURSDAYS    ON YOU BARNEY KIERNAN    HAS NO SUP OF WATER    TO

like a shot off a shovel          The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysteriousembrace Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of alltoo fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proudpromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay onthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and last but not least on thequiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness thevoice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to thestormtossed heart of man Mary star of the seaThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the eveningscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly Many a time and oftwere they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chatbeside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine Cissy Caffrey andEdy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and JackyCaffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps tomatch and the name HMS Belleisle printed on both For Tommy andJacky Caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiledtwins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merryfaces and endearing ways about them They were dabbling in the sand withtheir spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing withtheir big coloured ball happy as the day was long And Edy Boardman wasrocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that younggentleman fairly chuckled with delight He was but eleven months and ninedays old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp hisfirst babyish words Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fatlittle plucks and the dainty dimple in his chinNow baby Cissy Caffrey said Say out big big I want a drink ofwaterAnd baby prattled after herA jink a jink a jawboCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of childrenso patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got totake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose andpromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrupon What a persuasive power that girl had But to be sure baby Boardmanwas as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib None ofyour spoilt beauties Flora MacFlimsy sort was Cissy CaffreyA truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh inher gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips agirl lovable in the extreme And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaintlanguage of little brotherBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommyand Master Jacky Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exceptionto this golden rule The apple of discord was a certain castle of sandwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrongthat it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like theMartello tower had But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky wasselfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little Irishmans houseis his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that thewouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castletoo Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew theattention of the girl friendsCome here Tommy his sister called imperatively At once And youJacky for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand Wait till I catchyou for thatHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call fortheir big sisters word was law with the twins And in a sad plight he wastoo after his misadventure His little manowar top and unmentionableswere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothingover lifes tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand wasto be seen on his smart little suit Still the blue eyes were glisteningwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness andshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was nearhim she wouldnt be far from him her eyes dancing in admonitionNasty bold Jacky she criedShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winninglyWhats your name Butter and creamTell us who is your sweetheart spoke Edy Boardman Is Cissy yoursweetheartNao tearful Tommy saidIs Edy Boardman your sweetheart Cissy queriedNao Tommy saidI know Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance fromher shortsighted eyes I know who is Tommys sweetheart Gerty isTommys sweetheartNao Tommy said on the verge of tearsCissys quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whisperedto Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where thegentleman couldnt see and to mind he didnt wet his new tan shoesBut who was GertyGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions lost inthought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair aspecimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see She waspronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said shewas more a Giltrap than a MacDowell Her figure was slight and gracefulinclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking oflate had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welchsfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to getand that tired feeling The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritualin its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupidsbow Greekly perfect Her hands were of finely veined alabasterwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointmentscould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid glovesin bed or take a milk footbath either Bertha Supple told that onceto Edy Boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggersdrawn with Gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffsfrom time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not tolet on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed neverspeak to her again No Honour where honour is due There was aninnate refinement a languid queenly HAUTEUR about Gerty whichwas unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instepHad kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree inher own right and had she only received the benefit of a good educationGerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in theland and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow andpatrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirsto her Mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent toher softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaningthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charmfew could resist Why have women such eyes of witchery Gertys were ofthe bluest Irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressivebrows Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive It wasMadame Vera Verity directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the PrincessNovelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave thathaunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion andshe had never regretted it Then there was blushing scientifically curedand how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face butyour nose That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one ButGertys crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair It was dark brownwith a natural wave in it She had cut it that very morning on accountof the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion ofluxuriant clusters and pared her nails too Thursday for wealth And justnow at Edys words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintestrosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlishshyness that of a surety Gods fair land of Ireland did not holdher equalFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes She wasabout to retort but something checked the words on her tongue Inclinationprompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent The pretty lipspouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous littlelaugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning She knewright well noone better what made squinty Edy say that because of himcooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel As perusual somebodys nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycleoff the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of herwindow Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studyinghard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he wasgoing to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he leftthe high school like his brother W E Wylie who was racing in thebicycle races in Trinity college university Little recked he perhapsfor what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimespiercing to the core Yet he was young and perchance he mightlearn to love her in time They were protestants in his familyand of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the BlessedVirgin and then Saint Joseph But he was undeniably handsome with anexquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman theshape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would knowanywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle atthe lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of thosegood cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she andthat was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever becausehe didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a gardenGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary ofDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might beout A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because itwas expected in the LADYS PICTORIAL that electric blue would be wornwith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocketin which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with herfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and anavy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim gracefulfigure to perfection She wore a coquettish little love of a hat ofwideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggbluechenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone All Tuesdayweek afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at lastshe found what she wanted at Clerys summer sales the very it slightlyshopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny Shedid it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on thensmiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to herAnd when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that thatwould take the shine out of some people she knew Her shoes were thenewest thing in footwear Edy Boardman prided herself that she was veryPETITE but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell a five and neverwould ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle overher higharched instep Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfectproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more ofher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and widegarter tops As for undies they were Gertys chief care and who that knowsthe fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though Gerty wouldnever see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her She hadfour dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments andnighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbonsrosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herselfand blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed themand she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trustthose washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the thingsShe was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her owncolour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhereon her because the green she wore that day week brought grief becausehis father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibitionand because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she wasdressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside outand that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things oninside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so longas it wasnt of a FridayAnd yet and yet That strained look on her face A gnawing sorrow isthere all the time Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worldsto be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way totears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough nottoo much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror You arelovely Gerty it said The paly light of evening falls upon a faceinfinitely sad and wistful Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain Yes she hadknown from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has beenarranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T C Dbecause the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie and inthe fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuousconfection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be He wastoo young to understand He would not believe in love a womansbirthright The night of the party long ago in Stoers he was still inshort trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waistshe went white to the very lips He called her little one in a strangelyhusky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the endof her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark aboutrefreshments Impetuous fellow Strength of character had never been ReggyWylies strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must bea man among men But waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leapyear too and would soon be over No prince charming is her beau ideal tolay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with astrong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightlyflecked with grey and who would understand take her in his shelteringarms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate natureand comfort her with a long long kiss It would be like heaven For sucha one she yearns this balmy summer eve With all the heart of her shelongs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sicknessin health till death us two part from this to this day forwardAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she wasjust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself hislittle wife to be Then they could talk about her till they went blue inthe face Bertha Supple too and Edy little spitfire because she wouldbe twentytwo in November She would care for him with creature comfortstoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked thatfeeling of hominess Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue andqueen Anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions fromall because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in thefine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then creamthe milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt likethe eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often shewondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses andthey would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures andengravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltraps lovely dogGarryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for thechairs and that silver toastrack in Clerys summer jumble sales like theyhave in rich houses He would be tall with broad shoulders she had alwaysadmired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under hiscarefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continentfor their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settleddown in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning theywould both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own twoselves and before he went out to business he would give his dear littlewifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyesEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes sothen she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to runoff and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight But Tommysaid he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with theball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but Tommy said it washis ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if youplease The temper of him O he was a man already was little TommyCaffrey since he was out of pinnies Edy told him no no and to be off nowwith him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to himYoure not my sister naughty Tommy said Its my ballBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up look up high at herfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand andTommy after it in full career having won the dayAnything for a quiet life laughed CissAnd she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heresthe lord mayor heres his two horses heres his gingerbread carriageand here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin But Edygot as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that fromeveryone always petting himId like to give him something she said so I would where I wont sayOn the beeoteetom laughed Cissy merrilyGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissysaying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of herlife to say flushing a deep rosy red and Edy Boardman said she was surethe gentleman opposite heard what she said But not a pin cared CissLet him she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of hernose Give it to him too on the same place as quick as Id look at himMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls You had to laugh at hersometimes For instance when she asked you would you have some moreChinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mensfaces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when shewanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit tothe Miss White That was just like Cissycums O and will you ever forgether the evening she dressed up in her fathers suit and hat and the burnedcork moustache and walked down Tritonville road smoking a cigaretteThere was none to come up to her for fun But she was sincerity itselfone of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of yourtwofaced things too sweet to be wholesomeAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and thepealing anthem of the organ It was the mens temperance retreat conductedby the missioner the reverend John Hughes S J rosary sermon andbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament They were there gatheredtogether without distinction of social class and a most edifyingspectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the wavesafter the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet ofthe immaculate reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loretobeseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar wordsholy Mary holy virgin of virgins How sad to poor Gertys earsHad her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink bytaking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in PearsonsWeekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none Over andover had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brownstudy without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazingout of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rustybucket thinking But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearthsand homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days Nay she had evenwitnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance andhad seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forgethimself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gertyknew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way ofkindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the lowAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerfulVirgin most merciful And Gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard hercompanions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman offSandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so likehimself passing along the strand taking a short walk You never saw himany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for afather because he was too old or something or on account of his face itwas a palpable case of Doctor Fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimpleson it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose Poor fatherWith all his faults she loved him still when he sang TELL ME MARY HOW TOWOO THEE or MY LOVE AND COTTAGE NEAR ROCHELLE and they had stewed cocklesand lettuce with Lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang THEMOON HATH RAISED with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried Godhave mercy on him from a stroke Her mothers birthday that was andCharley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs andPatsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group takenNoone would have thought the end was so near Now he was laid to restAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest ofhis days and he couldnt even go to the funeral on account of the gout andshe had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from hisoffice about Catesbys cork lino artistic standard designs fit for apalace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the homeA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the housea ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in goldAnd when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was itrubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didnt likeher mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thingthey ever had words about taking snuff Everyone thought the world of herfor her gentle ways It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main everynight and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where shenever forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocerschristmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman inthe costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering abunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her latticewindow You could see there was a story behind it The colours were donesomething lovely She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitudeand the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocratShe often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certainpurpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers withthe sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found outin Walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrapabout the halcyon days what they meantThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till atlast Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no gettingbehind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could downtowards the seaweedy rocks Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow tovoice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting thereby himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball Our twochampions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid troubleCissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please Thegentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strandtowards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right underGertys skirt near the little pool by the rock The twins clamoured againfor it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it soGerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt comerolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and CissylaughedIf you fail try again Edy Boardman saidGerty smiled assent and bit her lip A delicate pink crept into herpretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted herskirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jollygood kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towardsthe shingle Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attentionon account of the gentleman opposite looking She felt the warm flush adanger signal always with Gerty MacDowell surging and flaming into hercheeks Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual butnow under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the facethat met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemedto her the saddest she had ever seenThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted andwith it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain oforiginal sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray forus vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose And carewornhearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erredand wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright withhope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the greatsaint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary the most pious Virginsintercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those whoimplored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by herThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles ofchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers Cissy Caffrey played withbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air Peepshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissygone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah and my worddidnt the little chap enjoy that And then she told him to say papaSay papa baby Say pa pa pa pa pa pa paAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent foreleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of healtha perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to besomething great they saidHaja ja ja hajaCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to situp properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried outholy saint Denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanketthe other way under him Of course his infant majesty was mostobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know itHabaa baaaahabaaa baaaaAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks It was all nouse soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about thegeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss always readywitted gave himin his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen wasquickly appeasedGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out ofthat and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little bratsof twins She gazed out towards the distant sea It was like the paintingsthat man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and sucha pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and theclouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music likethat and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like akind of waft And while she gazed her heart went pitapat Yes it was herhe was looking at and there was meaning in his look His eyes burned intoher as though they would search her through and through read her verysoul Wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trustthem People were so queer She could see at once by his dark eyes and hispale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo shehad of Martin Harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which shepreferred because she wasnt stagestruck like Winny Rippingham thatwanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but shecould not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly RETROUSSE fromwhere he was sitting He was in deep mourning she could see that and thestory of a haunting sorrow was written on his face She would have givenworlds to know what it was He was looking up so intently so still andhe saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel bucklesof her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes downShe was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockingsthinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away Here was that ofwhich she had so often dreamed It was he who mattered and there was joyon her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that hewas like noone else The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him herdreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him If he hadsuffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had beenhimself a sinner a wicked man she cared not Even if he was a protestantor methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her Therewere wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm She was a womanly womannot like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclistsshowing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all toforgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forgetthe memory of the past Then mayhap he would embrace her gently like areal man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girliefor herself aloneRefuge of sinners Comfortress of the afflicted ORA PRO NOBIS Wellhas it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy cannever be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for theafflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heartGerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glasswindows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of theblessed Virgins sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon OHanlon atthe altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down He lookedalmost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark andhis hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nunin their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novenaof Saint Dominic He told her that time when she told him about that inconfession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could seenot to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we wereall subject to natures laws he said in this life and that that was nosin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God he saidand that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it doneunto me according to Thy Word He was so kind and holy and often and oftenshe thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroideredfloral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock shenoticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came outof a little house to tell the time the day she went there about theflowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know whatsort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views ofDublin or some placeThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jackythrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it Littlemonkeys common as ditchwater Someone ought to take them and give thema good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both ofthem And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because theywere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drownedJacky TommyNot they What a great notion they had So Cissy said it was the verylast time shed ever bring them out She jumped up and called them and sheran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a goodenough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerryshe was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because itwasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it She ranwith long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt atthe side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboyabout Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thoughtshe had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runnershe ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoatrunning and her skinny shanks up as far as possible It would haveserved her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentallyon purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her looktall and got a fine tumble TABLEAU That would have been a very charmingexpose for a gentleman like that to witnessQueen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saintsthey prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handedthe thurible to Canon OHanlon and he put in the incense and censed theBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she wasitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didnt becauseshe thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake inall her life because Gerty could see without looking that he nevertook his eyes off of her and then Canon OHanlon handed the thuribleback to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacramentand the choir began to sing the TANTUM ERGO and she just swung her footin and out in time as the music rose and fell to the TANTUMER GOSACRAMEN TUM Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrowsof Georges street on the Tuesday no the Monday before Easter and therewasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparentand not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor formthe cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the differencefor himselfCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball withher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streeltugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only afortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanginglike a caricature Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle herhair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen ona girls shouldersa radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening inits sweetness You would have to travel many a long mile before you founda head of hair the like of that She could almost see the swift answeringflash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerveShe put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim andswung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught theexpression in his eyes He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey Herwomans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at thethought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colourof her face became a glorious roseEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gertyhalf smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse thebaby Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was whynoone could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern ofhers And she said to GertyA penny for your thoughtsWhat replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teethI was only wondering was it lateBecause she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and theirbabby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave agentle hint about its being late And when Cissy came up Edy asked her thetime and Miss Cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissingtime time to kiss again But Edy wanted to know because they were told tobe in earlyWait said Cissy Ill run ask my uncle Peter over there whats the timeby his conundrumSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take hishand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with hiswatchchain looking up at the church Passionate nature though he wasGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself One moment hehad been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and thenext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressedin every line of his distinguishedlooking figureCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was theright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to itand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry hiswatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sunwas set His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke inmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tonesCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle saidhis waterworks were out of orderThen they sang the second verse of the TANTUM ERGO and CanonOHanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down andhe told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fireto the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and shecould see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works andshe swung her leg more in and out in time It was getting darker but hecould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch orwhatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands backinto his pockets She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her andshe knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her staysthat that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when sheclipped her hair on account of the moon His dark eyes fixed themselveson her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at hershrine If ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionategaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face It is for youGertrude MacDowell and you know itEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gertynoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect becauseit was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push upthe pushcar and Cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair tomake herself attractive of course and Canon OHanlon stood up with hiscope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to readoff and he read out PANEM DE COELO PRAESTITISTI EIS and Edy and Cissy weretalking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could paythem back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politenesswhen Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing herover Gerty winced sharply A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes thatspoke volumes of scorn immeasurable It hurtO yes it cut deep becauseEdy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would woundlike the confounded little cat she was Gertys lips parted swiftly toframe the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throatso slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artistmight have dreamed of She had loved him better than he knewLighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would neverunderstand what he had meant to her and for an instant there wasin the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears Their eyes wereprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back insympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to seeO responded Gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud headflashed up I can throw my cap at who I like because its leap yearHer words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of theringdove but they cut the silence icily There was that in her youngvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled withAs for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could justchuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would shecast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcardinto a dozen pieces And if ever after he dared to presume shecould give him one look of measured scorn that would make himshrivel up on the spot Miss puny little Edys countenance fell tono slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black asthunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it thelittle kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousyand they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another spherethat she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody elsetoo that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipeand smoke itEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissytucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time toobecause the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior AndCissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to godeedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleefuleyes and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy andbaby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to alland sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bibO my Puddeny pie protested Ciss He has his bib destroyedThe slight CONTRETEMPS claimed her attention but in two twos she setthat little matter to rightsGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough andEdy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it wasflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed itoff with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction becausejust then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashorebecause Canon OHanlon was up on the altar with the veil that FatherConroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the BlessedSacrament in his handsHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse ofErin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a batflew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with atiny lost cry And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses sopicturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it waseasier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going hisrounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shadyTritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near herwindow where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in thatbook THE LAMPLIGHTER by Miss Cummins author of MABEL VAUGHAN andother tales For Gerty had her dreams that noone knew of She loved toread poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovelyconfession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in shelaid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not erron the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean It was thereshe kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs herchild of Mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine heralabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things camehome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts writtenin it in violet ink that she bought in Helys of Dame Street forshe felt that she too could write poetry if she could only expressherself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she hadcopied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs ARTTHOU REAL MY IDEAL it was called by Louis J Walsh Magherafelt andafter there was something about TWILIGHT WILT THOU EVER and ofttimesthe beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had mistedher eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slippingby for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew sheneed fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkeyhill and she always tried to conceal it But it must end she feltIf she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holdingback for her Love laughs at locksmiths She would make the greatsacrifice Her every effort would be to share his thoughts Dearer thanthe whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happinessThere was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he amarried man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like thenobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her putinto a madhouse cruel only to be kind But even ifwhat then Would itmake a very great difference From everything in the least indelicate herfinebred nature instinctively recoiled She loathed that sort of personthe fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that wentwith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girls honourdegrading the sex and being taken up to the police station No no notthat They would be just good friends like a big brother and sisterwithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a bigess Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the daysbeyond recall She thought she understood She would try to understandhim because men were so different The old love was waiting waitingwith little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes Heartof mine She would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heartthat told her he was her all in all the only man in all the worldfor her for love was the master guide Nothing else mattered Come whatmight she would be wild untrammelled freeCanon OHanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacleand genuflected and the choir sang LAUDATE DOMINUM OMNES GENTES andthen he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over andFather Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasntshe coming but Jacky Caffrey called outO look CissyAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too overthe trees beside the church blue and then green and purpleIts fireworks Cissy Caffrey saidAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and thechurch helterskelter Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it andCissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldnt fall runningCome on Gerty Cissy called Its the bazaar fireworksBut Gerty was adamant She had no intention of being at their beck andcall If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she couldsee from where she was The eyes that were fastened upon her sether pulses tingling She looked at him a moment meeting his glanceand a light broke in upon her Whitehot passion was in that face passionsilent as the grave and it had made her his At last they were leftalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew hecould be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man ofinflexible honour to his fingertips His hands and face were workingand a tremour went over her She leaned back far to look up wherethe fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as notto fall back looking up and there was noone to see only him andher when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like thatsupply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the pantingof his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passionof men like that hotblooded because Bertha Supple told her once in deadsecret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that wasstaying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had picturescut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said heused to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes inthe bed But this was altogether different from a thing like thatbecause there was all the difference because she could almost feelhim draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of hishandsome lips Besides there was absolution so long as you didntdo the other thing before being married and there ought to bewomen priests that would understand without your telling out andCissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy lookin her eyes so that she too my dear and Winny Rippingham so madabout actors photographs and besides it was on account of that otherthing coming on the way it didAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned backand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and theyall saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leanedback ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flyingthrough the air a soft thing to and fro dark And she saw a long Romancandle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hushthey were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higherand she had to lean back more and more to look up after it highhigh almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divinean entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her otherthings too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skinbetter than those other pettiwidth the green four and elevenon account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and thenit went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling inevery limb from being bent so far back that he had a full viewhigh up above her knee where noone ever not even on the swing or wadingand she wasnt ashamed and he wasnt either to look in that immodest waylike that because he couldnt resist the sight of the wondrous revealmenthalf offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemenlooking and he kept on looking looking She would fain have cried to himchokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel hislips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girls love a littlestrangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the agesAnd then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O then the Romancandle burst and it was like a sigh of O and everyone cried O O inraptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads andthey shed and ah they were all greeny dewy stars falling with goldenO so lovely O soft sweet softThen all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent Ah Sheglanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance ofpiteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girlHe was leaning back against the rock behind Leopold Bloom for it is hestands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes What abrute he had been At it again A fair unsullied soul had called to himand wretch that he was how had he answered An utter cad he had beenHe of all men But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyesfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned andwandered Should a girl tell No a thousand times no That was theirsecret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none toknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the eveningto and fro and little bats dont tellCissy Caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to showwhat a great person she was and then she criedGerty Gerty Were going Come on We can see from farther upGerty had an idea one of loves little ruses She slipped a hand intoher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of coursewithout letting him and then slipped it back Wonder if hes too far toShe rose Was it goodbye No She had to go but they would meet againthere and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream ofyester eve She drew herself up to her full height Their souls met in alast lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of astrange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face She halfsmiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged ontears and then they partedSlowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand toCissy to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey to little baby Boardman It wasdarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippyseaweed She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her butwith care and very slowly becausebecause Gerty MacDowell was Tight boots No Shes lame OMr

woman that lay therein childbed The nursingwoman answered him and said that that womanwas in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unnethto bear but that now in a little it would be She said thereto that shehad seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was thatwomans birth Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew theman that time was had lived nigh that house The man hearkened to herwords for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have ofmotherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face forany man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid Ninetwelve bloodflows chiding her childlessAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and therenighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat And therecame against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept DixonAnd the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that theyhad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where thislearningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healedfor he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible anddreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve ofvolatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice And he said now thathe should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that werethere And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither forhe was a man of cautels and a subtile Also the lady was of his avis andrepreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller hadsaid thing that was false for his subtility But the learningknight wouldnot hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious tohis list and he said how it was a marvellous castle And the travellerLeopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore oflimb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime veneryAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood ofFinlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but theydurst not move more for enchantment And on this board were frightfulswords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons outof white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags thatthere abound marvellously And there were vessels that are wrought bymagic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breaththat he blases in to them like to bubbles And full fair cheer and richwas on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer And therewas a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which laystrange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that thisbe possible thing without they see it natheless they are so And thesefishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land becauseof the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepressAnd also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they makea compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid ofcertain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously liketo a vast mountain And they teach the serpents there to entwinethemselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales ofthese serpents they brew out a brewage like to meadAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halpthereto the while all they that were there drank every each And childeLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat inamity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by andanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and hisneighbour nist not of this wile And he sat down in that castle with themfor to rest him there awhile Thanked be Almighty GodThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them atthe reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing forthere was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fastSir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry thatit was whether of child or woman and I marvel said he that it be notcome or now Meseems it dureth overlong And he was ware and saw afranklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than anyof the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the oneemprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gentlyBut said he or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty andhave joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long And thefranklin that had drunken said Expecting each moment to be her nextAlso he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never noneasking nor desiring of him to drink and Now drink said he fullydelectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths healthfor he was a passing good man of his lustiness And sir Leopoldthat was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall andthat was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandlyhand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the worldone that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly inthe cup Womans woe with wonder ponderingNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to bedrunken an they might There was a sort of scholars along either side theboard that is to wit Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciables withother his fellows Lynch and Madden scholars of medicine and the franklinthat hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa one Crotthers and youngStephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board andCostello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of himerewhile gested and of all them reserved young Stephen he was the mostdrunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sirLeopold But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised tohave come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had brokehis avow And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendshipto sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languorbecalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feastedhim for that time in the honourablest manner Ruth red him love ledon with will to wander loth to leaveFor they were right witty scholars And he heard their aresouns eachgen other as touching birth and righteousness young Madden maintainingthat put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen outa matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Hornes house thatnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before herdeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case And theysaid farther she should live because in the beginning they said thewoman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of thisimagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscienceto let her die And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubtthat the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeitthe mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges didprovide no remedy A redress God grant This was scant said but all criedwith one acclaim nay by our Virgin Mother the wife should live and thebabe to die In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what withargument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompteach when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lackThen young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she wasdead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and fora vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband wouldnot let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved To whom youngStephen had these words following Murmur sirs is eke oft among layfolk Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker the one in limbogloom the other in purgefire But gramercy what of those Godpossibledsouls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the HolyGhost Very God Lord and Giver of Life For sirs he said our lustis brief We are means to those small creatures within us and naturehas other ends than we Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wisthe what ends But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he couldhave of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she wereor wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of hisspleen of lustihead Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang youngMalachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millenniumhe cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward withtheir jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and severalby saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any mannerof thing that lay in man to do Thereat laughed they all rightjocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laughtoo open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray andalso for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoeverThen spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast himout of her bosom of law of canons of Lilith patron of abortions of bignesswrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth tomouth or as Virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reekof moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain withEFFECTU SECUTO or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions ofAverroes and Moses Maimonides He said also how at the end of the secondmonth a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldethever souls for Gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which wasbut a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeththe fishermans seal even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy churchfor all ages founded All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would hein like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life A wariness ofmind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he saiddissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had everloved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with hisexperience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Churchbelike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly hescaped their questions That is truth pardy said Dixon and or I erra pregnant word Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man andhe averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for hewas of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in thattaking it appeared eftsoonsBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he stillhad pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labourand as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an onlymanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of artcould save so dark is destiny And she was wondrous stricken of heart forthat evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambswool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lieakeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now SirLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him hisfriends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness andas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for allaccounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure foryoung Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels andmurdered his goods with whoresAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood emptyso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed theirapproach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for theintentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicarof Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray Now drink we quod heof this mazer and quaff ye this mead

hospitality that wassending over Doctor Rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in allMuscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull bythe horns Come come says Mr Vincent plain dealing Hell find himselfon the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats Irish says heIrish by name and irish by nature says Mr Stephen and he sent the alepurling about an Irish bull in an English chinashop I conceive you saysMr Dixon It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmerNicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emeraldring in his nose True for you says Mr Vincent cross the tableand a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlierbull says he never shit on shamrock He had horns galore a coat ofcloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils sothat the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpinsfollowed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychainsWhat for that says Mr Dixon but before he came over farmerNicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctorswho were no better off than himself So be off now says he and do all mycousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmers blessing andwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly But the slap and theblessing stood him friend says Mr Vincent for to make up he taught him atrick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to thisday affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his earin the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holytongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the fourfields of all Ireland Another then put in his word And they dressed himsays he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle andruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all overwith spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of theroad with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the marketso that he could doss and dung to his hearts content By this timethe father of the faithful for so they called him was grown soheavy that he could scarce walk to pasture To remedy which ourcozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlapsand as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uartersto show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bullslanguage and they all after him Ay says another and so pampered was hethat he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass forhimself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a boardput up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed noticesaying By the Lord Harry Green is the grass that grows on the groundAnd says Mr Dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommonor the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowingas much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed runamok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whateverwas planted and all by lord Harrys orders There was bad blood betweenthem at first says Mr Vincent and the lord Harry called farmerNicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster thatkept seven trulls in his house and Ill meddle in his matterssays he Ill make that animal smell hell says he with the helpof that good pizzle my father left me But one evening says MrDixon when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinnerafter winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first ruleof the course was that the others were to row with pitchforkshe discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on pickingup a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sureenough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bullof the Romans BOS BOVUM which is good bog Latin for boss of theshow After that says Mr Vincent the lord Harry put his head intoa cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers andpulling it out again told them all his new name Then with the waterrunning off him he got into an old smock and skirt that hadbelonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bullslanguage to study but he could never learn a word of it except the firstpersonal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if everhe went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it uponwhat took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale ofcotton or a corkfloat In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon asfast friends as an arse and a shirt They were says Mr Stephen and theend was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as theungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselvesand their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect mannedthe yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the windput her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ranup the jolly Roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushedoff in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of AmericaWhich was the occasion says Mr Vincent of the composing by a boatswainof that

with a friendwhom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name Alec Bannonwho had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or acornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars Mr Mulligan was civilenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with aproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched onWhereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which hehad had printed that day at Mr Quinnells bearing a legend printed in fairitalics MR MALACHI MULLIGAN FERTILISER AND INCUBATOR LAMBAY ISLAND Hisproject as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idlepleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sirMilksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task forwhich our bodily organism has been framed Well let us hear of it goodmy friend said Mr Dixon I make no doubt it smacks of wenching Come beseated both Tis as cheap sitting as standing Mr Mulligan accepted ofthe invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that hehad been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes ofsterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibitionin its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of thebalance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defectscongenital or from proclivities acquired It grieved him plaguily hesaid to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and toreflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to thevilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenialcloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountablemuskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing theinestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows wereat hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weepTo curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppressionof latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worthand inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in feesimple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holderlord Talbot de Malahide a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with ourascendancy party He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farmto be named OMPHALOS with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion ofEgypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of anyfemale of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him withthe desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural Money was noobject he said nor would he take a penny for his pains The poorestkitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be theirconstructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitionswould find in him their man For his nutriment he shewed how he wouldfeed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish andconeys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highlyrecommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade ofmace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies After this homily which hedelivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put offfrom his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it They both itseems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pacehad taken water as might be observed by Mr Mulligans smallclothes of ahodden grey which was now somewhat piebald His project meanwhile wasvery favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies fromall though Mr Dixon of Marys excepted to it asking with a finicking airdid he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle Mr Mulligan however madecourt to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which asit dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support ofhis contention TALIS AC TANTA DEPRAVATIO HUJUS SECULI O QUIRITES UTMATRESFAMILIARUM NOSTRAE LASCIVAS CUJUSLIBET SEMIVIRI LIBICI

overjoyed as he was at apassage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell ithis nearest neighbour Mr Mulligan now perceiving the table asked forwhom were those loaves and fishes and seeing

replied that he was comethere about a lady now an inmate of Hornes house that was in aninteresting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetcheda deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet

create themselves wits at the cost of femininedelicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he wouldconcede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a properbreeding

while the above was goingon were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation wasas astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjecturedthe contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrongshop During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hardat a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co atBurtononTrent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of othersright opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated toattract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance He wassimply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best knownto himself which put quite an altogether different complexion onthe proceedings after the moment befores observations about boyhooddays and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions ofhis own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babeunborn Eventually however both their eyes met and as soon asit began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to helphimself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himselfand so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glassrecipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacioushole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same timehowever a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upsetany of the beer that was in it about the placeThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome ofthe course of life Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity Thedebaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on theloftiest and most vital The high hall of Hornes house had never beheld anassembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of

young poet who found a refuge from his labours ofpedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere ofSocratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated theflippant

no lureor peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of thatvoluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned forages yet to comeIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the pervertedtranscendentalism to which Mr S Dedalus Div Scep contentions wouldappear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to acceptedscientific methods Science it cannot be too often repeated deals withtangible phenomena The man of science like the man in the street has toface hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best hecan There may be it is true some questions which science cannotanswerat presentsuch as the first problem submitted by Mr L Bloom PubbCanv regarding the future determination of sex Must we accept the viewof Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual periodassert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too longneglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it asmost embryologists incline to opine such as Culpepper SpallanzaniBlumenbach Lusk Hertwig Leopold and Valenti a mixture of both Thiswould be tantamount to a cooperation one of natures favourite devicesbetween the NISUS FORMATIVUS of the nemasperm on the one hand and on theother a happily chosen position SUCCUBITUS FELIX of the passive element Theother

isundoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting tocount the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to benormative In fact when one comes to look into it the wonder isthat so

IVORY CANE WITH A VIOLETBOWKNOT A WHITE LAMBKIN PEEPS OUT OF HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET     III Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulkof the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked himup generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly neededHis Stephens mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but abit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink MrBloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry wateravailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon anexpedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabmansshelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridgewhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk andsoda or a mineral But how to get there was the rub For the nonce he wasrather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him totake some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means duringwhich Stephen repeatedly yawned So far as he could see he was rather palein the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyanceof some description which would answer in their then condition both ofthem being eded particularly Stephen always assuming that there wassuch a thing to be found Accordingly after a few such preliminaries asbrushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddyhandkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they bothwalked together along Beaver street or more properly lane as far as thefarriers and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at thecorner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thencedebouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergins But ashe confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hireanywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by somefellows inside on the spree outside the North Star hotel and there was nosymptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom who wasanything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting akind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twiceThis was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on itevidently there was nothing for it butput a good face on the matter and footit which they accordingly did So bevelling around by Mulletts and theSignal House which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in thedirection of Amiens street railway terminus Mr Bloom being handicappedby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to varythe timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though enteringthoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of themischance So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as ithappened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recentvisitation of Jupiter Pluvius they dandered along past by where the emptyvehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey As it so happened a DublinUnited Tramways Companys sandstrewer happened to be returning andthe elder man recounted to his companion A PROPOS of the incident his owntruly miraculous escape of some little while back They passed the mainentrance of the Great Northern railway station the starting point forBelfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour andpassing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to saygruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the DockTavern and in due course turned into Store street famous for itsC division police station Between this point and the high at present unlitwarehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsenassociated with Bairds the stonecutters in his mind somehow in Talbotplace first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidusAchates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourkes citybakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odourindeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary andmost indispensable Bread the staff of life earn your bread O tell me whereis fancy bread at Rourkes the bakers it is saidEn route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yetperfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in completepossession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spokea word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swellmobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as ahabitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for youngfellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits underthe influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for everycontingencyas even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick ifyou didnt look out Highly providential was the appearance on the scene ofCorny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that manin the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that hemight have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that thebridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or hebeing the solicitor rather old Wall he meant to say or Mahony whichsimply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about The reason hementioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordiallydisliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and asMr Bloom put it recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassilstreet prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot Never on the spotwhen wanted but in quiet parts of the city Pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being theywere paid to protect the upper classes Another thing he commented on wasequipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to gooff at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civiliansshould by any chance they fall out over anything You frittered away yourtime he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besideswhich the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ranaway with a lot of l s d into the bargain and the greatest danger of all waswho you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question ofstimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably agood burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond acertain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to troubleall round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of otherspractically Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephenby all his pubhunting confreres but one a most glaring piece of ratting onthe part of his brother medicos under all the circsAnd that one was Judas Stephen said who up to then had said nothingwhatsoever of any kindDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across theback of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where abrazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like oneattracted their rather lagging footsteps Stephen of his own accord stoppedfor no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by thelight emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure ofthe corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox He began toremember that this had happened or had been mentioned as havinghappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered thathe recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his fathers Gumley Toavoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridgeSomeone saluted you Mr Bloom saidA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the archessaluted again callingNightStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return thecompliment Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuchas he always believed in minding his own business moved off butnevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety thoughnot funkyish in the least Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew thatit was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothingto live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceablepedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outsidethe city proper famished loiterers of the Thames embankment categorythey might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decampwith whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments noticeyour money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged andgarrottedStephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quartersthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corleys breathredolent of rotten cornjuice Lord John Corley some called him and hisgenealogy came about in this wise He was the eldest son of inspectorCorley of the G division lately deceased who had married a certainKatherine Brophy the daughter of a Louth farmer His grandfatherPatrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publicanthere whose maiden name had been Katherine also Talbot Rumour had itthough not proved that she descended from the house of the lords Talbotde Malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence ofits kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative awoman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction ofbeing in service in the washkitchen This therefore was the reason why thestill comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressedStephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord JohnCorleyTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tellNot as much as a farthing to purchase a nights lodgings His friends hadall deserted him Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him toStephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of otheruncalledfor expressions He was out of a job and implored of Stephen totell him where on Gods earth he could get something anything at all to doNo it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that wasfostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through themother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if thewhole thing wasnt a complete fabrication from start to finish Anyhow hewas all inI wouldnt ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and God knowsIm on the rocksTherell be a job tomorrow or next day Stephen told him in a boysschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher Mr Garrett Deasy Try it You maymention my nameAh God Corley replied sure I couldnt teach in a school man I wasnever one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh I got stuck twicein the junior at the christian brothersI have no place to sleep myself Stephen informed himCorley at the first gooff was inclined to suspect it was something todo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart offthe street There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street Mrs Maloneysbut it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but MConachie toldhim you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavernstreet which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friarBacon for a bob He was starving too though he hadnt said a word about itThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near itstill Stephens feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew thatCorleys brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deservingof much credence However haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere discoetcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he gotpaid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which wasthe date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of thewherewithal was demolished But the cream of the joke was nothing wouldget it out of Corleys head that he was living in affluence and hadnt a thingto do but hand out the needful Whereas He put his hand in a pocketanyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he mightlend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at allevents and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for tohis chagrin he found his cash missing A few broken biscuits were all theresult of his investigation He tried his hardest to recollect for the momentwhether he had lost as well he might have or left because in thatcontingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact Hewas altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he triedto recollect About biscuits he dimly remembered Who now exactly gavethem he wondered or where was or did he buy However in another pockethe came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneouslyhowever as it turned outThose are halfcrowns man Corley corrected himAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be Stephen anyhow lenthim one of themThanks Corley answered youre a gentleman Ill pay you back onetime Whos that with you I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse inCamden street with Boylan the billsticker You might put in a good wordfor us to get me taken on there Id carry a sandwichboard only the girl inthe office told me theyre full up for the next three weeks man God youveto book ahead man youd think it was for the Carl Rosa I dont give ashite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeperSubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two andsix he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of BagsComisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullams theshipchandlers bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Naglesback with OMara and a little chap with a stutter the name of TigheAnyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunkand disorderly and refusing to go with the constableMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of thecobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporationwatchmans sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him washaving a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own privateaccount while Dublin slept He threw an odd eye at the same time now andthen at Stephens anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if hehad seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in aposition to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when Being alevelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewdobservation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchywearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity Palpably hewas one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a questionof one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to putit a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chancedto be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a finewould be a very rara avis altogether In any case he had a consummateamount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night ormorning Pretty thick that was certainlyThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who withhis practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to theblandiloquence of the other parasite Alluding to the encounter he saidlaughingly Stephen that isHe is down on his luck He asked me to ask you to ask somebody namedBoylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichmanAt this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest MrBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in thedirection of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblanamoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repairwhereupon he observed evasivelyEverybody gets their own ration of luck they say Now you mention ithis face was familiar to me But leaving that for the moment how much didyou part with he queried if I am not too inquisitiveHalf a crown Stephen responded I daresay he needs it to sleepsomewhereNeeds Mr Bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at theintelligence I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariablydoes Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deedsBut talking about things in general where added he with a smile will yousleep yourself Walking to Sandycove is out of the question And evensupposing you did you wont get in after what occurred at Westland Rowstation Simply fag out there for nothing I dont mean to presume to dictateto you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your fathers houseTo seek misfortune was Stephens answerI met your respected father on a recent occasion Mr Bloomdiplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate onyesterday Where does he live at present I gathered in the course ofconversation that he had movedI believe he is in Dublin somewhere Stephen answered unconcernedlyWhyA gifted man Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior in more respects thanone and a born raconteur if ever there was one He takes great pride quitelegitimate out of you You could go back perhaps he hasarded stillthinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when itwas perfectly evident that the other two Mulligan that is and that Englishtourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion werepatently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to giveStephen the slip in the confusion which they didThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however suchas it was Stephens minds eye being too busily engaged in repicturing hisfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by theingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa thatwas in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink itwith the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten attwo a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy Boody and Katey the catmeanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fishheads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the thirdprecept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it beingquarter tense or if not ember days or something like thatNo Mr Bloom repeated again I wouldnt personally repose much trust inthat boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element DrMulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes Heknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he neverrealised what it is to be without regular meals Of course you didnt noticeas much as I did But it wouldnt occasion me the least surprise to learn thata pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulteriorobjectHe understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was aversatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who wasrapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified badefair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tonymedical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition towhich professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning byartificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries or Malahidewas it was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which hecould not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss tofathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it downto sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simpleExcept it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call pickingyour brains he ventured to throw outThe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented byfriendliness which he gave at Stephens at present morose expression offeatures did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem asto whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or threelowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through theaffair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed mattersto more or less Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more thanconjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed heexperienced no little difficulty in making both ends meetAdjacent to the mens public urinal they perceived an icecream carround which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation weregetting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in aparticularly animated way there being some little differences between thepartiesPuttana madonna che ci dia i quattrini Ho ragione Culo rottoIntendiamoci Mezzo sovrano piu Dice lui peroMezzoFarabutto Mortacci suiMa ascolta Cinque la testa piu Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabmans shelter anunpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if everbeen before the former having previously whispered to the latter a fewhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous SkintheGoatFitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual factswhich quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in A few momentslater saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to begreeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs andstrays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already thereengaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom theyseemingly formed an object of marked curiosityNow touching a cup of coffee Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest tobreak the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape ofsolid food say a roll of some

it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds itThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this teteatete put a boilingswimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and arather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed After which he beata retreat to his counter Mr Bloom determining to have a good square lookat him later on so as not to appear to For which reason he encouragedStephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiouslypushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffeegradually nearer himSounds are impostures Stephen said after a pause of some little time likenames Cicero Podmore Napoleon Mr Goodbody Jesus Mr DoyleShakespeares were as common as Murphies Whats in a nameYes to be sure Mr Bloom unaffectedly

turned to the other occupants of the shelter withthe remarkI seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over hisshoulder The lefthand dead shotThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and hisgestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explainBottles out there say Fifty yards measured Eggs on the bottles Cockshis gun over his shoulder AimsHe

husband D B MurphyThe sailor who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident turned toone of the jarvies with the requestYou dont happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about youThe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a dieof plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object waspassed from hand to handThank you the sailor saidHe deposited the quid in his

that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extentbut he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he hadconsistently remained a landlubber except you call going to

on account of them usingknivesAt this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance isbliss Mr B and Stephen each in his own particular way both instinctivelyexchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nousvariety however towards where SkintheGoat alias the keeper notturning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair Hisinscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itselfbeggaring description conveyed the impression that he didnt understandone jot of what was going on Funny veryThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause One man was reading in fitsand starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with thenatives choza de another the seamans discharge Mr Bloom so far as hewas personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood He vividlyrecollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterdayroughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubleswhen it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in theeighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteenAy boss the sailor broke in Give us back them papersThe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrapeHave you seen the rock of Gibraltar Mr Bloom inquiredThe sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ayor noAh youve touched there too Mr Bloom said Europa point thinking hehad in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but hefailed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust andshook his head with a sort of lazy scornWhat year would that be about Mr B interrogated Can you recall theboatsOur soidisant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily beforeansweringIm tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships Saltjunk all the timeTired seemingly he ceased His questioner perceiving that he was notlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell towoolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globesuffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it coveredfully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant torule the waves On more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near theNorth Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidentlyderelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on thewall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woodsand pastures new as someone somewhere sings And it left him wondering whyPossibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up anddown the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well notexactly under tempting the fates And the odds were twenty to nil there wasreally no secret about it at all Nevertheless without going into theminutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there inall its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had tosail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show howpeople usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow likethe hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically thesame lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat Sunday was ahighly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter whereliving inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to themlike that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters andcoastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid theelements whatever the season when duty called Ireland expects that every manand so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime notforgetting the Irish lights Kish and others liable to capsize at any momentrounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkablychoppy not to say stormy weatherThere was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover the old seadog himselfa rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentlemansvalet at six quid a month Them are his trousers Ive on me and he gave mean oilskin and that jackknife Im game for that job shaving and brushupI hate roaming about Theres my son now Danny run off to sea and hismother got him took in a drapers in Cork where he could be drawing easymoneyWhat age is he queried one hearer who by the way seen from the sidebore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell the townclerk away fromthe carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and astrong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendageWhy the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son DannyHed be about eighteen now way I figure itThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or uncleananyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on whichwas to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to representan anchorThere was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts Imust get a wash tomorrow or next day Its them black lads I objects to Ihate those buggers Suck your blood dry they doesSeeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly draggedhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of themariners hope and rest they had a full view of the figure  and a youngmans sideface looking frowningly ratherTattoo the exhibitor explained That was done when we were Iyingbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow thename of Antonio done that There he is himself a GreekDid it hurt much doing it one asked the sailorThat worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round theSomeway in his Squeezing orSee here he said showing Antonio There he is cursing the mate Andthere he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with hisfingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarnAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonios livid face didactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited theunreserved admiration of everybody including SkintheGoat who thistime stretched overAy ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest Hes gonetoo Ate by sharks after Ay ayHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expressionof beforeNeat bit of work one longshoreman saidAnd whats the number for loafer number two queriedEaten alive a third asked the sailorAy ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time withsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction ofthe questioner about the number Ate A Greek he wasAnd then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering hisalleged endAs bad as old AntonioFor he left me on my ownioThe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black strawhat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring onher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill Mr Bloomscarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the momentflusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheetof the Abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid asidehe picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink Hisreason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door thesame face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormondquay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady inthe brown costume does be with you Mrs B and begged the chance of hiswashing Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not yourwashing Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wifesundergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did tooa mans similar garments initialled with Bewley and Drapers marking inkhers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me lovemy dirty shirt Still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the femalesroom more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keepermade her a rude sign to take herself off Round the side of the EveningTelegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of thedoor with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactlyall there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers roundskipper Murphys nautical chest and then there was no more of herThe gunboat the keeper saidIt beats me Mr Bloom confided to Stephen medically I am speaking howa wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with diseasecan be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if hevalues his health in the least Unfortunate creature Of course I supposesome man is ultimately responsible for her condition Still no matter whatthe cause is from Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merelyremarkingIn this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaringtrade Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soulShe is a bad merchant She buys dear and sells cheapThe elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or aprude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put astop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from anyoldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil w ere notlicensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he couldtruthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from thevery first start Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort he said andventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybodyconcernedYou as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe inthe soul Or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such asdistinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup I believein that myself because it has been explained by competent men as theconvolutions of the grey matter Otherwise we would never have suchinventions as X rays for instance Do youThus cornered Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memoryto try and concentrate and remember before he could sayThey tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and thereforeincorruptible It would be immortal I understand but for the possibility ofits annihilation by its First Cause Who from all I can hear is quite capableof adding that to the number of His other practical jokes corruptio per seand corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquetteMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though themystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he feltbound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoiningSimple I shouldnt think that is the proper word Of course I grant youto concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moonBut what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to inventthose rays Rontgen did or the telescope like Edison though I believe it wasbefore his time Galileo was the man I mean and the same applies to thelaws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricitybut its a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existenceof a supernatural GodO that Stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several ofthe bestknown passages in Holy Writ apart from circumstantial evidenceOn this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as theywere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference intheir respective ages clashedHas been the more experienced of the two objected sticking to hisoriginal point with a smile of unbelief Im not so sure about that Thats amatter for everymans opinion and without dragging in the sectarian sideof the business I beg to differ with you in toto there My belief is to tellyou the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them putin by monks most probably or its the big question of our national poet overagain who precisely wrote them like Hamlet and Bacon as you who knowyour Shakespeare infinitely better than I of course I neednt tell you Cantyou drink that coffee by the way Let me stir it And take a piece of thatbun Its like one of our skippers bricks disguised Still noone can givewhat he hasnt got Try a bitCouldnt Stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the momentrefusing to dictate furtherFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well tostir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with somethingapproaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance andlucrative work To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or naydid a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run onteetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and usefullectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders On theother hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wifeMadam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it atone time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying Theidea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profitthere being no competition to speak of Sulphate of copper poison SO orsomething in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheapeatinghouse somewhere but he couldnt remember when it was or whereAnyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him morethan ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr TibblesViCocoa on account of the medical analysis involvedHave a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mugfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle andtook a sip of the offending beverageStill its solid food his good genius urged Im a stickler for solid foodhis one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regularmeals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manualYou ought to eat more solid food You would feel a different manLiquids I can eat Stephen said But O oblige me by taking away thatknife I cant look at the point of it It reminds me of Roman historyMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminatedarticle a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularlyRoman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was theleast conspicuous point about itOur mutual friends stories are like himself Mr Bloom apropos of knivesremarked to his confidante sotto voce Do you think they are genuine Hecould spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old bootsLook at himYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was fullof a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quitewithin the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication thoughat first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he gotoff his chest being strictly accurate gospelHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of himand Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him Thougha wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness therewas something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail deliveryand it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such aweirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity He mighteven have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as peopleoften did about others namely that he killed him himself and had servedhis four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of theAntonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical namewho sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes inthe melodramatic manner above described On the other hand he might beonly bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugsDublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would temptany ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow aboutthe schooner Hesperus and etcetera And when all was said and done thelies a fellow told about himself couldnt probably hold a proverbial candleto the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about himMind you Im not saying that its all a pure invention he resumedAnalogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with Giants thoughthat is rather a far cry you see once in a way Marcella the midget queen Inthose waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs as they arecalled sitting bowlegged they couldnt straighten their legs if you paidthem because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on hiscompanion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call thembehind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so longcramped up being adored as gods Theres an example again of simplesoulsHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventureswho reminded him a bit of Ludwig alias Ledwidge when he occupied theboards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with themanagement in the Flying Dutchman a stupendous success and his host ofadmirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear himthough ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell abit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatibleabout it he conceded On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quitein keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free toadmit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chippotato variety and so forth over in little

Spanish half that is Point of fact she could actually claimSpanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically Spainie Gibraltar She has the Spanish type Quite dark regular brunette blackI for one certainly believe climate accounts for character Thats why Iasked you if you wrote your poetry in ItalianThe temperaments at the door Stephen interposed with were verypassionate about ten shillings Roberto ruba roba suaQuite so Mr Bloom dittoedThen Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknownlistener somewhere we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isoscelestriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san TommasoMastinoIts in the blood Mr Bloom acceded at once All are washed in the bloodof the sun Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it and I was justlooking at those antique statues there The splendid proportions of hipsbosom You simply dont knock against those kind of women here An exceptionhere and there Handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what Imtalking about is the female form Besides they have so little taste in dressmost of them which greatly enhances a womans natural beauty no matterwhat you say Rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine butstill its a thing I simply hate to seeInterest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and thenthe others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog goocollisions with icebergs all that sort of thing Shipahoy of course had hisown say to say He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered amonsoon a kind of wind in the China seas and through all those perils ofthe deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to thateffect a pious medal he had that saved himSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunts rock wreckof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for themoment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbellremembered it Palme on Booterstown strand That was the talk of the townthat year Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times breakers running overher and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified withhorror Then someone said something about the case of the s s LadyCairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack inrather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck No aid was givenHer master the Monas said he was afraid his collision bulkhead wouldgive way She had no water it appears in her holdAt this stage an incident happened It having become necessary forhim to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seatLet me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was justgently dropping off into a peaceful dozeHe made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to thedoor stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter andbore due left While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom whonoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ships rumsticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burninginterior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applyingits nozze to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with agurgling noise The irrepressible Bloom who also had a shrewd suspicionthat the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction inthe shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents andpurposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by hisrum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop linerather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since hislast visit and greatly improved Some person or persons invisible directed himto the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place forthe purpose but

Japs were going to have their little lookin heaffirmed The Boers were the beginning of the end Brummagem Englandwas toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland her Achilles heelwhich he

noIrishman worthy of his salt that served it Then they began to have a fewirascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to thelisteners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as theydidnt indulge in recriminations and come to blowsFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloomwas rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdashfor pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for hewas fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channelunless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealedtheir strength than the opposite It was quite on a par with the quixotic ideain certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of thesister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out tobe how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as ahost of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then itwas highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countrieseven though poles apart Another little interesting point the amours ofwhores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him Irishsoldiers had as often fought for England as against her more so in factAnd now why So the scene between the pair of them the licensee of theplace rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris the famous invincible andthe other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours withthe confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookerona student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the gameAnd as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasnt the other person at allhe B couldnt help feeling and most properly it was better to give peoplelike that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse tohave anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and theirfelonsetting there always being the offchance of a Dannyman comingforward and turning queens evidence or kings now like Denis or PeterCarey an idea he utterly repudiated Quite apart from that he dislikedthose careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle Yet though suchcriminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shapeor form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remainingwhat he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actuallybrandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictionsthough personally he would never be a party to any such thing off thesame bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for herwhen the husband frequently after some words passed between the twoconcerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had thepair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of analternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it juststruck him that Fitz nicknamed Skinthe merely drove the car for the      actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliablyinformed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the pleasome legal luminary saved his skin on In any case that was very ancienthistory by now and as for our friend the pseudo Skintheetcetera he hadtransparently outlived his welcome He ought to have either died naturallyor on the scaffold high Like actresses always farewell positively lastperformance then come up smiling again Generous to a fault of coursetemperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping atthe bone for the shadow So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion thatMr Johnny Lever got rid of some l s d in the course of his perambulations                              round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland taverncome back to Erin and so on Then as for the other he had heard not solong before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply buteffectually silenced the offenderHe took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on thewhole eventempered person declared I let slip He called me a jew and in aheated fashion offensively So I without deviating from plain facts in theleast told him his God I mean Christ was a jew too and all his family likeme though in reality Im not That was one for him A soft answer turnsaway wrath He hadnt a word to say for himself as everyone saw Am I notright He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous darkpride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemedto glean in a kind of a way that it wasnt all exactly Ex quibus Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or foureyes conversing Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any othersecundum carnemOf course Mr B proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides ofthe question It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right andwrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though everycountry they say our own distressful included has the government itdeserves But with a little goodwill all round Its all very fine to boast ofmutual superiority but what about mutual equality I resent violence andintolerance in any shape or form It never reaches anything or stopsanything A revolution must come on the due instalments plan Its a patentabsurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the cornerand speak another vernacular in the next house so to speakMemorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war Stephenassented between Skinners alley and Ormond marketYes Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed entirely endorsing the remark thatwas overwhelmingly right And the whole world was full of that sort ofthingYou just took the words out of my mouth he said A hocuspocus ofconflicting evidence that candidly you couldnt remotely All those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up badblood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kinderroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag werevery largely a question of the money question which was at the back ofeverything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stopThey accuse remarked he audiblyHe turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer toso as the others in case theyJews he softly imparted in an aside in Stephens ear are accused ofruining Not a vestige of truth in it I can safely say History would you besurprised to learn proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisitionhounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell anuncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer forimported them Why Because they are imbued with the proper spirit Theyare practical and are proved to be so I dont want to

compared with goahead America TurksIts in the dogma Because if they didnt believe theyd go straight to heavenwhen they die theyd try to live better at least so I think Thats thejuggle on which the pps raise the wind on false pretences Im he resumedwith dramatic force as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you aboutat the outset and I want to see everyone concluded he all creeds and classespro rata having a comfortable tidysized income in no niggard fashioneither something in the neighbourhood of  pounds per annum Thats thevital issue at stake and its feasible and would be provocative of friendlierintercourse between man and man At least thats my idea for what itsworth I call that patriotism Ubi patria as we learned a smattering of inour classical days in Alma Mater vita bene Where you can live well thesense is if you workOver his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to thissynopsis of things in general Stephen stared at nothing in particular Hecould hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabsabout Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours ofdifferent sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneathor seemed to Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didnt say thewords the voice he heard said if you workCount me out he managed to remark meaning workThe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the personwho owned them pro tem observed or rather his voice speaking did allmust work have to togetherI mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widestpossible sense Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thingWriting for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays Thatswork too Important work After all from the little I know of you after allthe money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourselfand command your price You have every bit as much right to live by yourpen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has What You bothbelong to Ireland the brain and the brawn Each is equally importantYou suspect Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Irelandfor shortI would go a step farther Mr Bloom insinuatedBut I suspect Stephen interrupted that Ireland must be importantbecause it belongs to meWhat belongs queried Mr Bloom bending fancying he was perhapsunder some misapprehension Excuse me Unfortunately I didnt catch thelatter portion What was it you Stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mugof coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding  We cant change the country Let us change the subjectAt this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom to change the subject lookeddown but in a quandary as he couldnt tell exactly what construction to puton belongs to which sounded rather a far cry The rebuke of some kind wasclearer than the other part Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgyspoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his soberstate Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importancehad not been all that was needful or he hadnt been familiarised with theright sort of people With a touch of fear for the young man beside himwhom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris the eyes more especiallyreminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light onthe subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows thatpromised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody toblame but themselves For instance there was the case of OCallaghan forone the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequatemeans with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rottoand making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habitof ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact And thenthe usual denouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after astrong hint to a

forth and so onAll the same Bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at theirmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and notsingly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it wastwenty odd years Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow oftruth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highlyinadvisable all things considered Something evidently riled them in hisdeath Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when hisvarious different political arrangements were nearing completion orwhether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to changehis boots and clothesafter a wetting when a cold resulted and failing toconsult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died ofit

direction ofthe  door and reflected upon the historic story which had arousedextraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse weremade public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them fullof sweet nothings First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened andan attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climaxand the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came asa welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who wereresolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was publicproperty

necessity toproclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that hehad shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when athrill went through the packed court

repeating itself with adifference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alonein his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to thegraveOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatantjokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and thewherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case forthe two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husbandhappened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usualboy Jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in aloving position locked in one anothers arms drawing attention to theirillicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fairone begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees andpromising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if onlythe aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones bebygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her faircheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others Hepersonally being of a sceptical bias believed and didnt make the smallestbones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were alwayshanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was thebest wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake ofargument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded lifeand was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentionson her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred onanother the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married womengetting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famouscases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hiltIt was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance ofbrains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time withprofligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him hislifetime In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take untohimself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladiessociety was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possibledoubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about MissFerguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought himdown to Irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would findmuch satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and thecompany of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweeklywith the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walkingout leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs To think of himhouse and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmotherwas really too bad at his age The queer suddenly things he popped out withattracted the elder man who was several years the others senior or like hisfather but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it onlyan eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that thehomely Humpty Dumpty boiledAt what oclock did you dine he questioned of the slim form and tiredthough unwrinkled faceSome time yesterday Stephen saidYesterday exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrowFriday Ah you mean its after twelveThe day before yesterday Stephen said improving on himselfLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflectedThough they didnt see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy theresomehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the onetrain of thought At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score ofyears previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentaryhonours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect whichwas a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard forthose same ultra ideas For instance when the evicted tenants question thenat its first inception bulked largely in peoples mind though it goeswithout saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely toits dictums some of which wouldnt exactly hold water he at the outset inprinciple at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession asvoicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realisinghis mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twittedwith going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at onetime inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he stronglyresented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friendat the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernans so that he though oftenconsiderably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be itrepeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphoricallyone in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned hewas only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting frompropaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and sufferingit entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chieflydestruction of the fittest in a wordAnyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as itwas it was high time to be retiring for the night The crux was it was a bitrisky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebodyhaving a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as onthe night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lamepaw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he hadhurt his hand too to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly rememberedhaving been there so to speak On the other hand it was altogether far andaway too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he wasin some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives Everything pointed tothe fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunityall things considered His initial impression was he was a shade standoffishor not over effusive but it grew on him someway For one thing he mightntwhat you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried himwas he didnt know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he didentertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure ifhe would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe iffound suitable At all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for thenonce hidebound precedent a cup of Eppss cocoa and a shakedown forthe night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow atleast he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failedto perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso norumpus of any sort was kicked up A move had to be made because thatmerry old soul the grasswidower in question who

seanceSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left theshelter or shanty together and the elite society of oilskin and companywhom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce farniente Stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged outpaused at the for a moment the doorOne thing I never understood he said to be original on the spur of themoment Why they put tables upside down at night I mean chairs upsidedown on the tables in cafesTo which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without amoments hesitation saying straight offTo sweep the floor in the morningSo saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the sametime apologetic to get on his companions right a habit of his by the byehis right side being in classical idiom his tender Achilles The night airwas certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak onhis pinsIt will the air do you good Bloom said meaning also the walk in amoment The only thing is to walk then youll feel a different man ComeIts not far Lean on meAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephens right and led him onaccordinglyYes Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a

all intents and purposeswrapped in the arms of Murphy as the adage has it dreaming of freshfields and pastures new And apropos of coffin of stones the analogy wasnot at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwoout of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split andchiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants hehad put in their holdingsSo they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for whichBloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracksarm in arm across Beresford place Wagnerian music though confessedlygrand in its way was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at thefirst gooff but the music of Mercadantes Huguenots Meyerbeers SevenLast Words on the Cross and Mozarts Twelfth Mass he simply revelled inthe Gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as suchliterally knocking everything else into a cocked hat He infinitely preferredthe sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop couldoffer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to liveand I will live thy protestant to be He also yielded to none in hisadmiration of Rossinis Stabat Mater a work simply abounding inimmortal numbers in which his wife Madam Marion Tweedy made a hit averitable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laureisand putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church inupper Gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hearher with virtuosos or virtuosi rather There was the unanimous opinionthat there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place ofworship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desirefor an encore On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of theDon Giovanni description and Martha a gem in its line he had a penchantthough with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school suchas Mendelssohn And talking of that taking it for granted he knew all aboutthe old favourites he mentioned par excellence Lionels air in MarthaMappari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be moreaccurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips ofStephens respected father sung to perfection a study of the number infact which made all the others take a back seat Stephen in reply to apolitely put query said he didnt sing it but launched out into praises ofShakespeares songs at least of in or about that period the lutenistDowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist who annosludendo hausi Doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasingfrom Mr Arnold Dolmetsch whom B did not quite recall though the namecertainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son withtheir dux and comes conceits and Byrd William who played the virginalshe said in the Queens chapel or anywhere else he found them and oneTomkins who made toys or airs and John BullOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speakingbeyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the pavenground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloomwas not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion tosixtyfive guineas and John Bull He inquired if it was John Bull the politicalcelebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as astriking coincidenceBy the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceivingBloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the otherssleeve gently jocosely remarkingOur lives are in peril tonight Beware of the steamrollerThey thereupon stopped Bloom looked at the head of a horse notworth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quitenear so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even fleshbecause palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker ataildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lordof his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts But such a goodpoor brute he was sorry he hadnt a lump of sugar but as he wiselyreflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that mightcrop up He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse withouta second care in the world But even a dog he reflected take that mongrelin Barney Kiernans of the same size would be a holy horror to face But itwas no animals fault in particular if he was built that way like the camelship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump Nine tenths ofthem all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barringthe bees Whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of hisback and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eyeThese timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mindsomewhat distracted from Stephens words while the ship of the street wasmanoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting oldWhats this I was saying Ah yes My wife he intimated plunging inmedias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making youracquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kindHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephenimage of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsomeblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after ashe was perhaps not that way builtStill supposing he had his fathers gift as he more than suspected itopened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingalls Irish industriesconcert on the preceding Monday and aristocracy in generalExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here hasEnd by Jans Pieter Sweelinck a Dutchman of

ListigkeitTun die Poeten dichtenThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore Bloomnodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by allmeans which he didA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boonswhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily ifproperly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such asBarraclough

bestresidential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business andtitled people where with his university degree of B A a huge ad in its wayand gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence

to the better worm his way into their goodgraces as he a youthful tyro insocietys sartorial niceties hardlyunderstood how a little thing like that could militate against you It was infact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participatingin their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of theChristmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of thefair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of whichas he happened to know were on recordin fact without giving the showaway he himself once upon a time if he

lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyricplatform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time But a step in therequired direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily andmentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and itoften turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneededmoment when every little helped Besides though taste latterly haddeteriorated to a degree original music like that different from theconventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decidednovelty for Dublins musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchytenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and HiltonSt Just and their genus omne Yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he couldwith all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a namefor himself and win a high place in the citys esteem where he couldcommand a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for thepatrons of the King street house given a backerup if one were forthcomingto kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some impetus of thegoahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often trippedup a too much feted prince of good fellows And it need not detract fromthe other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of timeto practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doingwithout its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatorywhatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone In fact he had the ball athis feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of aremarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at allThe horse was just then And later on at a propitious opportunity hepurposed Bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on thefools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connectionwith a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparageand even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not presentdeprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in Blooms humbleopinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a persons character no punintendedThe horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak haltedand rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall onthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smokingglobes of turds Slowly three times one after another from a full crupper hemired And humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient inhis scythed carSide by side Bloom

problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutuallyselfexcluding propositionsThe irreparability of the past once at a performance of Albert Henglerscircus in the Rotunda Rutland square Dublin an intuitive particolouredclown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in theauditorium where Bloom solitary was seated and had publicly declared toan exhilarated audience that he Bloom was his the clowns papa Theimprevidibility of the future once in the summer of  he Bloom hadmarked a florin  with three notches on the milled edge and tendered itm payment of an account due to

returnedNeverWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress himBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amendmany social conditions the product of inequality and avarice andinternational animosityHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating theseconditionsThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct fromhuman

epicentres of which are located in denselypopulated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions ofmetamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decayWhy did he desist from speculationBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other moreacceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena to beremovedDid Stephen participate in his dejectionHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceedingsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rationalreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon

againdivisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends anddivisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progresswere carried far enough nought nowhere was never reachedWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise resultBecause some years previously in  when occupied with the problem ofthe quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a numbercomputed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of somany places eg the th power of the th power of  that the resulthaving been obtained  closely printed

whenelevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere sufferedwith arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line ofdemarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximatedfrom nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposingthis problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesiswhich could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differentlyanatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise underMartian Mercurial Veneral Jovian Saturnian Neptunian or Uraniansufficient and equivalent conditions though

not a heavenbeast not aheavenman That it was a Utopia there being no known method from theknown to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by thesuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and ofdifferent magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in spaceremobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a presentbefore its probable spectators had entered actual present existenceWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacleIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in thedelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejectioninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satelliteof their planetDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of

City Arms hotel when heused to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness tomake himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought hehad a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herselfand her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out d for hermethylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat inher about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bitof fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down onbathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them Isuppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Illnever be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she wasa welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan hereand Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dogsmelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especiallythen still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters andbeggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he gotanything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to gointo a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring itinto him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing onthe carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybelike the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes becausetheyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get wellif his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one offthe south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at thesugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing himflowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basketanything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice tryingto imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face againthough he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bedfather was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut histoe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if itwas a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course thewoman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhereIm sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking ofher so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he wasreally and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning itHynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton andwho else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not longmarried flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my backon him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he hadthe impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almightyand his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called asolicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not thatits some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on thesly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterdayhe was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to showhim Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered itup with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so veryprobably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him becauseall men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he isnow so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool andthen the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two strawsnow who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find outso long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like thatslut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom toexcite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him onceor twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found thelong hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchenpretending he was drinking water  woman is not enough for them it wasall his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat atour table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my housestealing my potatoes and the oysters  per doz going out to see her aunt ifyou please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something onwith that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have noproof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I toldher what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her Iwouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room theFriday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her faceswelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw tothat better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker onlyfor the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhoweither she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought hewas with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to myface and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she wastoo well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so hemust do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was itthe night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka inmy hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with mythumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming lovebecause he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Imdining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him thesatisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be alwaysand ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to doit since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a littlealone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and makehim turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with thatdown on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hourquestion and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalmanyes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishopwas sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting thatwoollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about themonuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making himworse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking ofwho is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yesimagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of mewhat he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simplyruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it tillhe comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips paleanyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about itpeople make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it andthink no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going andmarrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way sonice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other wouldtake me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothinglike a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hatethat confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me fatherand what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool butwhereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yesrather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottomright out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did youwhatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the realfather what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God hehad a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neitherwould he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know mein the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turnor let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a womanof course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to beembraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like thepope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too carefulabout himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonderwas he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind goingaway so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass amI I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking ofme or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought hesmelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kindof paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip thoserichlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnniesdrink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of thatAmerican that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all hecould do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we tookthe port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovelyand tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I poppedstraight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thoughtthe heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myselfand said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if theworld was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no Godwhat could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only makean act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars streetchapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if heheard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul youhave no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is tohave one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come  or  timeswith that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein orwhatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is notso big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hoursdressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thickcrowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a fewdozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone hadone the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a wholesheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middleof us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they wantout of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut myeyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I madehim pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better incase any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it inme nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but ifsomeone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I wentthrough with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and MinaPurefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with achild or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell ofchildren off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger witha shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was therea squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear yourears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out likeelephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not offhim though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but Idont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly Isuppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about meand Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do himany good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he wasdancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsonshousewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was onaccount of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had thestandup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lordbeing a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitiveabout everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for Iknew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyedme so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedupthings especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study upthat myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could alwayshear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after thatI pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be abit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I saidover to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and thethree pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him tomake it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her againand was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat theonions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouseor touch him with my veil and gloves on going out I kiss then would sendthem all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she ofcourse would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with himthat I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love himand look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine hewas and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner likehe did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though Iliked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for theasking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I wasrolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I puthim off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pastyflour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so Ididnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to bealways embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of courseglauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possibleasking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on tothat putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking abit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kindhe is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was veryhandsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked thoughhe was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engagedafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughingwith the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one afteranother with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she saidyes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used totell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough tomake her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the doormuch after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after livingwith that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawnand run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a rowwith him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down aconversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down whatwas it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with hismuddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get intobed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a manwell its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he doesalways wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and alwaysblacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes upin the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for pounds for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like thatsimply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his bootsoff now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die  times overthan marry another of their sex of course hed never find another womanlike me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yesand he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrickthat poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other manyes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do athing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive youmad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marrythem for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get onwithout us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonderwhy they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us aswise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the otherfellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was hernature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang awoman surely are theytheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot henoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B Cwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we bothordered  teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his twoold maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was whatdo I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he mademe buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself alwayswith some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot mysuede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of awoman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladieslavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I sawhis eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was lookingwhen I looked back and I went there for tea  days after in the hope but hewasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when wewere in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk inmy hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month anice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my footso much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwinsbotchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in thehouse to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off mystockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time itwas my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could findbut of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did hesay I could give  points in  to Katty Lanner and beat her what does thatmean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition justpassed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite Ithink I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting thebutter so I took my time Bartell dArcy too that he used to make fun of whenhe commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods AveMaria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow andpart which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too mylow notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the wayhe used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in aplace like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him aboutthat some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show himthe very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinksnothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about mymother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as hedid he was lo times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bitcut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth squarehe kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking mequestions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let himkeep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into hispocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seenalways skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirtsblowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at theopen air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun sohe could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind followingin the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner ofthe Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in theZingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat lookingslyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they cango and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it andwere not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you whereare you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes onmy neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting toowarm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes tillI took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves weretoo cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear medrawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pairoff my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he didlook a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made mehungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat Ihad on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneeldown in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his newraincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre sosavage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched histrousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keephim from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out washe circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everythingtoo quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all thetime for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and hadto go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all thosewords in it how could he have the face to any woman after his companymanners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have Ioffended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a fewbrains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking ortearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knewwhat it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand youI said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up witha picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt findanywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morninga letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knewthe way to take a woman when he sent me the  big poppies because minewas the th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn Icouldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but henever knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Mondayas he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answerthe door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you allundressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day oldfrostyface Goodwin called

about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife hewent no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince ofWales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some ofthose books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebodysupposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because herbumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her ae as if anyfool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things withthat old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and thatRuby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I cameto page  o the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cordflagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made upabout he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was overlike the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins armssure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought firstit came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when shewanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was inGibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where heplanted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have plantedme too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought tochuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and gointo an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where theycould put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course heprefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whatsyour programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisementswhen he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did thensending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to bethe manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff asthe mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with theold rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in itbut theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knewit was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd andBums as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale alot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills mealtogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress andcooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I wentby his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take thatthats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he saidsuited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins andneedles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had themisfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be withher smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shesthere for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonderbut he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like thesoup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up toopen the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Imextremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked thefirst time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife Ijust half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he saidIm extremely sorry and Im sure you wereyes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long hemade me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiffthe nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill takethose eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are allthose veins and things curious the way its made  the same in case of twinstheyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in themuseum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they sobeautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bagsfull and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you likea hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgustingCameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with thered head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I waspassing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with hisbabyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well theSurreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every timenearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt streetstation just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was Iof the  wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places thenight coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges andlemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into r of them it was sobiting cold I couldnt keep it when was that  the canal was frozen yes itwas a few months after a

job in Helys and I was sellingthe clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath ofthe nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like thatdirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about likethat I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in itand he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never canexplain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes andburns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so muchtheres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had toscream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milkwith Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could havegot a pound a week as a wet

Ulyssesby James JoyceThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy for Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst and all other Arlingtoniansfor tea sympathy and a sofaFar out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable  end  ofthe  western  spiral  arm  of  the Galaxy lies a small unregardedyellow sunOrbiting this at a distance of roughly ninetytwo  million  milesis  an  utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose apedescended life forms are so amazingly primitive that  they  stillthink digital watches are a pretty neat ideaThis planet has  or rather had  a problem which was this mostof  the  people  on  it were unhappy for pretty much of the timeMany solutions were suggested for this problem but most of thesewere  largely  concerned with the movements of small green piecesof paper which is odd because on the whole it wasnt  the  smallgreen pieces of paper that were unhappyAnd so the problem remained lots of the people  were  mean  andmost of them were miserable even the ones with digital watchesMany were increasingly of the opinion that theyd all made a  bigmistake  in  coming  down  from the trees in the first place Andsome said that even the trees had been a bad move  and  that  noone should ever have left the oceansAnd then one Thursday nearly two thousand years after  one  manhad  been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to benice to people for a change one girl sitting on  her  own  in  asmall  cafe  in  Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was thathad been going wrong all this time and she finally knew how  theworld  could  be  made  a  good and happy place This time it wasright it would work and no one would  have  to  get  nailed  toanythingSadly however before she could get to a phone  to  tell  anyoneabout  it  a  terribly stupid catastrophe occurred and the ideawas lost foreverThis is not her storyBut it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and  someof its consequencesIt is also the story of a book a book called The  Hitch  HikersGuide  to  the  Galaxy    not  an Earth book never published onEarth and until the terrible catastrophe occurred never seen orheard of by any EarthmanNevertheless a wholly remarkable bookin fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come outof  the  great  publishing  houses  of  Ursa  Minor  of which noEarthman had ever heard eitherNot only is it a wholly remarkable book  it  is  also  a  highlysuccessful  one    more  popular  than  the  Celestial Home CareOmnibus better selling than Fifty More  Things  to  do  in  ZeroGravity and more controversial than Oolon Colluphids trilogy ofphilosophical blockbusters Where God Went  Wrong  Some  More  ofGods Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person AnywayIn many of the more relaxed civilizations on  the  Outer  EasternRim of the Galaxy the Hitch Hikers Guide has already supplantedthe great Encyclopedia Galactica as the  standard  repository  ofall  knowledge  and  wisdom for though it has many omissions andcontains much that is apocryphal or at least wildly  inaccurateit  scores  over the older more pedestrian work in two importantrespectsFirst it is slightly cheaper and  secondly  it  has  the  wordsDont Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its coverBut the story of this terrible stupid Thursday the story of itsextraordinary   consequences   and   the  story   of  how  theseconsequences are inextricably intertwined  with  this  remarkablebook begins very simplyIt begins with a houseThe house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the villageIt  stood  on  its  own  and  looked  over a broad spread of WestCountry farmland Not a remarkable house by any means    it  wasabout  thirty  years old squattish squarish made of brick andhad four windows set in the front of a size and proportion  whichmore or less exactly failed to please the eyeThe only person for whom the house was in  any  way  special  wasArthur  Dent and that was only because it happened to be the onehe lived in He had lived in it for about three years ever sincehe  had  moved  out  of  London  because  it made him nervous andirritable He was about thirty as well  dark  haired  and  neverquite at ease with himself The thing that used to worry him mostwas the fact that people always used  to  ask  him  what  he  waslooking  so  worried  about  He  worked  in local radio which healways used to tell his friends was a lot more  interesting  thanthey  probably  thought It was too  most of his friends workedin advertisingIt hadnt properly registered with Arthur that the council wantedto knock down his house and build an bypass insteadAt eight oclock on Thursday  morning  Arthur  didnt  feel  verygood  He  woke  up blearily got up wandered blearily round hisroom opened a window saw a bulldozer found his  slippers  andstomped off to the bathroom to washToothpaste on the brush  so ScrubShaving mirror  pointing at the ceiling He adjusted it  For  amoment  it  reflected  a  second  bulldozer  through the bathroomwindow Properly adjusted it reflected Arthur  Dents  bristlesHe shaved them off washed dried and stomped off to the kitchento find something pleasant to put in his mouthKettle plug fridge milk coffee YawnThe word bulldozer wandered through his  mind  for  a  moment  insearch of something to connect withThe bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big oneHe stared at itYellow he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom  to  getdressedPassing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of  waterand  another  He began to suspect that he was hung over Why washe hung over Had he been drinking the night before He  supposedthat  he must have been He caught a glint in the shaving mirrorYellow he thought and stomped on to the bedroomHe stood and thought The pub he thought Oh dear the  pub  Hevaguely remembered being angry angry about something that seemedimportant Hed been telling  people  about  it  telling  peopleabout  it  at  great  length  he  rather suspected his clearestvisual recollection was of glazed looks on other peoples  facesSomething  about a new bypass he had just found out about It hadbeen in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have  knownabout  it  Ridiculous  He  took  a swig of water It would sortitself out hed decided no one wanted  a  bypass  the  councildidnt have a leg to stand on It would sort itself outGod what a terrible hangover it had earned him though He  lookedat  himself  in  the  wardrobe  mirror  He stuck out his tongueYellow he thought The word yellow wandered through  his  mindin search of something to connect withFifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in  frontof a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden pathMr L Prosser was as they say only human In other words he  wasa carbonbased life form descended from an ape More specificallyhe was forty fat and shabby and worked for  the  local  councilCuriously  enough though he didnt know it he was also a directmaleline  descendant  of  Genghis   Khan   though   interveninggenerations  and  racial  mixing had so juggled his genes that hehad  no  discernible  Mongoloid  characteristics  and  the  onlyvestiges  left  in  Mr  L  Prosser  of his mighty ancestry were apronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for  littlefur hatsHe was by no means a great warrior in  fact  he  was  a  nervousworried  man  Today  he  was  particularly  nervous  and worriedbecause something had gone seriously wrong with his job    whichwas  to  see  that Arthur Dents house got cleared out of the waybefore the day was outCome off it Mr Dent he said you cant win  you  know  Youcant  lie  in  front of the bulldozer indefinitely He tried tomake his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldnt do itArthur lay in the mud and squelched at himIm game he said well see who rusts firstIm afraid youre going to have to accept it said  Mr  Prossergripping  his  fur  hat and rolling it round the top of his headthis bypass has got to be built and its going to be builtFirst Ive heard of it said Arthur  whys  it  going  to  bebuiltMr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit  then  stopped  andput it away againWhat do you mean whys it got to be built he  said  Its  abypass Youve got to build bypassesBypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from  pointA  to  point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B topoint A very fast People  living  at  point  C  being  a  pointdirectly  in  between  are often given to wonder whats so greatabout point A that so many people of point B are so keen  to  getthere  and  whats so great about point B that so many people ofpoint A are so keen to get there They  often  wish  that  peoplewould  just  once and for all work out where the hell they wantedto beMr Prosser wanted to be at point D Point D  wasnt  anywhere  inparticular it was just any convenient point a very long way frompoints A B and C He would have a nice little cottage  at  pointD  with  axes over the door and spend a pleasant amount of timeat point E which would be the nearest pub to point D  His  wifeof  course  wanted  climbing roses but he wanted axes He didntknow why  he  just  liked  axes  He  flushed  hotly  under  thederisive grins of the bulldozer driversHe shifted his weight from foot  to  foot  but  it  was  equallyuncomfortable  on  each  Obviously somebody had been appallinglyincompetent and he hoped to God it wasnt himMr Prosser said You were quite entitled to make any suggestionsor protests at the appropriate time you knowAppropriate time hooted Arthur Appropriate time The first Iknew  about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday Iasked him if hed come to clean the windows and he said  no  hedcome  to  demolish  the house He didnt tell me straight away ofcourse Oh no First he wiped a couple of windows and charged  mea fiver Then he told meBut Mr Dent the plans have been available in the local planningoffice for the last nine monthOh yes well as soon as I heard I went  straight  round  to  seethem  yesterday  afternoon  You hadnt exactly gone out of yourway to call attention to them  had  you  I  mean  like  actuallytelling anybody or anythingBut the plans were on display On display I eventually had to go down to the  cellar  to  findthemThats the display departmentWith a torchAh well the lights had probably goneSo had the stairsBut look you found the notice didnt youYes said Arthur yes I did It was on display in  the  bottomof  a  locked  filing  cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with asign on the door saying Beware of the LeopardA cloud passed overhead It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as  helay  propped  up  on  his elbow in the cold mud It cast a shadowover Arthur Dents house Mr Prosser frowned at itIts not as if its a particularly nice house he saidIm sorry but I happen to like itYoull like the bypassOh shut up said Arthur Dent Shut up and go  away  and  takeyour  bloody  bypass  with you You havent got a leg to stand onand you know itMr Prossers mouth opened and closed a couple of times while  hismind  was  for  a  moment  filled  with inexplicable but terriblyattractive visions of Arthur Dents  house  being  consumed  withfire  and  Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruinwith at least three hefty spears protruding  from  his  back  MrProsser  was often bothered with visions like these and they madehim feel very nervous He stuttered for a moment and then  pulledhimself togetherMr Dent he saidHello Yes said ArthurSome factual information for you Have you  any  idea  how  muchdamage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straightover youHow much said ArthurNone at  all  said  Mr  Prosser  and  stormed  nervously  offwondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemenall shouting at himBy a curious  coincidence  None  at  all  is  exactly  how  muchsuspicion  the  apedescendant  Arthur  Dent  had that one of hisclosest friends was not descended from an ape but  was  in  factfrom  a  small  planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not fromGuildford as he usually claimedArthur Dent had never ever suspected thisThis friend of his had first arrived on the planet  some  fifteenEarth  years  previously and he had worked hard to blend himselfinto Earth society  with it must be  said  some  success  Forinstance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an outof work actor which was plausible enoughHe had made one careless blunder though because he had skimped abit  on his preparatory research The information he had gatheredhad led him to choose the name Ford  Prefect  as  being  nicelyinconspicuousHe was not conspicuously tall his features were striking but notconspicuously  handsome  His  hair  was  wiry  and gingerish andbrushed backwards from the temples His skin seemed to be  pulledbackwards  from  the  nose There was something very slightly oddabout him but it was difficult to say what it  was  Perhaps  itwas  that  his eyes didnt blink often enough and when you talkedto him for any length of time your eyes  began  involuntarily  towater  on  his behalf Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly toobroadly and gave people the  unnerving  impression  that  he  wasabout to go for their neckHe struck most of  the  friends  he  had  made  on  Earth  as  aneccentric  but  a  harmless  one    an unruly boozer with someoddish habits For instance he would often  gatecrash  universityparties   get   badly   drunk   and  start  making  fun  of  anyastrophysicist he could find till he got thrown outSometimes he would get seized with  oddly  distracted  moods  andstare  into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him whathe was doing Then he would start guiltily for  a  moment  relaxand grinOh just looking for flying saucers he would joke and everyonewould  laugh  and  ask  him  what  sort  of flying saucers he waslooking forGreen ones he would reply with a wicked grin laugh wildly fora  moment  and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy anenormous round of drinksEvenings like this usually ended badly Ford would get out of hisskull  on whisky huddle into a corner with some girl and explainto her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the  flyingsaucers didnt matter that much reallyThereafter staggering semiparalytic down the night  streets  hewould  often  ask  passing  policemen  if  they  knew  the way toBetelgeuse The  policemen  would  usually  say  something  likeDont you think its about time you went off home sirIm trying to baby Im trying  to  is  what  Ford  invariablyreplied on these occasionsIn fact what he  was  really  looking  out  for  when  he  stareddistractedly  into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer atall The reason he said green was that green was the  traditionalspace livery of the Betelgeuse trading scoutsFord Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer  at  all  wouldarrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get strandedanywhere particularly somewhere as  mindboggingly  dull  as  theEarthFord wished that a flying saucer would  arrive  soon  because  heknew  how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them Heknew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than  thirtyAltairan dollars a dayIn fact Ford Prefect was a roving  researcher  for  that  whollyremarkable book The Hitch Hikers Guide to the GalaxyHuman beings are great adaptors and by  lunchtime  life  in  theenvirons  of Arthurs house had settled into a steady routine Itwas Arthurs accepted role to lie squelching in  the  mud  makingoccasional  demands to see his lawyer his mother or a good bookit was Mr Prossers accepted  role  to  tackle  Arthur  with  theoccasional  new  ploy  such  as the For the Public Good talk theMarch of Progress talk the They Knocked My House Down  Once  YouKnow  Never  Looked  Back  talk and various other cajoleries andthreats and it was the bulldozer drivers accepted role  to  sitaround  drinking  coffee and experimenting with union regulationsto see how they could  turn  the  situation  to  their  financialadvantageThe Earth moved slowly in its diurnal courseThe sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay inA shadow moved across him againHello Arthur said the shadowArthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled  to  seeFord Prefect standing above himFord Hello how are youFine said Ford look are you busyAm I busy exclaimed Arthur Well Ive  just  got  all  thesebulldozers and things to lie in front of because theyll knock myhouse down if I dont but other  than  that    well  no  notespecially whyThey dont have sarcasm on Betelgeuse  and  Ford  Prefect  oftenfailed  to notice it unless he was concentrating He said Goodis there anywhere we can talkWhat said Arthur DentFor a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him and  stared  fixedlyinto  the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car Thensuddenly he squatted down beside ArthurWeve got to talk he said urgentlyFine said Arthur talkAnd drink said Ford Its vitally important that we talk  anddrink Now Well go to the pub in the villageHe looked into the sky again nervous expectantLook dont you  understand  shouted  Arthur  He  pointed  atProsser That man wants to knock my house downFord glanced at him puzzledWell he can do it while youre away cant he he askedBut I dont want him toAhLook whats the matter with you Ford said ArthurNothing Nothings the matter Listen to me  Ive got  to  tellyou  the most important thing youve ever heard Ive got to tellyou now and Ive got to tell you in the saloon bar of the  Horseand GroomBut whyBecause you are going to need a very stiff drinkFord stared at Arthur and Arthur was astonished to find that hiswill  was  beginning  to  weaken He didnt realize that this wasbecause of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in  thehyperspace  ports  that  served the madranite mining belts in thestar system of Orion BetaThe game was not unlike the Earth game called  Indian  Wrestlingand was played like thisTwo contestants would sit either side of a table with a glass infront of each of themBetween them  would  be  placed  a  bottle  of  Janx  Spirit  asimmortalized  in that ancient Orion mining song Oh dont give menone more of that Old Janx Spirit No dont  you  give  me  nonemore  of  that  Old  Janx Spirit For my head will fly my tonguewill lie my eyes will fry and I may die Wont you pour  me  onemore of that sinful Old Janx SpiritEach of the two contestants would then concentrate their will  onthe  bottle  and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glassof his opponent  who would then have to drink itThe bottle would then be  refilled  The  game  would  be  playedagain And againOnce you started to lose you would probably keep losing  becauseone  of  the  effects  of  Janx  spirit is to depress telepsychicpowerAs soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed the  finalloser  would  have  to  perform  a  forfeit  which  was  usuallyobscenely biologicalFord Prefect usually played to loseFord stared at Arthur who began to think  that  perhaps  he  didwant to go to the Horse and Groom after allBut what about my house  he asked plaintivelyFord looked across to Mr Prosser and suddenly a  wicked  thoughtstruck himHe wants to knock your house downYes he wants to build And he cant because youre lying in front of the bulldozersYes and Im sure we can come to some arrangement  said  Ford  Excuseme he shoutedMr Prosser who was arguing with a spokesman  for  the  bulldozerdrivers  about  whether  or  not Arthur Dent constituted a mentalhealth hazard and how much they  should  get  paid  if  he  didlooked around He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find thatArthur had companyYes Hello he called Has Mr Dent come to his senses yetCan we for the moment called Ford assume that he hasntWell sighed Mr ProsserAnd can we also assume said  Ford  that  hes  going  to  bestaying here all daySoSo all your men are going to be standing around  all  day  doingnothingCould be could be Well if  youre  resigned  to  doing  that  anyway  you  dontactually need him to lie here all the time do youWhatYou dont said Ford patiently actually need him hereMr Prosser thought about thisWell no not as  such  he  said  not  exactly  need  Prosser  was worried He thought that one of them wasnt making alot of senseFord said So if you would just like to take  it  as  read  thathes  actually here then he and I could slip off down to the pubfor half an hour How does that soundMr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly pottyThat sounds perfectly reasonable he said in a reassuring  toneof voice wondering who he was trying to reassureAnd if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself  later  onsaid Ford we can always cover up for you in returnThank you very much said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how  toplay  this  at  all  thank you very much yes thats very kind He frowned then smiled then tried  to  do  both  at  oncefailed  grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully roundthe top of his head He could only assume that he had just wonSo continued Ford Prefect if you would  just  like  to  comeover here and lie down What said Mr ProsserAh Im sorry said Ford perhaps I hadnt made  myself  fullyclear  Somebodys  got to lie in front of the bulldozers haventthey Or there wont be anything to stop  them  driving  into  MrDents house will thereWhat said Mr Prosser againIts very simple said Ford my client Mr Dent says that  hewill  stop  lying  here in the mud on the sole condition that youcome and take over from himWhat are you talking about said Arthur but  Ford  nudged  himwith his shoe to be quietYou want me said Mr Prosser spelling out this new thought  tohimself to come and lie there YesIn front of the bulldozerYesInstead of Mr DentYesIn the mudIn as you say it the mudAs soon as Mr Prosser realized  that  he  was  substantially  theloser  after  all  it  was  as if a weight lifted itself off hisshoulders this was more like the world as he knew it He sighedIn return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down  to  thepubThats it said Ford Thats it exactlyMr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stoppedPromisePromise said Ford He turned to ArthurCome on he said to him get up and let the man lie downArthur stood up feeling as if he was in a dreamFord beckoned to Prosser who sadly awkwardly sat  down  in  themud  He  felt  that his whole life was some kind of dream and hesometimes wondered whose it was and whether  they  were  enjoyingit The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozedinto his shoesFord looked at him severelyAnd no sneaky knocking down Mr Dents house  whilst  hes  awayalright he saidThe mere thought growled Mr Prosser  hadnt  even  begun  tospeculate  he  continued  settling  himself  back  about themerest possibility of crossing my mindHe saw the bulldozer drivers  union  representative  approachingand  let his head sink back and closed his eyes He was trying tomarshal his arguments for proving that he did not now  constitutea  mental  health  hazard  himself He was far from certain aboutthis  his mind seemed to be full of noise  horses  smoke  andthe  stench of blood This always happened when he felt miserableand put upon and he  had  never  been  able  to  explain  it  tohimself  In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mightyKhan bellowed with rage but Mr Prosser  only  trembled  slightlyand whimpered He began to fell little pricks of water behind theeyelids Bureaucratic cockups  angry  men  lying  in  the  mudindecipherable  strangers  handing  out inexplicable humiliationsand an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his  head what a dayWhat a day Ford Prefect knew that it didnt  matter  a  pair  ofdingos  kidneys  whether  Arthurs house got knocked down or notnowArthur remained very worriedBut can we trust him he saidMyself Id trust him to the end of the Earth said FordOh yes said Arthur and how fars thatAbout twelve minutes away  said  Ford  come  on  I  need  adrinkHeres what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about  alcoholIt  says  that  alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed bythe fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effecton certain carbonbased life formsThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy also mentions  alcohol  Itsays  that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic GargleBlasterIt says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is  likehaving  your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped rounda large gold brickThe Guide also tells you on which planets the best  Pan

Groom And quickly please the worlds about to endThe barman of the Horse and Groom didnt  deserve  this  sort  oftreatment  he  was a dignified old man He pushed his glasses uphis nose and blinked at Ford Prefect Ford ignored him and staredout  of  the  window  so the barman looked instead at Arthur whoshrugged helplessly and said nothingSo the barman said Oh  yes  sir  Nice  weather  for  it  andstarted pulling pintsHe tried againGoing to watch the match this afternoon thenFord glanced round at himNo no point he said and looked back out of the windowWhats that foregone conclusion then you reckon sir said  thebarman Arsenal without a chanceNo no said Ford its just that the worlds about to endOh yes sir so you said said  the  barman  looking  over  hisglasses  this  time  at  Arthur  Lucky escape for Arsenal if itdidFord looked back at him genuinely surprisedNo not really he said He frownedThe barman breathed in heavily There you are sir  six  pintshe saidArthur smiled at him wanly and  shrugged  again  He  turned  andsmiled  wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them hadheard what was going onNone of them had and none of them could understand what  he  wassmiling at them forA man sitting next to Ford at the bar  looked  at  the  two  menlooked  at the six pints did a swift burst of mental arithmeticarrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid  hopeful  grinat themGet off said Ford Theyre ours  giving  him  a  look  thatwould have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doingFord slapped a fivepound note on the bar  He  said  Keep  thechangeWhat from a fiver Thank you sirYouve got ten minutes left to spend itThe barman simply decided to walk away for a bitFord said Arthur would you please tell me what the  hell  isgoing onDrink up said Ford youve got three pints to get throughThree pints said Arthur At lunchtimeThe man next to ford grinned and  nodded  happily  Ford  ignoredhim He said Time is an illusion Lunchtime doubly soVery deep said  Arthur  you  should  send  that  in  to  theReaders Digest Theyve got a page for people like youDrink upWhy three pints all of a suddenMuscle relaxant youll need itMuscle relaxantMuscle relaxantArthur stared into his beerDid I do anything wrong today  he  said  or  has  the  worldalways  been  like this and Ive been too wrapped up in myself tonoticeAlright said Ford Ill try to  explain  How  long  have  weknown each otherHow long Arthur thought Er about five years maybe six hesaid Most of it seemed to make some sense at the timeAlright said Ford How would you react if I said that Im notfrom  Guildford  after  all but from a small planet somewhere inthe vicinity of BetelgeuseArthur shrugged in a soso sort of wayI dont know he said taking a pull of beer  Why    do  youthink its the sort of thing youre likely to sayFord gave up It really wasnt worth  bothering  at  the  momentwhat with the world being about to end He just saidDrink upHe added perfectly factuallyThe worlds about to endArthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile  The  rest  ofthe  pub  frowned  at  him A man waved at him to stop smiling atthem and mind his own businessThis must be Thursday said Arthur musing to  himself  sinkinglow over his beer I never could get the hang of ThursdaysOn this particular Thursday something was moving quietly throughthe  ionosphere  many  miles  above  the  surface  of the planetseveral somethings in fact  several  dozen  huge  yellow  chunkyslablike  somethings  huge as office buildings silent as birdsThey soared with ease basking in electromagnetic rays  from  thestar Sol biding their time grouping preparingThe planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious  of  theirpresence  which  was just how they wanted it for the moment Thehuge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly  they  passedover  Cape  Canaveral  without  a  blip Woomera and Jodrell Banklooked straight through them  which was a pity  because  it  wasexactly  the  sort  of  thing  theyd  been looking for all theseyearsThe only place they registered at all was on a small black devicecalled  a  SubEtha  SensOMatic  which  winked  away quietly toitself It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel whichFord Prefect wore habitually round his neck The contents of FordPrefects satchel were quite interesting in fact and  would  havemade any Earth physicists eyes pop out of his head which is whyhe always concealed them by keeping a couple of dogeared scriptsfor plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the topBesides the SubEtha SensOMatic  and  the  scripts  he  had  anElectronic  Thumb  a short squat black rod smooth and matt witha couple of flat switches and dials at one end  he  also  had  adevice  which looked rather like a largish electronic calculatorThis had about a hundred tiny flat press  buttons  and  a  screenabout  four  inches  square on which any one of a million pagescould be summoned  at  a  moments  notice  It  looked  insanelycomplicated and this was one of the reasons why the snug plasticcover it fitted into had the words Dont Panic printed on  it  inlarge friendly letters The other reason was that this device wasin fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of thegreat  publishing  corporations of Ursa Minor  The Hitch HikersGuide to the Galaxy The reason why it was published in the  formof  a  micro  sub  meson  electronic component is that if it wereprinted in normal book form an interstellar  hitch  hiker  wouldrequire several inconveniently large buildings to carry it aroundinBeneath that in Ford  Prefects  satchel  were  a  few  biros  anotepad and a largish bath towel from Marks and SpencerThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say  onthe subject of towelsA towel it says is about the most  massively  useful  thing  aninterstellar  hitch hiker can have Partly it has great practicalvalue  you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound acrossthe cold moons of Jaglan Beta you can lie on it on the brilliantmarblesanded beaches of Santraginus V inhaling  the  heady  seavapours  you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine soredly on the desert world of Kakrafoon use it  to  sail  a  miniraft  down  the slow heavy river Moth wet it for use in handtohandcombat wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes orto  avoid  the  gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal amindboggingly stupid animal it assumes that if you cant see itit  cant  see  you  daft as a bush but very ravenous you canwave your towel in emergencies  as  a  distress  signal  and  ofcourse  dry  yourself  off  with it if it still seems to be cleanenoughMore importantly a towel has immense  psychological  value  Forsome reason if a strag strag nonhitch hiker discovers that ahitch hiker has his towel with him he will automatically  assumethat  he  is  also  in  possession of a toothbrush face flannelsoap tin of biscuits flask compass map ball of string  gnatspray  wet  weather gear space suit etc etc Furthermore thestrag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of  these  or  adozen  other  items  that the hitch hiker might accidentally havelost What the strag will think is that any man who  can  hitchthe length and breadth of the galaxy rough it slum it struggleagainst terrible odds win through and  still  knows  where  histowel is is clearly a man to be reckoned withHence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking  slang  as  inHey  you  sass  that  hoopy  Ford  Prefect Theres a frood whoreally knows where his towel is Sass know be aware of meethave   sex  with  hoopy  really  together  guy  frood  reallyamazingly together guyNestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford  Prefects  satchelthe SubEtha SensOMatic began to wink more quickly Miles abovethe surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fanout  At  Jodrell  Bank  someone  decided it was time for a nicerelaxing cup of teaYou got a towel with you said Ford Prefect suddenly to ArthurArthur struggling through his third pint looked round at himWhy What no    should  I  have  He  had  given  up  beingsurprised there didnt seem to be any point any longerFord clicked his tongue in irritationDrink up he urgedAt that moment the dull sound of a rumbling  crash  from  outsidefiltered  through the low murmur of the pub through the sound ofthe jukebox through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccuppingover the whisky Ford had eventually bought himArthur choked on his beer leapt to his feetWhats that he yelpedDont worry said Ford they havent started yetThank God for that said Arthur and relaxedIts probably just your house being knocked  down  said  Forddrowning his last pintWhat shouted Arthur Suddenly Fords spell was broken  Arthurlooked wildly around him and ran to the windowMy God they are Theyre knocking my house down What  the  hellam I doing in the pub FordIt hardly makes any difference at this stage said  Ford  letthem have their funFun yelped Arthur Fun He quickly checked out of the windowagain that they were talking about the same thingDamn their fun he hooted and ran  out  of  the  pub  furiouslywaving  a  nearly  empty beer glass He made no friends at all inthe pub that lunchtimeStop you vandals You home wreckers bawled Arthur You  halfcrazed Visigoths stop will youFord would have to go after him Turning quickly to the barman heasked for four packets of peanutsThere you are sir said the barman slapping the packets on thebar twentyeight pence if youd be so kindFord was very kind  he gave the barman another  fivepound  noteand told him to keep the change The barman looked at it and thenlooked at Ford He suddenly shivered he experienced a  momentarysensation  that  he didnt understand because no one on Earth hadever experienced it before In moments  of  great  stress  everylife  form  that  exists  gives  out a tiny sublimal signal Thissignal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense  ofhow far that being is from the place of his birth On Earth it isnever possible to be further than  sixteen  thousand  miles  fromyour birthplace which really isnt very far so such signals aretoo minute to be noticed Ford Prefect was at this  moment  undergreat  stress  and  he was born  light years away in the nearvicinity of BetelgeuseThe  barman  reeled  for   a   moment   hit   by   a   shockingincomprehensible sense of distance He didnt know what it meantbut he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect almostaweAre you serious sir he said in a small whisper which had  theeffect  of  silencing  the  pub  You think the worlds going toendYes said FordBut this afternoonFord had recovered himself He was at his flippestYes  he  said  gaily  in  less  than  two  minutes  I  wouldestimateThe barman couldnt believe the conversation he was  having  buthe couldnt believe the sensation he had just had eitherIsnt there anything we can do about it then he saidNo nothing said Ford stuffing the peanuts into his pocketsSomeone in the hushed  bar  suddenly  laughed  raucously  at  howstupid everyone had becomeThe man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now  His  eyeswaved their way up to FordI thought he said that if the world was going to end we weremeant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or somethingIf you like yes said FordThats what they told us in the army said  the  man  and  hiseyes began the long trek back down to his whiskyWill that help asked the barmanNo said Ford and gave him a friendly smile  Excuse  me  hesaid Ive got to go With a wave he leftThe pub was silent for a moment longer and then  embarrassinglyenough  the man with the raucous laugh did it again The girl hehad dragged along to the pub with him had  grown  to  loathe  himdearly  over the last hour or so and it would probably have beena great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and  a  halfor so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen ozoneand carbon monoxide However when the moment came she  would  betoo busy evaporating herself to notice itThe barman cleared his throat He heard himself sayLast orders pleaseThe huge yellow machines began  to  sink  downward  and  to  movefasterFord knew they were there This wasnt the way he had wanted itRunning up the lane Arthur had  nearly  reached  his  house  Hedidnt  notice  how cold it had suddenly become he didnt noticethe wind he didnt notice the sudden irrational squall of  rainHe didnt notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawlingover the rubble that had been his homeYou barbarians he yelled Ill  sue  the  council  for  everypenny  its  got  Ill  have  you hung drawn and quartered Andwhipped And boiled  until   until    until  youve  hadenoughFord was running after him very fast Very very fastAnd then Ill do  it  again  yelled  Arthur  And  when  Ivefinished  I  will  take  all  the little bits and I will jump onthemArthur  didnt  notice  that  the  men  were  running  from   thebulldozers   he  didnt  notice  that  Mr  Prosser  was  staringhectically into the sky What Mr Prosser  had  noticed  was  thathuge   yellow  somethings  were  screaming  through  the  cloudsImpossibly huge yellow somethingsAnd I will carry on  jumping  on  them  yelled  Arthur  stillrunning  until  I get blisters or I can think of anything evenmore unpleasant to do and then Arthur tripped and fell headlong rolled and landed flat on  hisback  At last he noticed that something was going on His fingershot upwardsWhat the hells that he shriekedWhatever it was raced across the  sky  in  monstrous  yellownesstore  the  sky apart with mindbuggering noise and leapt off intothe distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bangthat drove your ears six feet into your skullAnother one followed and did the same thing only louderIts difficult to say exactly what the people on the  surface  ofthe  planet  were doing now because they didnt really know whatthey were doing themselves None of it made  a  lot  of  sense  running  into  houses running out of houses howling noiselesslyat the noise All around the world  city  streets  exploded  withpeople cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them andthen rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys desertsand oceans seeming to flatten everything it hitOnly one man stood and  watched  the  sky  stood  with  terriblesadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears He knew exactlywhat was happening and had known ever since his SubEtha  SensOMatic  had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillarand woken him with a start It was what he  had  waited  for  allthese  years  but  when  he  had  deciphered  the signal patternsitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had  gripped  himand squeezed his heart Of all the races in all of the Galaxy whocould have come and said a big hello to planet Earth he thoughtdidnt it just have to be the VogonsStill he knew what he had to do  As  the  Vogon  craft  screamedthrough  the  air  high above him he opened his satchel He threwaway a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor  Dreamcoat  hethrew away a copy of Godspell He wouldnt need them where he wasgoing Everything was ready everything was preparedHe knew where his towel wasA sudden silence hit the Earth If anything it was worse than thenoise For a while nothing happenedThe great ships hung motionless in the air over every nation  onEarth  Motionless  they  hung huge heavy steady in the sky ablasphemy against nature Many people went straight into shock astheir  minds  tried  to  encompass what they were looking at Theships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks dontAnd still nothing happenedThen there was a slight whisper a  sudden  spacious  whisper  ofopen  ambient  sound  Every hi fi set in the world every radioevery television every cassette recorder  every  woofer  everytweeter  every  midrange  driver  in  the  world quietly turneditself onEvery tin can every dust bin every  window  every  car  everywine  glass  every  sheet  of rusty metal became activated as anacoustically perfect sounding boardBefore the Earth passed away it was going to be  treated  to  thevery  ultimate in sound reproduction the greatest public addresssystem ever built  But  there  was  no  concert  no  music  nofanfare just a simple messagePeople of Earth your attention please a voice  said  and  itwas   wonderful   Wonderful   perfect  quadrophonic  sound  withdistortion levels so low as to make a brave man weepThis is  Prostetnic  Vogon  Jeltz  of  the  Galactic  HyperspacePlanning  Council the voice continued As you will no doubt beaware the plans for development of the outlying regions  of  theGalaxy  require  the  building  of  a  hyperspatial express routethrough your star system and regrettably your planet is  one  ofthose  scheduled  for  demolition The process will take slightlyless that two of your Earth minutes Thank youThe PA died awayUncomprehending terror settled on the watching people  of  EarthThe  terror  moved  slowly through the gathered crowds as if theywere iron fillings on a sheet of board and a  magnet  was  movingbeneath  them Panic sprouted again desperate fleeing panic butthere was nowhere to flee toObserving this the Vogons turned on their PA again It saidTheres no point in acting  all  surprised  about  it  All  theplanning  charts  and  demolition  orders have been on display inyour local planning department on Alpha  Centauri  for  fifty  ofyour  Earth  years  so  youve  had  plenty of time to lodge anyformal complaint and its far too late to  start  making  a  fussabout it nowThe PA fell silent again and its  echo  drifted  off  across  theland The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power Onthe underside of each a hatchway opened an empty black spaceBy  this  time  somebody  somewhere  must  have  manned  a  radiotransmitter  located a wavelength and broadcasted a message backto the Vogon ships to plead on behalf of the planet Nobody everheard  what  they said they only heard the reply The PA slammedback into life again The voice was annoyed It saidWhat do you mean  youve  never  been  to  Alpha  Centauri  Forheavens  sake mankind its only four light years away you knowIm sorry but if you cant be bothered to take  an  interest  inlocal affairs thats your own lookoutEnergize the demolition beamsLight poured out into the hatchwaysI dont know said the  voice  on  the  PA  apathetic  bloodyplanet Ive no sympathy at all It cut offThere was a terrible ghastly silenceThere was a terrible ghastly noiseThere was a terrible ghastly silenceThe Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away  into  the  inky  starryvoidFar away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy  five  hundredthousand  light  years  from  the  star  Sol  Zaphod BeeblebroxPresident of the Imperial Galactic Government  sped  across  theseas  of  Damogran his ion drive delta boat winking and flashingin the Damogran sunDamogran the  hot  Damogran  the  remote  Damogran  the  almosttotally unheard ofDamogran secret home of the Heart of GoldThe boat sped on across the water It would be some  time  beforeit   reached   its   destination  because  Damogran  is  such  aninconveniently  arranged  planet  It  consists  of  nothing  butmiddling  to  large  desert  islands separated by very pretty butannoyingly wide stretches of oceanThe boat sped onBecause of  this  topological  awkwardness  Damogran  has  alwaysremained  a  deserted  planet  This is why the Imperial GalacticGovernment chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project  becauseit was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secretThe boat zipped and skipped across the  sea  the  sea  that  laybetween  the  main  islands of the only archipelago of any usefulsize on the whole planet Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his  way  fromthe  tiny  spaceport  on  Easter Island the name was an entirelymeaningless coincidence  in Galacticspeke  easter  means  smallflat  and  light  brown  to  the  Heart of Gold island which byanother meaningless coincidence was called FranceOne of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a  wholestring of pretty meaningless coincidencesBut it was not in any way a coincidence that today  the  day  ofculmination  of  the project the great day of unveiling the daythat the Heart  of  Gold  was  finally  to  be  introduced  to  amarvelling Galaxy was also a great day of culmination for ZaphodBeeblebrox It was for the sake of this day  that  he  had  firstdecided  to  run  for  the  Presidency a decision which had sentwaves of astonishment throughout the  Imperial  Galaxy    ZaphodBeeblebrox   President  Not  the  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  Not  thePresident Many had seen it as a clinching proof that  the  wholeof known creation had finally gone bananasZaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speedZaphod Beeblebrox  adventurer  exhippy  good  timer  crookquite  possibly  manic selfpublicist terribly bad at personalrelationships often thought to be completely out to lunchPresidentNo one had gone bananas not in that way at leastOnly six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle  onwhich  the  Galaxy  was  governed and they knew that once ZaphodBeeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it wasmore  or  less  a  fait  accompli  he  was  the ideal PresidencyfodderWhat they completely failed to  understand  was  why  Zaphod  wasdoing itHe banked sharply shooting a wild wall of water at the sunToday was the day today was the day when they would realize whatZaphod  had  been  up  to  Today  was  what  Zaphod BeeblebroxsPresidency was all  about  Today  was  also  his  two  hundredthbirthday but that was just another meaningless coincidenceAs he skipped his boat across the  seas  of  Damogran  he  smiledquietly  to  himself  about  what a wonderful exciting day it wasgoing to be He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across theseat back He steered with an extra arm hed recently fitted justbeneath his right one to help improve his skiboxingHey he cooed to himself youre a real cool boy you But hisnerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistleThe island of France was about  twenty  miles  long  five  milesacross  the  middle sandy and crescent shaped In fact it seemedto exist not so much as an island in its own right  as  simply  ameans  of  defining  the  sweep  and  curve  of  a huge bay Thisimpression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline ofthe  crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs From thetop of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five  miles  to  theopposite shoreOn top of the cliffs stood a reception committeeIt consisted in large part of the engineers and  researchers  whohad built the Heart of Gold  mostly humanoid but here and therewere a few reptiloid atomineers two or  three  green  slyphlikemaximegalacticans  an  octopoid  physucturalist  or  two  and  aHooloovoo a Hooloovoo is a superintelligent shade of the  colorblue  All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multicolored ceremonial lab coats the Hooloovoo had been  temporarilyrefracted into a free standing prism for the occasionThere was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through  all  ofthem  Together  and between them they had gone to and beyond thefurthest limits of physical laws  restructured  the  fundamentalfabric  of  matter  strained  twisted  and  broken  the laws ofpossibility and impossibility but still the greatest  excitementof  all  seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round hisneck An orange sash  was  what  the  President  of  the  Galaxytraditionally  wore It might not even have made much differenceto them if theyd known exactly how much power the  President  ofthe  Galaxy actually wielded none at all Only six people in theGalaxy knew that the job of the Galactic  President  was  not  towield power but to attract attention away from itZaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his jobThe  crowd  gasped  dazzled  by  sun  and  seemanship  as   thePresidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay Itflashed and shone as  it  came  skating  over  the  sea  in  wideskidding turnsIn fact it didnt need to touch the water at all because it  wassupported  on  a  hazy  cushion  of  ionized atoms  but just foreffect it was fitted with thin finblades which could  be  loweredinto  the  water  They  slashed sheets of water hissing into theair carved deep gashes into the sea  which  swayed  crazily  andsank  back foaming into the boats wake as it careered across thebayZaphod loved effect it was what he was best atHe twisted the wheel sharply the boat slewed  round  in  a  wildscything  skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightlyon the rocking wavesWithin seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned  atover  three  billion  people  The  three  billion people werentactually there but they watched his every  gesture  through  theeyes  of a small robot triD camera which hovered obsequiously inthe air nearby The antics of the President always made amazinglypopular triD thats what they were forHe grinned again Three billion and six people  didnt  know  itbut today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained forThe robot camera homed in for a close up on the more  popular  ofhis  two  heads  and  he  waved again He was roughly humanoid inappearance except for the extra head  and  third  arm  His  fairtousled  hair  stuck  out  in  random  directions  his blue eyesglinted with something completely unidentifiable and  his  chinswere almost always unshavenA twentyfoothigh transparent globe floated next  to  his  boatrolling  and  bobbing glistening in the brilliant sun Inside itfloated a wide semicircular sofa  upholstered  in  glorious  redleather  the more the globe bobbed and rolled the more the sofastayed perfectly still steady as an upholstered rock Again alldone for effect as much as anythingZaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed  on  thesofa  He  spread his two arms lazily along the back and with thethird brushed some dust off his knee  His  heads  looked  aboutsmiling  he put his feet up At any moment he thought he mightscreamWater boiled up beneath the bubble it seethed and  spouted  Thebubble  surged  into  the  air  bobbing and rolling on the waterspout Up up it climbed throwing stilts of light at the  cliffUp  it  surged  on  the  jet  the water falling from beneath itcrashing back into the sea hundreds of feet belowZaphod smiled picturing himselfA thoroughly ridiculous  form  of  transport  but  a  thoroughlybeautiful oneAt the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment tipped onto  a railed ramp rolled down it to a small concave platform andriddled to a haltTo tremendous applause  Zaphod  Beeblebrox  stepped  out  of  thebubble his orange sash blazing in the lightThe President of the Galaxy had arrivedHe waited for the applause to die down then raised his hands  ingreetingHi he saidA government spider sidled up to him and  attempted  to  press  acopy  of his prepared speech into his hands Pages three to sevenof the original version were at the moment  floating  soggily  onthe  Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay Pages one andtwo had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle  and  hadalready  become  incorporated  into  an extraordinary new form ofnest which the eagle had invented It was constructed largely  ofpapier  mch and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatchedbaby eagle to break out of it The Damogran Frond  Crested  Eaglehad  heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted notruck with itZaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing  his  set  speech  and  hegently deflected the one being offered him by the spiderHi he said againEveryone beamed at him or at least nearly everyone He singledout  Trillian from the crowd Trillian was a gird that Zaphod hadpicked up recently  whilst  visiting  a  planet  just  for  funincognito  She  was  slim darkish humanoid with long waves ofblack hair a full mouth  an  odd  little  nob  of  a  nose  andridiculously  brown eyes With her red head scarf knotted in thatparticular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she  lookedvaguely  Arabic  Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arabof course The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist and  evenwhen they had existed they were five hundred thousand light yearsfrom Damogran Trillian  wasnt  anybody  in  particular  or  soZaphod  claimed  She  just went around with him rather a lot andtold him what she thought of himHi honey he said to herShe flashed him a quick tight smile and  looked  away  Then  shelooked  back  for  a  moment and smiled more warmly  but by thistime he was looking at something elseHi he said to a small knot of creatures  from  the  press  whowere standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and geton with the quotes He grinned at them  particularly  because  heknew  that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of aquoteThe next thing he said though was not a lot of use to  them  Oneof  the  officials  of  the  party had irritably decided that thePresident was clearly not in  a  mood  to  read  the  deliciouslyturned  speech that had been written for him and had flipped theswitch on the remote control device in his pocket Away in  frontof  them  a  huge  white dome that bulged against the sky crackeddown in the middle split and slowly folded itself down into theground Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well itwas going to do that because they had built it that wayBeneath it lay uncovered a huge starship one hundred  and  fiftymetres  long  shaped  like a sleek running shoe perfectly whiteand mindboggingly beautiful At the heart of it  unseen  lay  asmall  gold  box which carried within it the most brainwretchingdevice ever conceived a device which made this  starship  uniquein  the  history of the galaxy a device after which the ship hadbeen named  The Heart of GoldWow said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold There  wasntmuch else he could sayHe said it again because he knew it would annoy the pressWowThe crowd turned their faces back  towards  him  expectantly  Hewinked  at  Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyesat him She knew what he was about  to  say  and  thought  him  aterrible showoffThat is really amazing he said That really is truly amazingThat is so amazingly amazing I think Id like to steal itA marvellous Presidential quote absolutely  true  to  form  Thecrowd  laughed  appreciatively  the  newsmen  gleefully  punchedbuttons on their SubEtha NewsMatics and the President grinnedAs he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he  fingered  thesmall ParalysoMatic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocketFinally he could bear it no more He lifted his heads up  to  thesky  let out a wild whoop in major thirds threw the bomb to theground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smilesProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight even  for  otherVogons  His  highly  domed  nose  rose  high above a small piggyforehead His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him toplay  the game of Vogon Civil Service politics and play it welland waterproof enough for him  to  survive  indefinitely  at  seadepths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effectsNot that he ever went swimming of course His busy schedule wouldnot allow it He was the way he was because billions of years agowhen the Vogons had first crawled out of  the  sluggish  primevalseas  of  Vogsphere  and  had  lain  panting  and heaving on theplanets virgin shores when the first rays of the bright youngVogsol  sun  had shone across them that morning it was as if theforces of evolution ad simply given up on them  there  and  thenhad  turned  aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly andunfortunate mistake They never evolved again they should  neverhave survivedThe fact that they did is some kind  of  tribute  to  the  thickwilled  slugbrained  stubbornness of these creatures Evolutionthey said to themselves Who needs it and what  nature  refusedto  do  for  them they simply did without until such time as theywere able to rectify the grosser anatomical  inconveniences  withsurgeryMeanwhile the natural forces on the planet  Vogsphere  had  beenworking  overtime  to  make  up  for  their earlier blunder Theybrought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs  which  theVogons  ate  smashing  their  shells  with  iron  mallets  tallaspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which theVogons  cut  down and burned the crab meat with elegant gazellelike creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which  the  Vogonswould  catch  and  sit  on They were no use as transport becausetheir backs would snap instantly but  the  Vogons  sat  on  themanywayThus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia untilthe  Vogons  suddenly  discovered  the principles of interstellartravel Within a  few  short  Vog  years  every  last  Vogon  hadmigrated  to  the  Megabrantis  cluster the political hub of theGalaxy and now formed the  immensely  powerful  backbone  of  theGalactic  Civil Service They have attempted to acquire learningthey have attempted to acquire style and  social  grace  but  inmost  respects  the  modern  Vogon  is  little different from hisprimitive forebears Every year they import twentyseven thousandscintillating  jewelled  scuttling crabs from their native planetand while away a happy drunken night smashing them to  bits  withiron malletsProstetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he  wasthoroughly vile Also he did not like hitch hikersSomewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines  ofProstetnic   Vogon   Jeltzs   flagship  a  small  match  flarednervously The owner of the match was not a Vogon  but  he  knewall  about  them  and  was right to be nervous His name was FordPrefectHe looked about the cabin but  could  see  very  little  strangemonstrous  shadows  loomed  and  leaped  with the tiny flickeringflame but all was quiet He breathed a silent thank you  to  theDentrassis  The  Dentrassis  are an unruly tribe of gourmands awild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons  had  recently  taken  toemploying  as  catering  staff  on their long haul fleets on thestrict understanding that  they  keep  themselves  very  much  tothemselvesThis suited the Dentrassis fine because they loved Vogon  moneywhich  is one of the hardest currencies in space but loathed theVogons themselves The only sort of Vogon a  Dentrassi  liked  tosee was an annoyed VogonIt was because of  this  tiny  piece  of  information  that  FordPrefect  was  not  now  a  whiff  of  hydrogen  ozone and carbonmonoxideHe heard a slight groan By the light of the match he saw a heavyshape  moving  slightly  on the floor Quickly he shook the matchout reached in his pocket found what he  was  looking  for  andtook it out He crouched on the floor The shape moved againFord Prefect said I bought some peanutsArthur Dent moved and groaned again muttering incoherentlyHere have some urged Ford  shaking  the  packet  again  ifyouve  never  been  through  a  matter  transference beam beforeyouve probably lost some salt and  protein  The  beer  you  hadshould have cushioned your system a bitWhhhrrrr said Arthur Dent He opened his eyesIts dark he saidYes said Ford Prefect its darkNo light said Arthur Dent Dark no lightOne of the things  Ford  Prefect  had  always  found  hardest  tounderstand  about  human  beings  was  their habit of continuallystating and repeating the obvious as in  Its  a  nice  day  orYoure  very  tall  or  Oh  dear  you seem to have fallen down athirtyfoot well are you alright At first  Ford  had  formed  atheory  to  account  for  this strange behaviour If human beingsdont keep  exercising  their  lips  he  thought  their  mouthsprobably   seize  up  After  a  few  months  consideration  andobservation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new  one  Ifthey  dont  keep  on  exercising  their  lips he thought theirbrains start working After a while he abandoned this one as wellas  being  obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked humanbeings after all but  he  always  remained  desperately  worriedabout the terrible number of things they didnt know aboutYes he agreed with Arthur no light  He  helped  Arthur  tosome peanuts How do you feel he askedLike a military academy said  Arthur  bits  of  me  keep  onpassing outFord stared at him blankly in the darknessIf I asked you where the hell  we  were  said  Arthur  weaklywould I regret itFord stood up Were safe he saidOh good said ArthurWere in a small galley  cabin  said  Ford  in  one  of  thespaceships of the Vogon Constructor FleetAh said Arthur this is obviously some strange usage  of  theword safe that I wasnt previously aware ofFord struck another match to help him search for a light  switchMonstrous  shadows  leaped  and loomed again Arthur struggled tohis feet and hugged himself apprehensively Hideous alien  shapesseemed  to  throng about him the air was thick with musty smellswhich sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves and alow irritating hum kept his brain from focusingHow did we get here he asked shivering slightlyWe hitched a lift said FordExcuse me said Arthur Are you trying to tell me that we juststuck  out  our  thumbs and some green bugeyed monster stuck hishead out and said Hi fellas hop right in I can take you as faras the Basingstoke roundaboutWell said Ford the Thumbs an electronic subetha signallingdevice  the roundabouts at Barnards Star six light years awaybut otherwise thats more or less rightAnd the bugeyed monsterIs green yesFine said Arthur when can I get homeYou cant said Ford Prefect and found the light switchShade your eyes  he said and turned it onEven Ford was surprisedGood grief said Arthur is this  really  the  interior  of  aflying saucerProstetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round thecontrol   bridge   He   always   felt  vaguely  irritable  afterdemolishing populated planets He wished that someone would  comeand tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at themand feel better He flopped as heavily as  he  could  on  to  hiscontrol  seat  in  the  hope  that  it  would  break and give himsomething to be  genuinely  angry  about  but  it  only  gave  acomplaining sort of creakGo away he shouted at a young  Vogon  guard  who  entered  thebridge  at  that  moment The guard vanished immediately feelingrather relieved He was glad it wouldnt now be him who deliveredthe  report  theyd  just  received  The  report was an officialrelease which said that a wonderful new form of  spaceship  drivewas  at  this moment being unveiled at a government research baseon Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial  expressroutes unnecessaryAnother door slid open but this time the  Vogon  captain  didntshout  because it was the door from the galley quarters where theDentrassis prepared his meals A meal would be most welcomeA huge furry creature bounded through the  door  with  his  lunchtray It was grinning like a maniacProstetnic Vogon  Jeltz  was  delighted  He  knew  that  when  aDentrassi  looked  that  pleased  with itself there was somethinggoing on somewhere on the ship  that  he  could  get  very  angryindeed aboutFord and Arthur stared about themWell what do you think said FordIts a bit squalid isnt itFord  frowned  at  the  grubby  mattress   unwashed   cups   andunidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around thecramped cabinWell this is a working ship you see said  Ford  These  arethe Dentrassi sleeping quartersI thought you said they were called Vogons or somethingYes said Ford the Vogons run the ship  the  Dentrassis  arethe cooks they let us on boardIm confused said ArthurHere have a look at this said Ford He sat down on one of themattresses  and rummaged about in his satchel Arthur prodded themattress nervously and then sat on it himself  in  fact  he  hadvery  little to be nervous about because all mattresses grown inthe swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed  anddried  before  being  put  to service Very few have ever come tolife againFord handed the book to ArthurWhat is it asked ArthurThe Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Its a sort of  electronicbook  It  tells  you everything you need to know about anythingThats its jobArthur turned it over nervously in his handsI like the cover he said Dont Panic Its the first helpfulor intelligible thing anybodys said to me all dayIll show you how it works said  Ford  He  snatched  it  fromArthur who was still holding it as if it was a twoweekdead larkand pulled it out of its coverYou press this button here you see  and  the  screen  lights  upgiving you the indexA screen about three inches by four lit up and characters beganto flicker across the surfaceYou want to know about Vogons so I enter  that  name  so  Hisfingers tapped some more keys And there we areThe words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared  in  green  across  thescreenFord pressed a large red button at the bottom of the  screen  andwords  began  to  undulate  across it At the same time the bookbegan to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voiceThis is what the book saidVogon Constructor Fleets Here is what to do if you want to  geta  lift  from  a  Vogon  forget  it  They  are  one of the mostunpleasant races in the Galaxy   not  actually  evil  but  badtempered bureaucratic officious and callous They wouldnt evenlift a finger to save their own grandmothers  from  the  RavenousBugblatter  Beast  of  Traal without orders signed in triplicatesent in sent back queried lost  found  subjected  to  publicinquiry lost again and finally buried in soft peat and recycledas firelightersThe best way to get a drink out of a  Vogon  is  to  stick  yourfinger  down  his  throat and the best way to irritate him is tofeed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of TraalOn no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at youArthur blinked at itWhat a strange book How did we get a lift thenThats the point its out of date now said Ford sliding  thebook  back  into its cover Im doing the field research for theNew Revised Edition and one of the things Ill have  to  includeis  a  bit  about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks whichgives us a rather useful little loopholeA pained expression crossed  Arthurs  face  But  who  are  theDentrassi he saidGreat guys said Ford Theyre the best  cooks  and  the  bestdrink  mixers and they dont give a wet slap about anything elseAnd theyll always help hitch hikers aboard partly because  theylike  the company but mostly because it annoys the Vogons Whichis exactly the sort of thing  you  need  to  know  if  youre  animpoverished  hitch  hiker  trying  to  see  the  marvels  of theUniverse for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day And  thatsmy job Fun isnt itArthur looked lostIts  amazing  he  said  and  frowned  at  one  of  the  othermattressesUnfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than  Iintended  said  Ford  I  came  for  a  week and got stuck forfifteen yearsBut how did you get there in the first place thenEasy I got a lift with a teaserA teaserYeahEr what is A teaser Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do Theycruise around looking for planets which havent made interstellarcontact yet and buzz themBuzz them Arthur began to feel that Ford was  enjoying  makinglife difficult for himYeah said Ford they buzz them They find some isolated  spotwith  very  few  people around then land right by some poor soulwhom no ones ever going to believe and then strut up and down infront  of  him  wearing  silly antennae on their heads and makingbeep beep noises Rather childish really Ford leant back on themattress  with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatinglypleased with himselfFord insisted Arthur I dont know  if  this  sounds  like  asilly question but what am I doing hereWell you know that said Ford I rescued you from the EarthAnd whats happened to the EarthAh Its been demolishedHas it said Arthur levellyYes It just boiled away into spaceLook said Arthur Im a bit upset about thatFord frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around hismindYes I can understand that he said at lastUnderstand that shouted Arthur Understand thatFord sprang upKeep looking at the book he hissed urgentlyWhatDont PanicIm not panickingYes you areAlright so Im panicking what else is there to doYou just come along with me and have a good time The Galaxys afun place Youll need to have this fish in your earI beg your pardon asked Arthur rather politely he thoughtFord was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly  had  asmall  yellow fish wriggling around in it Arthur blinked at himHe wished there was something simple and  recognizable  he  couldgrasp hold of He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassiunderwear the piles of Squornshellous  mattresses  and  the  manfrom  Betelgeuse  holding  up a small yellow fish and offering toput it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet  ofcorn flakes He couldnt and he didnt feel safeSuddenly a violent noise leapt at them from  no  source  that  hecould  identify  He  gasped in terror at what sounded like a mantrying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolvesShush said Ford Listen it might be importantIm  importantIts the Vogon captain making an announcement on the TannoyYou mean thats how the Vogons talkListenBut I cant speak VogonYou dont need to Just put that fish in your earFord with a lightning movement clapped  his  hand  to  Arthursear  and  he  had  the  sudden  sickening  sensation of the fishslithering deep into his aural  tract  Gasping  with  horror  hescrabbled  at  his ear for a second or so but then slowly turnedgoggleeyed with wonder He was experiencing the aural equivalentof  looking  at  a  picture  of  two  black silhouetted faces andsuddenly seeing it as a picture of a  white  candlestick  Or  oflooking  at  a  lot  of  coloured  dots on a piece of paper whichsuddenly resolve themselves into the figure  six  and  mean  thatyour  optician  is  going  to charge you a lot of money for a newpair of glassesHe was still listening to the howling gargles he knew that onlynow  it  had  taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforwardEnglishThis is what he heard Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle  howl  garglehowl  howl  gargle  gargle  howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrpuuuurgh should have a good time Message repeats  This  is  yourcaptain   speaking   so  stop  whatever  youre  doing  and  payattention First of all I see from our instruments that we have acouple of hitchhikers aboard Hello wherever you are I just wantto make it totally clear that you  are  not  at  all  welcome  Iworked  hard to get where I am today and I didnt become captainof a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxiservice  for  a load of degenerate freeloaders I have sent out asearch party and as soon that they find you I will put  you  offthe ship If youre very lucky I might read you some of my poetryfirstSecondly we are about to jump into hyperspace for  the  journeyto  Barnards  Star  On  arrival  we  will  stay  in  dock for aseventytwo hour refit and no ones to  leave  the  ship  duringthat time I repeat all planet leave is cancelled Ive just hadan unhappy love affair so I dont see why  anybody  else  shouldhave a good time Message endsThe noise stoppedArthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was  lying  curledup  in  a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round hishead He smiled weaklyCharming man he said I wish I had  a  daughter  so  I  couldforbid her to marry one You wouldnt need to said  Ford  Theyve  got  as  much  sexappeal  as  a  road accident No dont move he added as Arthurbegan to uncurl himself youd better be prepared for  the  jumpinto hyperspace Its unpleasantly like being drunkWhats so unpleasant about being drunkYou ask a glass of waterArthur thought about thisFord he saidYeahWhats this fish doing in my earIts translating for you Its a Babel fish Look it up  in  thebook if you likeHe tossed over The Hitch Hikers Guide to  the  Galaxy  and  thencurled  himself  up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for thejumpAt that moment the bottom fell out of Arthurs mindHis eyes turned inside out His feet began to leak out of the topof his headThe room folded flat about  him  spun  around  shifted  out  ofexistence and left him sliding into his own navelThey were passing through hyperspaceThe Babel fish said The Hitch  Hikers  Guide  to  the  Galaxyquietly  is  small  yellow  and  leechlike  and probably theoddest thing in the Universe It feeds on  brainwave  energy  notfrom  its  carrier  but  from  those  around  it  It absorbs allunconscious mental frequencies  from  this  brainwave  energy  tonourish  itself  with  It  then  excretes  into  the mind of itscarrier a telepathic matrix formed  by  combining  the  consciousthought  frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speechcentres of the brain  which  has  supplied  them  The  practicalupshot  of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your earyou can instantly understand anything said to you in any form  oflanguage  The  speech  patterns  you  actually  hear  decode thebrainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your  BabelfishNow it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that  anythingso  mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance thatsome thinkers have chosen to see it as the  final  and  clinchingproof of the nonexistence of GodThe argument goes something like this I refuse to prove that Iexist says God for proof denies faith and without faith I amnothingBut says Man The Babel fish is a dead giveaway  isnt  itIt  could not have evolved by chance It proves you exist and sotherefore by your own arguments you dont QEDOh dear says God I hadnt thought of  that  and  promptlyvanished in a puff of logicOh that was easy says Man and for  an  encore  goes  on  toprove  that  black  is  white and gets himself killed on the nextzebra crossingMost leading theologians claim that this argument is a  load  ofdingos  kidneys  but  that didnt stop Oolon Colluphid making asmall fortune when he used it as the central theme of  his  bestselling book Well That About Wraps It Up For GodMeanwhile the poor Babel  fish  by  effectively  removing  allbarriers  to  communication between different races and cultureshas caused more and bloddier  wars  than  anything  else  in  thehistory of creationArthur let out a low groan He was horrified to discover that thekick  through  hyperspace hadnt killed him He was now six lightyears from the place that the Earth would have been if  it  stillexistedThe EarthVisions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind  Therewas  no  way  his  imagination could feel the impact of the wholeEarth having gone it was too big He  prodded  his  feelings  bythinking  that  his parents and his sister had gone No reactionHe thought of all the people he had been close to  No  reactionThen  he  thought  of  a  complete  stranger he had been standingbehind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt  a  suddenstab    the  supermarket  was  gone  everything in it was goneNelsons Column

When he came round a second later he found he  wassobbing for his motherHe jerked himself violently to his feetFordFord looked up from where he was sitting in a corner  humming  tohimself He always found the actual travellingthroughspace partof space travel rather tryingYeah he saidIf youre a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earthyou must have been gathering material on itWell I was able to extend the original entry a bit yesLet me see what it says in this edition then Ive  got  to  seeitYeah OK He passed it over againArthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking Hepressed  the  entry for the relevant page The screen flashed andswirled and resolved into a page of print Arthur stared at itIt doesnt have an entry he burst outFord looked over his shoulderYes it does he said down there see at  the  bottom  of  thescreen  just  under  Eccentrica  Gallumbits the triplebreastedwhore of Eroticon Arthur followed Fords finger and saw where it was pointing Fora moment it still didnt register then his mind nearly blew upWhat Harmless Is that all  its  got  to  say  Harmless  OnewordFord shruggedWell there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and  onlya  limited  amount  of  space  in the books microprocessors hesaid and no one knew much about the Earth of courseWell for Gods sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bitOh yes well I managed to  transmit  a  new  entry  off  to  theeditor He had to trim it a bit but its still an improvementAnd what does it say now asked ArthurMostly harmless admitted  Ford  with  a  slightly  embarrassedcoughMostly harmless shouted ArthurWhat was that noise hissed FordIt was me shouting shouted ArthurNo Shut up said Ford I think were in troubleYou think were in troubleOutside the door were the sounds of marching feetThe Dentrassi whispered ArthurNo those are steel tipped boots said FordThere was a sharp ringing rap on the doorThen who is it said ArthurWell said Ford if were lucky its just the Vogons  come  tothrow us in to spaceAnd if were unluckyIf were unlucky said  Ford  grimly  the  captain  might  beserious  in  his  threat  that  hes going to read us some of hispoetry first

poetry of all  perished  along  with  its  creatorPaula  Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge Essex England inthe destruction of the planet EarthProstetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly This was done  not  somuch for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequenceof muscle movements He had had a terribly  therapeutic  yell  athis  prisoners  and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for alittle callousnessThe prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation  Chairs  strapped  inVogons  suffered  no  illusions as to the regard their works weregenerally held in Their early attempts at composition  had  beenpart  of  bludgeoning  insistence  that  they  be  accepted  as aproperly evolved and cultured race but now the only  thing  thatkept them going was sheer bloodymindednessThe sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefects brow and  slid  roundthe  electrodes strapped to his temples These were attached to abattery of electronic equipment  imagery intensifiers  rhythmicmodulators  alliterative  residulators  and simile dumpers  alldesigned to heighten the experience of the  poem  and  make  surethat not a single nuance of the poets thought was lostArthur Dent sat and quivered He had no idea what he was in  forbut  he  knew  that he hadnt liked anything that had happened sofar and didnt think things were likely to changeThe Vogon began to read  a  fetid  little  passage  of

from  a  small  planet in the vicinity ofBetelgeuse and wouldnt have cared if he  had  I  present  youwith  a simple choice Either die in the vacuum of space or he paused for melodramatic effect tell me how good you  thoughtmy poem wasHe threw himself backwards into a huge leathery  batshaped  seatand watched them He did the smile againFord was rasping for breath He rolled his dusty tongue round hisparched mouth and moanedArthur said brightly Actually I quite liked itFord turned and gaped Here was an approach that had quite simplynot occurred to himThe Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow  that  effectively  obscuredhis nose and was therefore no bad thingOh good  he whirred in considerable astonishmentOh yes said Arthur I thought that some of  the  metaphysicalimagery was really particularly effectiveFord continued to stare at him slowly  organizing  his  thoughtsaround  this  totally  new  concept Were they really going to beable to bareface their way out of thisYes do continue  invited the VogonOh  and er  interesting rhythmic devices  too  continuedArthur  which  seemed to counterpoint the  er  er  HeflounderedFord leaped to his rescue hazarding counterpoint the surrealismof  the underlying metaphor of the  er  He floundered toobut Arthur was ready again humanity of the Vogonity Ford hissed at himAh yes Vogonity sorry  of  the  poets  compassionate  soulArthur  felt  he  was  on  a  home  stretch now which contrivesthrough the medium of the  verse  structure  to  sublimate  thistranscend   that   and   come  to  terms  with  the  fundamentaldichotomies  of  the  other  he  was  reaching  a   triumphantcrescendo  and one is left with a profound and vivid insightinto  into  er   which suddenly gave out  on  himFord leaped in with the coup de grceInto whatever it was the poem was about he yelled Out of  thecorner of his mouth Well done Arthur that was very goodThe Vogon perused them For a moment his embittered  racial  soulhad  been  touched  but he thought no  too little too late Hisvoice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylonSo what youre saying is that I write poetry because  underneathmy  mean  callous  heartless  exterior  I  really just want to beloved he said He paused Is that rightFord laughed a nervous laugh Well I mean yes he said  dontwe all deep down you know  er The Vogon stood upNo well youre completely wrong he said I just write poetryto  throw  my  mean callous heartless exterior into sharp reliefIm going to throw you off  the  ship  anyway  Guard  Take  theprisoners to number three airlock and throw them outWhat shouted FordA huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them  out  oftheir straps with his huge blubbery armsYou cant throw us into space yelled Ford  were  trying  towrite a bookResistance is useless shouted the Vogon guard back at him  Itwas  the  first phrase hed learnt when he joined the Vogon GuardCorpsThe captain watched with detached amusement and then turned awayArthur stared round him wildlyI dont want to die now he yelled Ive still got a headacheI  dont  want  to go to heaven with a headache Id be all crossand wouldnt enjoy itThe guard grasped them both firmly round  the  neck  and  bowingdeferentially  towards  his  captains  back  hoiked  them  bothprotesting out of the bridge A steel door closed and the captainwas  on  his  own  again He hummed quietly and mused to himselflightly fingering his notebook of versesHmmmm he said counterpoint the surrealism of the  underlyingmetaphor    He  considered this for a moment and then closedthe book with a grim smileDeaths too good for them he saidThe long steellined corridor echoed to the feeble  struggles  ofthe two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpitsThis is great spluttered Arthur this is really terrific Letgo of me you bruteThe Vogon guard dragged them onDont you worry said  Ford  Ill  think  of  something  Hedidnt sound hopefulResistance is useless bellowed the guardJust dont say things  like  that  stammered  Ford  How  cananyone  maintain  a  positive  mental  attitude  if youre sayingthings like thatMy God complained Arthur youre  talking  about  a  positivemental  attitude  and you havent even had your planet demolishedtoday I woke up this morning and thought Id have a nice relaxedday  do  a bit of reading brush the dog  Its now just afterfour in the afternoon and Im already  thrown  out  of  an  alienspaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the EarthHe spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his gripAlright said Ford just stop panickingWho said anything about panicking  snapped  Arthur  This  isstill  just  the  culture  shock You wait till Ive settled downinto the  situation  and  found  my  bearings  Then  Ill  startpanickingArthur  youre  getting  hysterical  Shut   up   Ford   trieddesperately  to  think but was interrupted by the guard shoutingagainResistance is uselessAnd you can shut up as well snapped FordResistance is uselessOh give it a rest said Ford He twisted his head till  he  waslooking straight up into his captors face A thought struck himDo you really enjoy this sort of thing he asked suddenlyThe Vogon stopped dead and a look  of  immense  stupidity  seepedslowly over his faceEnjoy he boomed What do you meanWhat I mean said Ford is does it give you a full  satisfyinglife Stomping around shouting pushing people out of spaceshipsThe Vogon stared up at the low steel  ceiling  and  his  eyebrowsalmost  rolled  over  each  other  His mouth slacked Finally hesaid Well the hours are good Theyd have to be agreed FordArthur twisted his head to look at FordFord what are you doing he asked in an amazed whisperOh just trying to take an interest in the world around me OKhe said So the hours are pretty good then he resumedThe Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts  moiled  aroundin the murky depthsYeah he said but now you come to mention  it  most  of  theactual  minutes  are  pretty lousy Except  he thought againwhich required looking at the  ceiling    except  some  of  theshouting  I  quite  like  He  filled  his  lungs  and bellowedResistance is Sure yes interrupted Ford hurriedly youre good at that  Ican  tell  But if its mostly lousy he said slowly giving thewords time to reach their mark then why do you do it  What  isit  The  girls  The  leather The machismo Or do you just findthat coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all  presentsan interesting challengeEr  said the guard er  er  I dunno I think  I  justsort of  do it really My aunt said that spaceship guard was agood career for a young Vogon  you know the uniform  the  lowslung stun ray holster the mindless tedium There you are  Arthur  said  Ford  with  the  air  of  someonereaching  the  conclusion  of his argument you think youve gotproblemsArthur rather thought he had Apart from the unpleasant  businesswith  his  home  planet  the  Vogon  guard had halfthrottled himalready and he didnt like the sound of being thrown  into  spacevery muchTry and understand his problem insisted Ford Here he is poorlad  his  entire lifes work is stamping around throwing peopleoff spaceships And shouting added the guardAnd shouting sure said Ford patting the blubbery arm  clampedround  his  neck  in  friendly condescension  and he doesnteven know why hes doing itArthur agreed this was very sad He did this with a small  feeblegesture because he was too asphyxicated to speakDeep rumblings of bemusement came from the guardWell Now you put it like that I suppose Good lad encouraged FordBut  alright  went  on   the   rumblings   so   whats   thealternativeWell said Ford brightly but slowly stop doing it of courseTell  them  he went on youre not going to do it anymore Hefelt he had to add something to that  but  for  the  moment  theguard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that muchEerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  said the  guard erm well that doesnt sound that great to meFord suddenly felt the moment slipping awayNow wait a minute he said thats just  the  start  you  seetheres more to it than that you see But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and  continued  hisoriginal  purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock He wasobviously quite touchedNo I think if its all the same to you he said  Id  betterget you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on withsome other bits of shouting Ive got to doIt wasnt all the same to Ford Prefect after allCome on now  but look he said less slowly less brightlyHuhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn    said  Arthur   without   any   clearinflectionBut hang on pursued Ford theres music and art and things totell you about yet ArrrggghhhResistance is useless bellowed the guard and then added Yousee  if  I  keep  it  up  I can eventually get promoted to SeniorShouting Officer and there arent  usually  many  vacancies  fornonshouting  and  nonpushingpeopleabout  officers so I thinkId better stick to what I knowThey had now  reached  the  airlock    a  large  circular  steelhatchway  of  massive strength and weight let into the inner skinof the craft The guard operated a control and the hatchway swungsmoothly openBut thanks for taking an interest said the Vogon  guard  Byenow  He  flung  Ford  and  Arthur through the hatchway into thesmall  chamber  within  Arthur  lay  panting  for  breath  Fordscrambled  round  and  flung  his  shoulder uselessly against thereclosing hatchwayBut listen he shouted to the guard theres a whole world youdont  know  anything about  here how about this Desperatelyhe grabbed for the only bit of  culture  he  knew  offhand    hehummed the first bar of Beethovens FifthDa da da dum Doesnt that stir anything in youNo said the guard not really But  Ill  mention  it  to  myauntIf he said anything further after that it was lost The  hatchwaysealed itself tight and all sound was lost but the faint distanthum of the ships enginesThey were in a brightly polished cylindrical  chamber  about  sixfeet in diameter and ten feet longPotentially bright lad I thought he said and  slumped  againstthe curved wallArthur was still lying in the curve of the  floor  where  he  hadfallen He didnt look up He just lay pantingWere trapped now arent weYes said Ford were trappedWell didnt you think of anything I thought you said  you  weregoing to think of something Perhaps you thought of something anddidnt noticeOh yes I thought of something panted Ford Arthur  looked  upexpectantlyBut unfortunately continued Ford it rather involved being onthe  other  side  of this airtight hatchway He kicked the hatchtheyd just been throughBut it was a good idea was itOh yes very neatWhat was itWell I hadnt worked out the details yet Not much point now  isthereSo  er what happens nextOh er well the hatchway in front of us will open automaticallyin  a  few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expectand asphyxicate If you take a lungful of air with  you  you  canlast  for up to thirty seconds of course  said Ford He stuckhis hands behind his back raised his eyebrows and started to human  old  Betelgeusian  battle  hymn To Arthurs eyes he suddenlylooked very alienSo this is it said Arthur were going to dieYes said Ford except  no Wait  a  minute  he  suddenlylunged  across  the  chamber at something behind Arthurs line ofvision Whats this switch he criedWhat Where cried Arthur twisting roundNo I was only fooling said Ford we are going to  die  afterallHe slumped against the wall again and carried on  the  tune  fromwhere he left offYou know said Arthur its  at  times  like  this  when  Imtrapped  in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and aboutto die of asphyxication in deep space  that  I  really  wish  Idlistened to what my mother told me when I was youngWhy what did she tell youI dont know I didnt listenOh Ford carried on hummingThis is terrific Arthur thought to himself  Nelsons  Columnhas  gone  McDonalds  have  gone all thats left is me and thewords Mostly Harmless Any second now all that will  be  left  isMostly  Harmless  And yesterday the planet seemed to be going sowellA motor whirredA slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air  as  theouter  hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tinyimpossibly bright points of light Ford and  Arthur  popped  intoouter space like corks from a toy gunThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the  Galaxy  is  a  wholly  remarkablebook  It  has  been compiled and recompiled many times over manyyears  and  under  many  different   editorships   It   containscontributions   from   countless   numbers   of   travellers  andresearchersThe introduction begins like thisSpace it says is big Really big You just wont believe howvastly  hugely mindboggingly big it is I mean you may think itsa long way down the road to the chemist but thats just  peanutsto space Listen  and so onAfter a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tellyou  things  you  really  need  to  know  like the fact that thefabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so  worried  aboutthe  cumulative  erosion  by ten billion visiting tourists a yearthat any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the  amountyou  excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from yourbodyweight when you leave so every time you go to  the  lavatoryit is vitally important to get a receiptTo be fair though when  confronted  by  the  sheer  enormity  ofdistances   between   the   stars  better  minds  than  the  oneresponsible for the  Guides  introduction  have  faltered  Someinvite  you  to  consider  for a moment a peanut in reading and asmall walnut in Johannesburg and other such dizzying conceptsThe simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit intothe human imaginationEven light which travels  so  fast  that  it  takes  most  racesthousands  of years to realize that it travels at all takes timeto journey between the stars It takes  eight  minutes  from  thestar  Sol to the place where the Earth used to be and four yearsmore to arrive at Sols nearest stellar neighbour Alpha ProximaFor light to reach the other side of the Galaxy for it to  reachDamogran for instance takes rather longer five hundred thousandyearsThe record for hitch hiking this  distance  is  just  under  fiveyears but you dont get to see much on the wayThe Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy says that  if  you  hold  alungful  of  air you can survive in the total vacuum of space forabout thirty seconds However it goes on to say  that  what  withspace  being  the mind boggling size it is the chances of gettingpicked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two  tothe  power  of two hundred and sixtyseven thousand seven hundredand nine to one againstBy a totally staggering coincidence that is  also  the  telephonenumber of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very goodparty and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get  offwith  she went off with a gatecrasherThough the planet Earth the Islington  flat  and  the  telephonehave  all  now  been demolished it is comforting to reflect thatthey are all in some small way  commemorated  by  the  fact  thattwentynine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescuedA computer chatted to itself in alarm as it  noticed  an  airlockopen and close itself for no apparent reasonThis was because Reason was in fact out to lunchA hole had  just  appeared  in  the  Galaxy  It  was  exactly  anothingth  of  a  second  long  a nothingth of an inch wide andquite a lot of million light years from end to endAs it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out ofit  and  drifted off through the universe A team of seven threefoothigh market analysts fell out of  it  and  died  partly  ofasphyxication partly of surpriseTwo hundred and thirtynine thousand lightly fried eggs fell  outof  it  too  materializing in a large woobly heap on the faminestruck land of Poghril in the Pansel systemThe whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except  for  onelast man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks laterThe nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberatedbackwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashionSomewhere in the deeply remote past it  seriously  traumatized  asmall  random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterilityof space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarilyunlikely   patterns   These  patterns  quickly  learnt  to  copythemselves this was part of what was  so  extraordinary  of  thepatterns  and  went  on to cause massive trouble on every planetthey drifted on to That was how life began in the UniverseFive wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of  unreasonand spewed up a pavementOn the pavement lay Ford Prefect and  Arthur  Dent  gulping  likehalfspent fishThere you are gasped Ford scrabbling for a fingerhold on  thepavement  as  it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown Itold you Id think of somethingOh sure said Arthur sureBright idea of mine said Ford to find  a  passing  spaceshipand get rescued by itThe real universe arched sickeningly away beneath  them  Variouspretend  ones  flitted  silently  by like mountain goats Primallight exploded splattering spacetime as with gobbets of junketTime  blossomed  matter  shrank  away  The highest prime numbercoalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for everOh come off it said  Arthur  the  chances  against  it  wereastronomicalDont knock it it worked said FordWhat sort of ship are  we  in  asked  Arthur  as  the  pit  ofeternity yawned beneath themI dont know said Ford I havent opened my eyes yetNo nor have I said ArthurThe Universe jumped froze quivered and splayed out  in  severalunexpected directionsArthur  and  Ford  opened  their  eyes  and   looked   about   inconsiderable surpriseGood god said Arthur it looks just like  the  sea  front  atSouthendHell Im relieved to hear you say that said FordWhyBecause I thought I must be going madPerhaps you are Perhaps you only thought I said itFord thought about thisWell did you say it or didnt you he askedI think so said ArthurWell perhaps were both going madYes said Arthur wed be mad all things considered to thinkthis was SouthendWell do you think this is SouthendOh yesSo do ITherefore we must be madNice day for itYes said a passing maniacWho was that asked ArthurWho  the man with the five heads and the elderberry  bush  fullof kippersYesI dont know Just someoneAhThey both sat on the pavement and watched with a  certain  uneaseas  huge  children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horsesthundered through the sky taking  fresh  supplies  of  reinforcedrailings to the Uncertain AreasYou know  said  Arthur  with  a  slight  cough  if  this  isSouthend theres something very odd about it You mean the way the sea stays steady  and  the  buildings  keepwashing up and down said Ford Yes I thought that was odd tooIn fact he continued as with a huge bang Southend split  itselfinto  six equal segments which danced and span giddily round eachother in lewd  and  licentious  formation  there  is  somethingaltogether very strange going onWild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the windhot  doughnuts  popped out of the road for ten pence each horridfish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make arun for itThey plunged through heavy walls of sound mountains  of  archaic thought  valleys  of  mood music bad shoe sessions and footlingbats and suddenly heard a girls voiceIt sounded quite a sensible voice but it just said Two to  thepower  of  one  hundred thousand to one against and falling andthat was allFord skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find asource  for  the  voice  but could see nothing he could seriouslybelieve inWhat was that voice shouted ArthurI dont know yelled Ford I dont know  It  sounded  like  ameasurement of probabilityProbability What do you meanProbability You know like two to one three to  one  five  tofour against It said two to the power of one hundred thousand toone against Thats pretty improbable you knowA milliongallon vat of custard upended itself over them  withoutwarningBut what does it mean cried ArthurWhat the custardNo the measurement of probabilityI dont know I dont know at all I think were on some kind ofspaceshipI can only assume said Arthur that this is  not  the  firstclass compartmentBulges appeared in the fabric of spacetime Great ugly bulgesHaaaauuurrgghhh  said Arthur as he felt his  body  softeningand  bending in unusual directions Southend seems to be meltingaway  the stars are swirling  a dustbowl   my  legs  aredrifting  off  into the sunset  my left arms come off too Afrightening thought struck him Hell he said how am I  goingto  operate  my digital watch now He wound his eyes desperatelyaround in Fords directionFord he said youre turning into a penguin Stop itAgain came the voiceTwo to the power of seventyfive thousand  to  one  against  andfallingFord waddled around his pond in a furious circleHey who are you he quacked Where are you Whats  going  onand is there any way of stopping itPlease relax said the voice pleasantly like a  stewardess  inan airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is onfire you are perfectly safeBut thats not the point raged Ford The point is that  I  amnow  a  perfectly  save penguin and my colleague here is rapidlyrunning out of limbsIts alright Ive got them back now said ArthurTwo to the power of fifty thousand to one against and  fallingsaid the voiceAdmittedly said Arthur theyre longer than  I  usually  likethem but Isnt there anything squawked Ford in avian  fury  you  feelyou ought to be telling usThe voice cleared its throat A giant  petit  four  lolloped  offinto the distanceWelcome the voice said to the Starship Heart of GoldThe voice continuedPlease do not be alarmed it said by anything you see or heararound you You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as youhave been rescued from certain death at an improbability level oftwo  to  the power of two hundred and seventysix thousand to oneagainst  possibly much higher We are now cruising at a level oftwo  to  the  power  of  twentyfive  thousand to one against andfalling and we will be restoring normality just as  soon  as  weare  sure  what  is normal anyway Thank you Two to the power oftwenty thousand to one against and fallingThe voice cut outFord and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicleFord was wildly excitedArthur he said this is fantastic Weve been picked up by  aship  powered  by  the  Infinite  Improbability  Drive  This  isincredible I  heard  rumors  about  it  before  They  were  allofficially  denied but they must have done it Theyve built theImprobability  Drive  Arthur  this  is      Arthur   WhatshappeningArthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle tryingto  hold  it  closed  but  it was ill fitting Tiny furry littlehands were squeezing themselves through the cracks their fingerswere inkstained tiny voices chattered insanelyArthur looked upFord he said theres an infinite number of  monkeys  outsidewho  want  to  talk  to  us  about this script for Hamlet theyveworked outThe Infinite Improbability Drive is a  wonderful  new  method  ofcrossing  vast  interstellar  distances  in a mere nothingth of asecond without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspaceIt was discovered by a lucky chance and then  developed  into  agovernable  form  of  propulsion  by  the  Galactic  Governmentsresearch team on DamogranThis briefly is the story of its discoveryThe principle of generating small amounts of finite improbabilityby  simply  hooking  the  logic circuits of a Bambleweeny  SubMeson Brain to an atomic vector plotter  suspended  in  a  strongBrownian  Motion  producer  say  a  nice hot cup of tea were ofcourse well understood  and such generators were often  used  tobreak  the  ice  at  parties  by  making all the molecules in thehostesss undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the leftin accordance with the Theory of IndeterminacyMany respectable physicists said that they werent going to standfor  this    partly  because it was a debasement of science butmostly because they didnt get invited to those sort of partiesAnother thing they couldnt stand was the perpetual failure  theyencountered in trying to construct a machine which could generatethe infinite improbability  field  needed  to  flip  a  spaceshipacross  the mindparalysing distances between the furthest starsand in the end they grumpily announced that such  a  machine  wasvirtually impossibleThen one day a student who had been left to sweep  up  the  labafter  a  particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoningthis wayIf  he  thought  to  himself  such  a  machine  is  a   virtualimpossibility  then it must logically be a finite improbabilitySo all I have to do in order to make one is to work  out  exactlyhow   improbable   it  is  feed  that  figure  into  the  finiteimprobability generator give it a fresh cup of  really  hot  tea and turn it onHe did this and was rather startled  to  discover  that  he  hadmanaged   to   create  the  long  sought  after  golden  InfiniteImprobability generator out of thin airIt startled him even more when just  after  he  was  awarded  theGalactic  Institutes Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynchedby a rampaging mob of  respectable  physicists  who  had  finallyrealized  that  the  one  thing  they really couldnt stand was asmartassThe Improbabilityproof control cabin of the Heart of Gold lookedlike  a  perfectly  conventional  spaceship  except  that  it wasperfectly clean because it was so new Some of the control  seatshadnt  had  the  plastic  wrapping  taken off yet The cabin wasmostly  white  oblong  and  about  the  size  of   a   smallishrestaurant  In  fact  it  wasnt  perfectly oblong the two longwalls were raked round in a slight parallel curve  and  all  theangles  and  corners  were contoured in excitingly chunky shapesThe truth of the matter is that it would have been a  great  dealsimpler  and  more  practical  to  build the cabin as an ordinarythreedimensional oblong rom but then the designers  would  havegot  miserable As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposefulwith large video screens ranged over  the  control  and  guidancesystem  panels  on  the concave wall and long banks of computersset into the convex wall In one corner a robot sat  humped  itsgleaming  brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleamingbrushed steel knees It too was fairly new  but  though  it  wasbeautifully  constructed and polished it somehow looked as if thevarious parts of its more or less humanoid body didnt quite  fitproperly  In  fact  they fitted perfectly well but something inits bearing suggested that they might have fitted betterZaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin brushinghis  hands  over  pieces  of gleaming equipment and giggling withexcitementTrillian sat hunched over a  clump  of  instruments  reading  offfigures  Her  voice  was  carried round the Tannoy system of thewhole shipFive to one against and falling   she  said  four  to  oneagainst  and  falling    three  to  one    two   one probability factor of one to one  we have normality I  repeatwe  have  normality She turned her microphone off  then turnedit back on with a slight  smile  and  continued  Anything  youstill  cant  cope  with  is  therefore  your own problem Pleaserelax You will be sent for soonZaphod burst out in annoyance Who are they TrillianTrillian span her seat round to face him and shruggedJust a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open  spaceshe said Section ZZ Plural Z AlphaYeah well thats a very  sweet  thought  Trillian  complainedZaphod   but   do   you   really  think  its  wise  under  thecircumstances I mean here we are on the run and everything  wemust  have  the police of half the Galaxy after us by now and westop to pick up hitch hikers OK so ten out of  ten  for  stylebut minus several million for good thinking yeahHe tapped irritably at a control panel  Trillian  quietly  movedhis  hand  before he tapped anything important Whatever Zaphodsqualities of mind might include  dash bravado conceit  he wasmechanically  inept  and  could  easily  blow the ship up with anextravagant gesture Trillian had come to suspect that  the  mainreason  why  he  had  had such a wild and successful life that henever really understood the significance of anything he didZaphod she said patiently they were floating unprotected  inopen space  you wouldnt want them to have died would youWell you know  no Not as such but Not as such Not die as such But Trillian cocked her head  onone sideWell maybe someone else might have picked them up laterA second later and they would have been deadYeah so if youd taken the trouble to think about the problem abit longer it would have gone awayYoud been happy to let them dieWell you know not happy as such but Anyway said Trillian turning back to the controls I  didntpick them upWhat do you mean Who picked them up thenThe ship didHuhThe ship did All by itselfHuhWhilst we were in Improbability DriveBut thats incredibleNo Zaphod Just very very improbableEr yeahLook Zaphod she said patting his arm dont worry about  thealiens  Theyre  just  a  couple of guys I expect Ill send therobot down to get them and bring them up here Hey MarvinIn the corner the  robots  head  swung  up  sharply  but  thenwobbled  about imperceptibly  It pulled itself up to its feet asif it was about five pounds heavier that  it  actually  was  andmade  what  an  outside  observer would have thought was a heroiceffort to cross the room It stopped in  front  of  Trillian  andseemed to stare through her left shoulderI think you ought to know Im feeling very depressed it  saidIts voice was low and hopelessOh God muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seatWell said Trillian in a  bright  compassionate  tone  heressomething to

convey his utter contempt and horror  of  allthings humanJust that he saidYes said Trillian firmlyI wont enjoy it said MarvinZaphod leaped out of his seatShes not asking you to enjoy it he shouted just do it  willyouAlright said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked  bellIll do itGood  snapped Zaphod great  thank you Marvin turned and lifted his flattopped triangular red  eyes  uptowards himIm not getting you down at all am I he said patheticallyNo no Marvin lilted Trillian thats just fine really I wouldnt like to think that I was getting you downNo dont worry about that the lilt continued you  just  actas comes naturally and everything will be just fineYoure sure you dont mind probed MarvinNo no Marvin lilted Trillian thats just  fine  really  just part of lifeMarvin flashed him an electronic lookLife said Marvin dont talk to me about lifeHe turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself  out  of  thecabin  With  a  satisfied hum and a click the door closed behindhimI

Improbability itpasses through every point in the Universe Be the envy of  othermajor governments Wow this is big league stuffFord hunted excitedly through the technical specs  of  the  shipoccasionally  gasping with astonishment at what he read  clearlyGalactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of  hisexileArthur listened for a short while but being unable to understandthe  vast  majority  of  what Ford was saying he began to let hismind  wander  trailing  his  fingers  along  the  edge   of   anincomprehensible  computer  bank  he  reached out and pressed aninvitingly large red button on a nearby panel The panel  lit  upwith  the  words  Please do not press this button again He shookhimselfListen said  Ford  who  was  still  engrossed  in  the

thatOh it says Genuine People PersonalitiesOh said Arthur sounds ghastlyA voice behind them said It is The voice was low and hopelessand  accompanied  by a slight clanking sound They span round andsaw

to operate  For  yearsradios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turningdials then as  the  technology  became  more  sophisticated  thecontrols  were made touchsensitive  you merely had to brush thepanels with your fingers now all you had to  do  was  wave  yourhand  in  the  general  direction  of the components and hope Itsaved a lot of muscular expenditure of course but meant that youhad to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening tothe same programmeZaphod waved a hand and the channel  switched  again  More  gunkmusic  but this time it was a background to a news announcementThe news was always heavily edited to  fit  the  rhythms  of  themusic and news brought to you here  on  the  subetha  wave  bandbroadcasting  around  the  galaxy  around  the clock squawked avoice and well be saying a big hello to all  intelligent  lifeforms  everywhere   and to everyone else out there the secretis to bang the rocks together guys And of course the big  newsstory  tonight  is the sensational theft of the new ImprobabilityDrive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President ZaphodBeeblebrox And the question everyones asking is  has the bigZ finally flipped Beeblebrox  the  man  who  invented  the  PanGalactic  Gargle Blaster exconfidence trickster once describedby Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One  andrecently  voted  the  Wort  Dressed  Sentinent Being in the KnownUniverse for the seventh time  has he got an answer this timeWe  asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt  Themusic swirled and dived for a moment  Another  voice  broke  inpresumably  Halfrunt  He  said Vell Zaphods jist zis guy youknow but got no further because an electric pencil flew  acrossthe  cabin  and  through  the  radios onoff sensitive airspaceZaphod turned and glared at Trillian  she had thrown the pencilHey he said what do you do that forTrillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figuresIve just thought of something she saidYeah Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me forYou hear enough about yourself as it isIm very insecure We know thatCan we drop your ego for a moment This is importantIf theres anything more important than my ego around I want itcaught and shot now Zaphod glared at her again then laughedListen she said we picked up those couple of guys What couple of guysThe couple of guys we picked upOh yeah said Zaphod those couple of guysWe picked them up in sector ZZ  Plural Z AlphaYeah said Zaphod and blinkedTrillian said quietly Does that mean anything to youMmmmm said Zaphod ZZ  Plural Z Alpha ZZ  Plural Z AlphaWell said TrillianEr  what does the Z mean said ZaphodWhich oneAny oneOne  of  the  major  difficulties  Trillian  experienced  in  herrelationship  with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between himpretending to be stupid just  to  get  people  off  their  guardpretending  to be stupid because he couldnt be bothered to thinkand wanted someone else to  do  it  for  him  pretending  to  beoutrageously  stupid  to  hide  the  fact that he actually didntunderstand what was going on and really being genuinely  stupidHe  was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly wasso  but not all the time which obviously worried him hence theact  He proffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuousThis above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely  stupid  butshe could no longer be bothered to argue about itShe sighed and punched up a star map on  the  visiscreen  so  shecould make it simple for him whatever his reasons for wanting itto be that wayThere she pointed right thereHey  Yeah said ZaphodWell she saidWell whatParts of the inside of her head screamed at other  parts  of  theinside  of her head She said very calmly Its the same sectoryou originally picked me up inHe looked at her and then looked back at the screenHey yeah he said now that is wild We  should  have  zappedstraight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula How did we cometo be there I mean thats nowhereShe ignored thisImprobability Drive she said patiently You explained  it  tome  yourself  We  pass  through every point in the Universe youknow thatYeah but thats one wild coincidence isnt itYesPicking someone up at that  point  Out  of  the  whole  of  theUniverse  to choose from Thats just too  I want to work thisout ComputerThe  Sirius  Cybernetics  Corporation  Shipboard  Computer  whichcontrolled   and  permeated  every  particle of the ship switchedinto communication modeHi there it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tinyribbon  of ticker tape just for the record The ticker tape saidHi thereOh God said Zaphod He hadnt worked with  this  computer  forlong but had already learned to loathe itThe computer continued brash and cheery as  if  it  was  sellingdetergentI want you to know that whatever your problem I am here to helpyou solve itYeah yeah said Zaphod Look I think Ill just use a piece ofpaperSure thing said the computer spilling out its message into  awaste bin at the same time I understand If you ever want Shut up said Zaphod and snatching up a pencil sat  down  nextto Trillian at the consoleOK OK  said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closeddown its speech channel againZaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbabilityflight path scanner flashed silently up in front of themCan we work out said Zaphod from their point  of  view  whatthe Improbability of their rescue wasYes thats a constant said Trillian two to the power of twohundred  and  seventysix  thousand seven hundred and nine to oneagainstThats high Theyre two lucky lucky guysYesBut relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them  upTrillian punched up the figures They  showed  towtothe  powerofInfinityminusone  an  irrational  number  that  only  has aconventional meaning in Improbability physics its pretty low continued Zaphod with a slight whistleYes agreed Trillian and looked at him quizzicallyThats one big whack  of  Improbability  to  be  accounted  forSomething  pretty  improbable  has  got to show up on the balancesheet if its all going to add up into a pretty sumZaphod scribbled a few sums  crossed  them  out  and  threw  thepencil awayBats dots I cant work it outWellZaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation  and  grittedhis teethOK he said ComputerThe voice circuits sprang to life againWhy hello there they said ticker tape ticker tape  All  Iwant to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer Yeah well shut up and work something out for meSure thing chattered the computer  you  want  a  probabilityforecast based on Improbability data yeahOK the  computer  continued  Heres  an  interesting  littlenotion  Did you realize that most peoples lives are governed bytelephone numbersA pained look crawled across one of Zaphods faces and on to  theother oneHave you flipped he saidNo but you will when I tell you that Trillian  gasped  She  scrabbled   at   the   buttons   on   theImprobability flight path screenTelephone number she  said  Did  that  thing  say  telephonenumberNumbers flashed up on the screenThe computer had paused politely but now it continuedWhat I was about to say was that Dont bother please said TrillianLook what is this said ZaphodI dont know said Trillian but those aliens  theyre on theway  up  to the bridge with that wretched robot Can we pick themup on any monitor camerasMarvin trudged on down the corridor still moaning and then of course Ive got this terrible pain  in  all  thediodes down my left hand side No said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him ReallyOh yes said Marvin I mean Ive asked for them to be replacedbut no one ever listensI can imagineVague whistling and humming noises were coming from  Ford  Wellwell well he kept saying to himself Zaphod Beeblebrox Suddenly Marvin stopped and held up a handYou know whats happened now of courseNo what said Arthur who didnt what to knowWeve arrived at another of those doorsThere was a sliding door let  into  the  side  of  the  corridorMarvin eyed it suspiciouslyWell said Ford impatiently Do we go throughDo we go through mimicked Marvin Yes This is  the  entranceto the bridge I was told to take you to the bridge Probably thehighest demand that will be made on  my  intellectual  capacitiestoday I shouldnt wonderSlowly with great loathing he stepped towards the door like  ahunter stalking his prey Suddenly it slid openThank you it said for making a simple door very happyDeep in Marvins thorax gears groundFunny he intoned funerally how  just  when  you  think  lifecant possibly get any worse it suddenly doesHe heaved himself through the  door  and  left  Ford  and  Arthurstaring  at each other and shrugging their shoulders From insidethey heard Marvins voice againI suppose you want to see the aliens now he said Do you wantme  to  sit  in  a  corner and rust or just fall apart where ImstandingYeah just show them in would you Marvin came another voiceArthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughingWhats Shhh said Ford come inHe stepped through into the bridgeArthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a  manlolling  back  in  a  chair  with  his  feet on a control consolepicking the teeth in his righthand head with his left hand  Therighthand  head  seemed  to  be thoroughly preoccupied with thistask but the  lefthand  one  was  grinning  a  broad  relaxednonchalant  grin  The  number  of  things  that  Arthur couldntbelieve he was seeing was fairly large His jaw flapped about  ata loose end for a whileThe peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an  appallingaffectation of nonchalance said Ford hi how are you Glad youcould drop inFord was not going to be outcooledZaphod he drawled great to see you youre looking well theextra arm suits you Nice ship youve stolenArthur goggled at himYou mean you know this guy he said waving a  wild  finger  atZaphodKnow him exclaimed Ford hes  he paused and decided  todo the introductions the other way roundOh Zaphod this is a friend of mine Arthur Dent he said  Isaved him when his planet blew upOh sure said Zaphod hi Arthur glad you could make it  Hisrighthand head looked round casually said hi and went back tohaving his teeth pickedFord carried on And Arthur he said this is  my  semicousinZaphod Beeb Weve met said Arthur sharplyWhen youre cruising down the road  in  the  fast  lane  and  youlazily  sail  past a few hard driving cars and are feeling prettypleased with yourself and  then  accidentally  change  down  fromfourth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap outof your bonnet in a rather ugly mess it tends to throw  you  offyour  stride  in  much  the  same way that this remark threw FordPrefect off hisErr  whatI said weve metZaphod gave an  awkward  start  of  surprise  and  jabbed  a  gumsharplyHey  er have we Hey  er Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his  eyes  Now  hefelt  he  was  back  on  home  ground he suddenly began to resenthaving lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew  asmuch about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilfordbased gnat knewabout life in PekingWhat do you mean youve  met  he  demanded  This  is  ZaphodBeeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know not bloody Martin Smithfrom CroydonI dont care said Arthur coldly Weve met havent we  ZaphodBeeblebrox  or should I say  PhilWhat shouted FordYoull have to remind me said Zaphod Ive a terrible  memoryfor speciesIt was at a party pursued ArthurYeah well I doubt that said ZaphodCool it will you Arthur demanded FordArthur would not be deterred A party six months ago  On  Earth England Zaphod shook his head with a tightlipped smileLondon insisted Arthur IslingtonOh said Zaphod with a guilty start that partyThis wasnt fair on Ford at all He looked backwards and forwardsbetween  Arthur and Zaphod What he said to Zaphod You dontmean to say youve been on that miserable planet as well do youNo of course not said Zaphod breezily Well I may have justdropped in briefly you know on my way somewhere But I was stuck there for fifteen yearsWell I didnt know that did IBut what were you doing thereLooking about you knowHe gatecrashed a party persisted Arthur trembling with angera fancy dress party It would have to be wouldnt it said FordAt this party persisted Arthur was a girl  oh well  lookit  doesnt  matter  now  The  whole  place has gone up in smokeanyway I wish youd stop sulking about that bloody planet said  FordWho was the ladyOh just somebody Well alright I wasnt doing  very  well  withher Id been trying all evening Hell she was something thoughBeautiful charming devastatingly intelligent at last  Id  gother  to  myself  for  a bit and was plying her with a bit of talkwhen this friend of yours barges up and says Hey  doll  is  thisguy  boring  you  Why  dont  you talk to me instead Im from adifferent planet I never saw her againZaphod exclaimed FordYes said Arthur  glaring  at  him  and  trying  not  to  feelfoolish He only had the two arms and the one head and he calledhimself Phil but But you must admit he did turn out to be from  another  planetsaid  Trillian  wandering  into  sight  at  the  other end of thebridge She gave Arthur a pleasant smile  which  settled  on  himlike  a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the shipscontrols againThere was silence  for  a  few  seconds  and  then  out  of  thescrambled mess of Arthurs brain crawled some wordsTricia McMillian he said What are you doing hereSame as you she said I hitched a  lift  After  all  with  adegree  in  Maths and another in astrophysics what else was thereto do It was either that or the dole queue again on MondayInfinity minus one chattered the computer Improbability  sumnow completeZaphod looked  about  him  at  Ford  at  Arthur  and  then  atTrillianTrillian he said is this sort of thing going to happen everytime we use the Improbability driveVery probably Im afraid she saidThe Heart of Gold fled on silently through the  night  of  spacenow  on  conventional  photon drive Its crew of four were ill atease knowing that they had been brought together not of their ownvolition  or by simple coincidence but by some curious principleof physics  as if relationships between people were  susceptibleto  the  same  laws that governed the relationships between atomsand moleculesAs the ships artificial night closed in they were each  gratefulto  retire  to  separate  cabins  and  try  to  rationalize theirthoughtsTrillian couldnt sleep She sat on a couch and stared at a smallcage  which  contained  her  last and only links with Earth  twowhite mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her  bring  She  hadexpected  not  to  see the planet again but she was disturbed byher negative  reaction to the  planets  destruction  It  seemedremote  and  unreal and she could find no thoughts to think aboutit She watched the mice scurrying round  the  cage  and  runningfuriously  in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupiedher whole attention Suddenly she shook herself and went back  tothe  bridge  to  watch  over the tiny flashing lights and figuresthat charted the ships progress through the void She wished sheknew what it was she was trying not to think aboutZaphod couldnt sleep He also wished he knew what it was that hewouldnt  let  himself  think  about  For  as  long  as he couldremember hed suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being  notall there Most of the time he was able to put this thought asideand not worry about it but it had been reawakened by the suddeninexplicable  arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent Somehow itseemed to conform to a pattern that he couldnt seeFord couldnt sleep He was too excited about being back  on  theroad again Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over justas he was finally beginning to give up hope Knocking about  withZaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun though there seemedto be  something  faintly  odd  about  his  semicousin  that  hecouldnt put his finger on The fact that he had become Presidentof the Galaxy was frankly astonishing as was the manner  of  hisleaving the post Was there a reason behind it There would be nopoint in asking Zaphod he never appeared to have  a  reason  foranything  he  did  at all he had turned unfathomably into an artform  He  attacked  everything  in  life  with  a   mixture   ofextraordinary  genius  and  naive  incompetence  and it was oftendifficult to tell which was whichArthur slept he was terribly tiredThere was a tap at Zaphods door It slid openZaphod YeahI think we just found what you came to look forHey yeahFord gave up the attempt to sleep In the corner of his cabin wasa  small  computer  screen and keyboard He sat at it for a whileand tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject  ofVogons but couldnt think of anything vitriolic enough so he gavethat up too wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk  tothe bridgeAs he entered  he  was  surprised  to  see  two  figures  hunchedexcitedly over the instrumentsSee The ships about to move into orbit Trillian was  sayingTheres  a  planet  out there Its at the exact coordinates youpredictedZaphod heard a noise and looked upFord he hissed Hey come and take a look at thisFord went and had a look at  it  It  was  a  series  of  figuresflashing over a screenYou recognize those Galactic coordinates said ZaphodNoIll give you a clue ComputerHi gang enthused the computer This is getting real  sociableisnt itShut up said Zaphod and show up the screensLight on the bridge sank Pinpoints of light  played  across  theconsoles  and  reflected  in four pairs of eyes that stared up atthe external monitor screensThere was absolutely nothing on themRecognize that whispered ZaphodFord frownedEr no he saidWhat do you seeNothingRecognize itWhat are you talking aboutWere in the Horsehead Nebula One whole vast dark cloudAnd I was meant to recognize that from a blank screenInside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy youd see adark screenVery goodZaphod laughed He was  clearly  very  excited  about  somethingalmost childishly soHey this is really terrific this is just far too muchWhats so great about being stuck in a dust cloud said FordWhat would you reckon to find here urged ZaphodNothingNo stars No planetsNoComputer shouted Zaphod rotate angle of vision through  oneeighty degrees and dont talk about itFor a moment  it  seemed  that  nothing  was  happening  then  abrightness  glowed at the edge of the huge screen A red star thesize of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by anotherone    a  binary  system  Then  a vast crescent sliced into thecorner of the picture  a red glare shading away  into  the  deepblack the night side of the planetIve found it cried Zaphod thumping the console Ive  founditFord stared at it in astonishmentWhat is it he saidThat  said Zaphod is the most improbable planet that  everexistedExcerpt from The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy Page Section a Entry MagratheaFar back in the mists of ancient time in the great and  gloriousdays  of  the  former  Galactic  Empire  life was wild rich andlargely tax freeMighty starships plied their way  between  exotic  suns  seekingadventure  and  reward  amongst  the furthest reaches of Galacticspace In those days spirits were brave the  stakes  were  highmen  were  real  men  women  were  real  women  and small furrycreatures from Alpha Centauri were  real  small  furry  creaturesfrom  Alpha  Centauri And all dared to brave unknown terrors todo mighty deeds to boldly split  infinitives  that  no  man  hadsplit before  and thus was the Empire forgedMany men of course became extremely rich but this was  perfectlynatural  and  nothing  to be ashamed of because no one was reallypoor  at least no one worth speaking of And for all the richestand  most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dulland niggly and they began to imagine that this was therefore thefault of the worlds theyd settled on  none of them was entirelysatisfactory either the climate wasnt quite right in the  laterpart  of  the afternoon or the day was half an hour too long orthe sea was exactly the wrong shade of pinkAnd thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form ofspecialist industry custommade luxury planet building The homeof this industry was the  planet  Magrathea  where  hyperspatialengineers  sucked  matter through white holes in space to form itinto dream planets  gold planets platinum planets soft  rubberplanets  with lots of earthquakes  all lovingly made to meet theexacting standards that the Galaxys richest men  naturally  cameto expectBut so successful was this venture  that  Magrathea  itself  soonbecame  the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxywas reduced to abject poverty And so the system broke down  theEmpire  collapsed  and  a  long  sullen  silence  settled over abillion worlds disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholarsas  they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on thevalue of a planned political economyMagrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into  theobscurity of legendIn these enlightened days of course no one believes  a  word  ofitArthur awoke to the sound of argument and  went  to  the  bridgeFord was waving his arms aboutYoure crazy Zaphod he was saying Magrathea is  a  myth  afairy  story its what parents tell their kids about at night ifthey want them to grow up to become economists its And thats what we are  currently  in  orbit  around  insistedZaphodLook I cant help what you may personally be in orbit  aroundsaid Ford but this ship Computer shouted ZaphodOh no Hi there This is Eddie your shipboard computer and Im feelingjust  great  guys  and  I know Im just going to get a bundle ofkicks out of any programme you care to run through meArthur looked inquiringly at Trillian She motioned him  to  comeon in but keep quietComputer  said  Zaphod  tell  us  again  what  our   presenttrajectory isA real pleasure feller it burbled we are currently in  orbitat an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planetof MagratheaProving nothing said Ford I wouldnt trust that computer  tospeak my weightI can do that for you sure enthused  the  computer  punchingout  more  tickertape  I  can  even  work  out  you personalityproblems to ten decimal places if it will helpTrillian interruptedZaphod she said any minute now we will be swinging round  tothe daylight side of this planet adding whatever it turns outto beHey what do you mean by that The planets where I predicted itwould be isnt itYes I know theres a planet there Im not arguing with anyoneits  just  that I wouldnt know Magrathea from any other lump ofcold rock Dawns coming up if you want itOK OK muttered Zaphod lets at least give our eyes  a  goodtime ComputerHi there What can I Just shut up and give us a view of the planet againA dark featureless mass once more filled the screens  the planetrolling away beneath themThey watched for a moment in silence but Zaphod was fidgety withexcitementWe are now traversing the night side  he said  in  a  hushedvoice The planet rolled onThe surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath  us  he  continued He was trying to restore a sense of occasionto what he felt should have been a great  moment  Magrathea  Hewas piqued by Fords sceptical reaction MagratheaIn a few seconds he continued we should see  thereThe moment carried itself Even  the  most  seasoned  star  trampcant  help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seenfrom space but a binary sunrise is one of  the  marvels  of  theGalaxyOut of the utter blackness stabbed a  sudden  point  of  blindinglight  It  crept  up  by slight degrees and spread sideways in athin crescent blade and within seconds two  suns  were  visiblefurnaces  of  light  searing  the black edge of the horizon withwhite fire Fierce shafts of colour  streaked  through  the  thinatmosphere beneath themThe fires of dawn   breathed  Zaphod  The  twin  suns  ofSoulianis and Rahm  Or whatever said Ford quietlySoulianis and Rahm insisted ZaphodThe suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low  ghostly  musicfloated through the bridge Marvin was humming ironically becausehe hated humans so muchAs Ford gazed at the spectacle of light  before  them  excitementburnt inside him but only the excitement of seeing a strange newplanet it was enough for him to see it as  it  was  It  faintlyirritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy onto the scene to make it work for him All this Magrathea nonsenseseemed  juvenile  Isnt  it  enough  to  see  that  a  garden isbeautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at thebottom of it tooAll this Magrathea business seemed  totally  incomprehensible  toArthur He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going onI only know what Zaphods told me she  whispered  ApparentlyMagrathea  is  some  kind  of  legend  from way back which no oneseriously believes in Bit like Atlantis on  Earth  except  thatthe legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planetsArthur blinked at the screens and felt he was  missing  somethingimportant Suddenly he realized what it wasIs there any tea on this spaceship he askedMore of the planet was unfolding beneath them  as  the  Heart  ofGold  streaked along its orbital path The suns now stood high inthe black sky the  pyrotechnics  of  dawn  were  over  and  thesurface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the commonlight of day  grey dusty and only dimly  contoured  It  lookeddead  and  cold  as a crypt From time to time promising featureswould appear on the distant horizon  ravines  maybe  mountainsmaybe even cities  but as they approached the lines would softenand blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire The planetssurface  was  blurred  by  time by the slow movement of the thinstagnant air that had crept across it for century upon centuryClearly it was very very oldA moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the  grey  landscapemove  beneath  them  The immensity of time worried him he couldfeel it as a presence He cleared his throatWell even supposing it is It is said ZaphodWhich it isnt continued Ford  What  do  you  want  with  itanyway Theres nothing thereNot on the surface said ZaphodAlright just supposing theres

ДжойсУлиссЭпизод Сановитый жирный Бык Маллиган возник из лестничного проема неся в руках чашку с пеной на которой накрест лежали зеркальце и бритва Желтый халат его враспояску слегка вздымался за ним на мягком утреннем ветеркеОн поднял чашку перед собою и возгласил    Остановясь он вгляделся вниз в сумрак винтовой лестницы и грубо крикнул Выходи Клинк Выходи иезуит несчастныйТоржественно он проследовал вперед и взошел на круглую орудийную площадку Обернувшись по сторонам он с важностью троекратно благословил башню окрестный берег и пробуждающиеся горы Потом увидев Стивена Дедала наклонился к нему и начал быстро крестить воздух булькая горлом и подергивая головой Стивен Дедал недовольный и заспанный облокотясь на последнюю ступеньку холодно смотрел на дергающееся булькающее лицо что благословляло его длинное как у лошади и на бестонзурную шевелюру белесую словно окрашенную под светлый дубБык Маллиган заглянул под зеркальце и тут же опять прикрыл чашку По казармам  скомандовал он суровоИ пастырским голосом продолжал Ибо сие о возлюбленные мои есть истинная Христина тело и кровь печенки и селезенки Музыку медленней пожалуйста Господа закройте глаза Минуту Маленькая заминка знаете с белыми шариками Всем помолчатьОн устремил взгляд искоса вверх издал долгий протяжный призывный свист и замер напряженно прислушиваясь Белые ровные зубы койгде поблескивали золотыми крупинками Златоуст Резкий ответный свист дважды прозвучал в тишине Спасибо старина  живо откликнулся он  Так будет чудненько Можешь выключать токОн соскочил с площадки и с важностью поглядел на своего зрителя собирая у ног складки просторного халата Жирное затененное лицо и тяжелый овальный подбородок напоминали средневекового прелата покровителя искусств Довольная улыбка показалась у него на губах Смех да и только  сказал он весело  Это нелепое твое имя как у древнего грекаТкнув пальцем с дружелюбной насмешкой он отошел к парапету посмеиваясь Стивен Дедал поднявшись до конца лестницы устало побрел за ним но не дойдя уселся на край площадки и принялся наблюдать как тот пристроив на парапете зеркальце и обмакнув в пену помазок намыливает шею и щекиВеселый голос Быка Маллигана не умолкал У меня тоже нелепое  Мэйлахи Маллиган два дактиля Но тут звучит чтото эллинское правда ведь Чтото солнечное и резвое как сам бычок Мы непременно должны поехать в Афины Поедешь если я раздобуду у тетушки двадцать фунтовОн положил помазок и в полном восторге воскликнул Это онто поедет Изнуренный иезуитОборвал себя и начал тщательно бриться Послушай Маллиган  промолвил Стивен негромко Да моя радость Долго еще Хейнс будет жить в башнеБык Маллиган явил над правым плечом свежевыбритую щеку Кошмарная личность а  сказал он от души  Этакий толстокожий сакс Он считает что ты не джентльмен Эти мне гнусные англичане Их так и пучит от денег и от запоров Он видите ли из Оксфорда А знаешь Дедал вот у тебято настоящий оксфордский стиль Он все никак тебя не раскусит Нет лучшее тебе имя придумал я Клинк острый клинокОн выбривал с усердием подбородок Всю ночь бредил про какуюто черную пантеру  проговорил Стивен  Где у него ружье Совсем малый спятил  сказал Маллиган  А ты перетрусил не на шутку Еще бы  произнес Стивен с энергией и нарастающим страхом  В кромешном мраке с какимто незнакомцем который стонет и бредит что надо застрелить пантеру Ты спасал тонущих Но я знаешь ли не герой Если он тут останется я ухожуБык Маллиган глядел насупясь на бритву покрытую мыльной пеной Соскочив со своего возвышения он торопливо стал рыться в карманах брюк Драла  пробормотал он сквозь зубыВернувшись к площадке он запустил руку в верхний карман Стивена и сказал Позвольте одолжиться вашим сморкальником вытереть нашу бритвуСтивен покорно дал ему вытащить и развернуть напоказ держа за угол измятый и нечистый платок Бык Маллиган заботливо вытер лезвие Вслед за этим разглядывая платок он объявил Сморкальник барда Новый оттенок в палитру ирландского стихотворца сопливозеленый Почти ощущаешь вкус правдаОн снова поднялся к парапету и бросил долгий взгляд на залив Ветерок шевелил белокурую под светлый дуб шевелюру Господи  сказал он негромко  Как верно названо море у Элджи седая нежная мать Сопливозеленое море Яйцещемящее море Эпи ойнопа понтонАх эти греки Дедал Надо мне тебя обучить Ты должен прочесть их в подлиннике Талатта Талатта  Наша великая и нежная мать Иди сюда и взгляниСтивен встал и подошел к парапету Перегнувшись он посмотрел вниз на воду и на почтовый пароход выходящий из гавани Кингстауна Наша могущественная мать  произнес Бык МаллиганВнезапно он отвел взгляд от моря и большими пытливыми глазами посмотрел Стивену в лицо Моя тетка считает ты убил свою мать  сказал он  Поэтому она бы мне вообще запретила с тобой встречаться Ктото ее убил  сумрачно бросил Стивен Черт побери Клинк уж на колени ты бы мог стать если умирающая мать просит  сказал Бык Маллиган  Я сам гипербореец не хуже тебя Но это ж подумать только мать с последним вздохом умоляет стать на колени помолиться за нее  и ты отказываешься Нет чтото в тебе зловещееОборвал себя и начал намыливать другую щеку Всепрощающая улыбка тронула его губы Но бесподобный комедиант  шепнул он тихонько  Клинк бесподобнейший из комедиантовОн брился плавно и осмотрительно в истовом молчанииСтивен поставив локоть на шершавый гранит подперев лоб ладонью неподвижно смотрел на обтерханные края своего черного лоснистого рукава Боль что не была еще болью любви саднила сердце его Во сне безмолвно она явилась ему после смерти ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева а дыхание когда она с немым укором склонилась над ним веяло сыростью могильного тлена Поверх ветхой манжеты он видел море которое сытый голос превозносил как великую и нежную мать Кольцо залива и горизонта заполняла тусклозеленая влагаБелый фарфоровый сосуд у ее смертного одра заполняла тягучая зеленая желчь которую она с громкими стонами извергала из своей гниющей печени в приступах мучительной рвотыБык Маллиган заново обтер бритву Эх песбедолага  с участием вздохнул он  Надо бы выдать тебе рубашку да хоть пару сморкальников А как те штаны что купили с рук Как будто впору  отвечал СтивенБык Маллиган атаковал ложбинку под нижней губой Смех да и только  произнес он довольно  Верней будет с ног Дознайся какая там пьянь заразная таскала их У меня есть отличная пара серые в узкую полоску Ты бы в них выглядел потрясающе Нет кроме шуток Клинк Ты очень недурно смотришься когда прилично одет Спасибо  ответил Стивен  Если они серые я их не могу носить Он их не может носить  сказал Бык Маллиган своему отражению в зеркале  Этикет значит этикет Он мать родную убил но серые брюки ни за что не оденетОн сложил аккуратно бритву и легкими касаньями пальцев ощупал гладкую кожуСтивен перевел взгляд с залива на жирное лицо с мутноголубыми бегающими глазами Этот малый с кем я сидел в Корабле прошлый вечер  сказал Бык Маллиган  уверяет у тебя ппс Он в желтом доме работает у Конопли Нормана Прогрессивный паралич со слабоумиемОн описал зеркальцем полукруг повсюду просверкав эту весть солнечными лучами уже сияющими над морем Изогнутые бритые губы кончики блестящих белых зубов смеялись Смех овладел всем его сильным и ладным телом На полюбуйсяка на себя горебард  сказал онСтивен наклонился и глянул в подставленное зеркало расколотое кривой трещиной Волосы дыбом Так взор его и прочих видит меня Кто мне выбрал это лицо Эту паршивую шкуру псабедолаги Оно тоже спрашивает меня Я его стянул у служанки из комнаты  поведал Бык Маллиган  Ей в самый раз такое Тетушка ради Мэйлахи всегда нанимает неказистых Не введи его во искушение И зовутто УрсулойСнова залившись смехом он убрал зеркальце изпод упорного взгляда Стивена Ярость Калибана не видящего в зеркале своего отражения  изрек он Как жалко Уайльд не дожил на тебя поглядетьОтступив и показывая на зеркало Стивен с горечью произнес Вот символ ирландского искусства Треснувшее зеркало служанкиНеожиданно и порывисто Бык Маллиган подхватил Стивена под руку и зашагал с ним вокруг башни позвякивая бритвой и зеркальцем засунутыми в карман Грех тебя так дразнить правда Клинк  сказал он дружески  Видит бог в голове у тебя побольше чем у них всехЕще выпад отбит Скальпель художника страшит его как меня  докторский Хладная сталь пера Треснувшее зеркало служанки Ты это скажи тому олуху из Оксфорда да вытяни из него гинею Он весь провонял деньгами и считает что ты не джентльмен А у самого папаша набил мошну сбывая негритосам слабительное а может еще на каких делишках Эх Клинк если бы мы с тобой действовали сообща уж мы бы коечто сделали для нашего острова Эллинизировали бы егоРука Крэнли Его рука И подумать только ты вынужден побираться у этих свиней Я одинединственный понимаю что ты за человек Почему ж ты так мало мне доверяешь Изза чего все воротишь нос Изза Хейнса Да пусть только пикнет я притащу Сеймура и мы ему закатим трепку еще похлеще чем досталась Клайву КемпторпуКрики юных богатеньких голосов в квартире Клайва Кемпторпа Бледнолицые держатся за бока от хохота хватаются друг за друга ох умора Обри бережно весть эту ей передай Сейчас помру В изрезанной рубашке вьющейся лентами по воздуху в съехавших до полу штанах он спотыкаясь скачет вокруг стола а за ним Эйдс из Магдалины с портновскими ножницами Мордочка ошалелого теленка позолоченная вареньем Не надо не сдирайте штаны Не набрасывайтесь на меня как бешеныеКрики из распахнутого окна вспугивают вечер во дворе колледжа Глухой садовник в фартуке замаскированный лицом Мэтью Арнольда продвигается по темному газону с косилкой вглядываясь в танцующий рой травинокНам самим новое язычество омфал Ладно пусть остается  сказал Стивен  Такто он ничего только по ночам Тогда в чем же дело  наседал Бык Маллиган  Давай рожай Ято ведь напрямик с тобой Что у тебя такое против меняОни остановились глядя туда где тупая оконечность мыса БрэйХед покоилась на воде словно голова спящего кита Стивен осторожно высвободил руку Ты хочешь чтобы я сказал тебе  спросил он Да в чем там дело  повторил Бык Маллиган  Я ничего не припоминаюГоворя это он в упор посмотрел на Стивена Легкий ветерок пробежал по его лицу вороша светлую спутанную шевелюру и зажигая в глазах серебряные искорки беспокойстваСтивен удручаясь собственным голосом сказал Ты помнишь как я пришел к тебе домой в первый раз после смерти материБык Маллиган мгновенно нахмурившись отвечал Как Где Убей не могу припомнить Я запоминаю только идеи и ощущения Ну и что Чего там стряслось бога ради Ты готовил чай  продолжал Стивен  а я пошел на кухню за кипятком Из комнат вышла твоя мать и с ней ктото из гостей Она спросила кто у тебя Ну  не отступал Бык Маллиган  А я что сказал Я уже все забыл А ты сказал  ответил Стивен ему  Да так просто Дедал у которого мамаша подохлаБык Маллиган покраснел и стал казаться от этого моложе и привлекательней Я так сказал  переспросил он  И что же Что тут такогоНервным движением он стряхнул свое замешательство А что потвоему смерть  спросил он  твоей матери или твоя или положим моя Ты видел только как умирает твоя мать А я каждый день вижу как они отдают концы и в Ричмонде и в Скорбящей да после их крошат на потроха в анатомичке Это и называется подох ничего больше И не о чем говорить Ты вот не соизволил стать на колени и помолиться за свою мать когда она просила тебя на смертном одре А почему Да потому что в тебе эта проклятая иезуитская закваска только она проявляется наоборот По мне тут одна падаль и пустая комедия Ее лобные доли уже не действуют Она называет доктора сэр Питер Тизл и хочет нарвать лютиков с одеяла Уж не перечь ей вотвот все кончится Ты сам не исполнил ее предсмертную просьбу а теперь дуешься на меня что я не скулил как наемный плакальщик от Лалуэтта Абсурд Допустим я и сказал так Но я вовсе не хотел оскорбить память твоей материЕго речь вернула ему самоуверенность Стивен скрывая зияющие раны оставленные словами в его сердце как можно суше сказал Я и не говорю что это оскорбляет мою мать Так что же тогда  спросил Бык Маллиган Это оскорбляет меня  был ответБык Маллиган круто повернулся на каблуках Нет невозможный субъект  воскликнул онИ пошел прочь быстрым шагом вдоль парапета Стивен остался на месте недвижно глядя на мыс и на спокойную гладь залива Море и мыс сейчас подернулись дымкой В висках стучала кровь застилая взор и он чувствовал как лихорадочно горят его щекиГромкий голос позвал снизу из башни Маллиган вы где наверху Сейчас иду  откликнулся Бык МаллиганОн обернулся к Стивену и сказал Взгляни на море Что ему до всех оскорблений Бросайка лучше Лойолу Клинк и двигаем вниз Наш сакс поджидает уже свой беконГолова его задержалась на миг над лестницей вровень с крышей И не хандри изза этого целый день У меня же семь пятниц на неделеОставь скорбные думыГолова скрылась но мерный голос продолжал опускаясь доноситься из лестничного проемаНе прячь глаза и не скорбиНад горькой тайною любвиТам Фергус правит в полный ростВладыка медных колесницВ мирном спокойствии утра тени лесов неслышно проплывали от лестничного проема к морю туда куда он глядел У берега и мористей водная гладь белела следами стремительных легких стоп Морской волны белеет грудьПопарные сплетения ударений Рука перебирающая струны арфы рождает сплетения аккордов Слитносплетенных словес словно волн белогрудых мерцаньеОблако медленно наползает на солнце и гуще делается в тени зелень залива Он был за спиной у него сосуд горьких вод Песня Фергуса Я пел ее оставшись дома один приглушая долгие сумрачные аккорды Дверь к ней была открыта она хотела слышать меня Безмолвно с жалостью и благоговением я приблизился к ее ложу Она плакала на своем убогом одре Над этими словами Стивен над горькой тайною любвиГде же теперь Ее секреты в запертом ящичке старые веера из перьев бальные книжечки с бахромой пропитанные мускусом убор из янтарных бус Когда она была девочкой у ее окошка висела на солнце клетка с птицей Она видела старика Ройса в представлении Свирепый турка и вместе со всеми смеялась когда он распевалОткрою вамЧто рад бы самЯ невидимкой статьМимолетные радости заботливо сложенные надушенные мускусомНе прячь глаза и не скорбиСложены в памяти природы вместе с ее детскими игрушками Скорбные воспоминания осаждают его разум Стакан воды из крана на кухне когда она собиралась к причастию Яблоко с сахаром внутри испеченное для нее на плите в темный осенний вечер Ее изящные ногти окрашенные кровью вшей с детских рубашонокВо сне безмолвно она явилась ему ее иссохшее тело в темных погребальных одеждах окружал запах воска и розового дерева ее дыхание когда она склонилась над ним с неслышными тайными словами веяло сыростью могильного тленаЕе стекленеющие глаза уставились из глубин смерти поколебать и сломить мою душу На меня одного Призрачная свеча освещает ее агонию Призрачные блики на искаженном мукой лице Громко раздается ее дыхание хриплое прерывающееся от ужаса и став на колени все молятся Взгляд ее на мне повергнуть меня            Упырь ТрупоедНет мать Отпусти меня Дай мне жить Эгей КлинкГолос Быка Маллигана раздался певуче в глубине башни приблизился долетев от лестницы позвал снова Стивен еще содрогаясь от вопля своей души услышал теплый щедрый солнечный свет и в воздухе за своей спиной дружеские слова Будь паинькой спускайся Дедал Завтрак готов Хейнс извиняется за то что мешал нам спать Все улажено Иду  сказал Стивен оборачиваясь Давай Христа ради  говорил Маллиган  И ради меня и ради всеобщего благаЕго голова нырнула и вынырнула Я ему передал про твой символ ирландского искусства Говорит очень остроумно Вытяни из него фунт идет То бишь гинею Мне заплатят сегодня  сказал Стивен В школьной шарашке  осведомился Маллиган  А сколько Четыре фунта Одолжи нам один Как угодно  отвечал Стивен Четыре сверкающих соверена  вскричал с восторгом Бык Маллиган  Устроим роскошный выпивон на зависть всем раздруидам Четыре всемогущих соверенаВоздев руки он затопал по каменным ступеням вниз фальшиво распевая с лондонским простонародным акцентомВеселье будет допозднаМы хлопнем виски и винаВ день КоронацииМы славно покутимВеселье будет допозднаИ все мы покутимЛучи солнца веселились над морем Забытая никелевая чашка для бритья поблескивала на парапете Почему я должен ее относить Может оставить тут на весь день памятником забытой дружбеОн подошел к ней подержал с минуту в руках осязая ее прохладу чувствуя запах липкой пены с торчащим в ней помазком Так прежде я носил кадило в Клонгоузе Сейчас я другой и всетаки еще тот же Опять слуга Прислужник слугиВ мрачном сводчатом помещении внутри башни фигура в халате бодро сновала у очага то скрывая то открывая желтое его пламя Мягкий дневной свет падал двумя снопами через высокие оконца на вымощенный плитами пол и там где снопы встречались плыло медленно вращаясь облако дыма от горящего угля и горелого жира Этак мы задохнемся  заметил Бык Маллиган  Хейнс вы не откроете дверьСтивен поставил бритвенную чашку на шкафчик Долговязый человек сидевший на подвесной койке направился к порогу и отворил внутреннюю дверь А у вас есть ключ  спросил голос Ключ у Дедала  отозвался Бык Маллиган  Черти лохматые я уже задыхаюсьНе отрывая взгляда от очага он взревел Клинк Ключ в скважине  сказал Стивен подходя ближеКлюч с резким скрежетом дважды повернулся в замке и тяжелая наружная дверь впустила долгожданные свет и воздух Хейнс остановился в дверях глядя наружу Стивен придвинул к столу свой чемодан поставив его торчком и уселся ждать Бык Маллиган шваркнул жарево на блюдо рядом с собой Потом отнес блюдо и большой чайник к столу поставил и вздохнул с облегчением Ах я вся таю  произнес он  как сказала свечка когда Но  тес Про это не будем Клинк проснись Подавай хлеб масло мед Присоединяйтесь Хейнс Кормежка готова Благослови Господи нас и эти дары твои Черт побери молока нетСтивен достал из шкафчика масленку хлеб и горшочек с медом Бык Маллиган усевшись вскипел внезапным негодованием Что за бардак  возмутился он  Я ж ей сказал  прийти в начале девятого Можно и без молока обойтись  сказал Стивен  В шкафчике есть лимон Да пошел ты со своими парижскими замашками  отвечал Бык Маллиган  Я хочу молочка из СэндикоуваХейнс направляясь к ним от дверей сообщил Идет ваша молочница с молоком Благодать божия  воскликнул Бык Маллиган вскакивая со стула  Присаживайтесь Наливайте чай Сахар в пакете А с треклятой яичницей я больше не желаю возитьсяОн кое как раскромсал жарево на блюде и раскидал его по трем тарелкам приговаривая        Хейнс сел и принялся разливать чай Кладу всем по два куска  сказал он  Слушайте Маллиган какой вы крепкий завариваетеБык Маллиган нарезая хлеб щедрыми ломтями замурлыкал умильным старушечьим голоском Как надоть мне чай заваривать уж я так заварю говаривала матушка Гроган А надоть нужду справлять уж так справлю Боже правый вот это чай  сказал ХейнсБык Маллиган нарезая хлеб так же умильно продолжал Уж такой мой обычай миссис Кахилл  это она говорит А миссис Кахилл на это Ахти сударыня только упаси вас Господи делать оба дела в одну посудину На кончике ножа он протянул каждому из сотрапезников по толстому ломтю хлеба Это же фольклор  сказал он очень серьезно  это для вашей книги Хейнс Пять строчек текста и десять страниц комментариев насчет фольклора и рыбообразных божеств Дандрама Издано сестрамиколдуньями в год великого ураганаОн обернулся к Стивену и подняв брови спросил его с крайней заинтересованностью Не можете ли напомнить коллега где говорится про посудину матушки Гроган в Мабиногионе или в упанишадах Отнюдь не уверен  солидно отвечал Стивен В самом деле  продолжал Бык Маллиган прежним тоном  А отчего же будьте любезны Мне думается  сказал Стивен не прерывая еды  этого не найти ни в Мабиногионе ни за его пределами Матушка Гроган по всей вероятности состоит в родстве с Мэри ЭннБык Маллиган расплылся от удовольствия Прелестно  произнес он сюсюкающим и слащавым голосом показывая белые зубы и жмурясь довольно  Вы так полагаете Совершенно прелестноЗатем вдруг нарочито нахмурясь он хрипло скрипуче зарычал рьяно нарезая новые ломтиНа старуху Мэри ЭннЕй плевать с высоких стенНо задравши свой подолНабив рот яичницей он жевал и мычалВ дверях заслоняя свет появилась фигура женщины Молоко сэр Заходите сударыня  сказал Маллиган  Клинк подайка кувшинСтарушка вошла и остановилась около Стивена Славное утречко сэр  сказала она  Слава Богу Комукому  спросил Маллиган поглядев на нее  Ах да конечноСтивен протянув руку за спину достал из шкафчика молочный кувшин Наши островитяне  заметил Маллиган Хейнсу как бы вскользь  нередко поминают сборщика крайней плоти Сколько сэр  спросила старушка Одну кварту  ответил СтивенОн смотрел как она наливает в мерку а оттуда в кувшин густое белое молоко не свое Старые сморщенные груди Она налила еще мерку с избыткомДревняя и таинственная она явилась из утреннего мира быть может вестницей Наливая молоко она расхваливала его В сочных лугах чуть свет она уже доила сидя на корточках ведьма на поганке скрюченные пальцы проворны у набухшего вымени Мычанием встречала ее привычный приход скотинка шелковая от росы Бедная старушка шелковая коровка  такие прозвища давались ей в старину Старухастранница низший род бессмертных служащая своему захватчику и своему беззаботному обманщику познавшая измену обоих вестница тайны утра Служить или укорять он не знал однако гнушался заискивать перед нею И впрямь прекрасное сударыня  согласился Бык Маллиган наливая им в чашки молоко Вы сэр отведайте  сказала онаУступая ей он сделал глоток Если бы все мы могли питаться такой вот здоровой пищей  объявил он звучно  в этой стране не было бы столько гнилых зубов и гнилых кишок А то живем в болоте едим дешевую дрянь а улицы вымощены навозом пылью и чахоточными плевками А вы сэр на доктора учитесь  спросила старушка Да сударыня  ответил Бык МаллиганСтивен слушал храня презрительное молчание Она покорно внимает зычному голосу своего костоправа и врачевателя меня она знать не знаетГолосу который отпустит ей грехи и помажет для погребения ее тело кроме женских нечистых чресл сотворенное из плоти мужской не по подобию Божию в добычу змею И тому голосу что сейчас заставляет ее умолкнуть с удивлением озираясь Вы понимаете что он говорит  осведомился у нее Стивен Это вы пофранцузски сэр  спросила старушка ХейнсаХейнс с апломбом обратил к ней новую тираду еще длинней Это поирландски  объяснил Бык Маллиган  Вы гэльский знаете Я так и думала по звуку это ирландский  сказала она  А вы не с запада сэр Я англичанин  ответил Хейнс Он англичанин  повторил Бык Маллиган  и он считает в Ирландии надо говорить поирландски Нет спору надо  сказала старушка  мне и самой стыд что не умею на нашем языке А люди умные говорят языкто великий Великий  это не то слово  заявил Бык Маллиган  Он абсолютно великолепен Плесни нам еще чайку Клинк Не хотите ли чашечку сударыня Нет сэр спасибо  отвечала старушка повесив на руку бидон и собираясь идтиХейнс обратился к ней А счет у вас есть Маллиган надо бы заплатить верноСтивен снова наполнил чашки Счет сэр  неуверенно переспросила она  Это значит семь дней по пинте по два пенса это семь раз по два это шиллинг два пенса да эти три дня по кварте по четыре пенса будет три кварты это выходит шиллинг да там один и два всего два и два сэрБык Маллиган вздохнул и отправив в рот горбушку густо намазанную маслом с обеих сторон вытянул вперед ноги и начал рыться в карманах Платить подобает с любезным видом  сказал улыбаясь ХейнсСтивен налил третью чашку слегка закрасив ложечкой чая густое жирное молоко Бык Маллиган выудил из кармана флорин и повертев его в пальцах воскликнул О чудоОн пододвинул флорин по столу к старушке приговаривая Радость моя для тебя все что имею отдамСтивен вложил монету в ее нежадную руку За нами еще два пенса  заметил он Это не к спеху сэр  уверяла она убирая монету  Совсем не к спеху Всего вам доброго сэрПоклонившись она ушла напутствуемая нежным речитативом Быка Маллигана Я бы с восторгом весь мирК милым повергнул стопамОн обернулся к Стивену и сказал Серьезно Дедал Я совсем на мели Беги в свою школьную шарашку да принеси оттуда малость деньжонок Сегодня бардам положено пить и пировать Ирландия ожидает что в этот день каждый выполнит свой долг Что до меня  заметил Хейнс поднимаясь  то я должен сегодня посетить вашу национальную библиотеку Сперва поплавать  заявил Бык МаллиганОн обернулся к Стивену и самым учтивым тоном спросил Не сегодня ли Клинк день твоего ежемесячного омовенияИ пояснил обращаясь к Хейнсу Оный нечистый бард имеет правило мыться один раз в месяц Всю Ирландию омывает Гольфстрим  промолвил Стивен поливая хлеб струйкой медаХейнс отозвался из угла легким узлом повязывая шейный платок под открытым воротом спортивной рубашки Я буду собирать ваши изречения если вы позволитеОбращено ко мне Они моются банятся оттираются Жагала сраму Совесть А пятно все на месте Это отлично сказано что треснувшее зеркало служанки  символ ирландского искусстваБык Маллиган толкнув Стивена ногой под столом задушевно пообещал Погодите Хейнс вот вы еще послушаете его о Гамлете Нет я в самом деле намерен  продолжал Хейнс обращаясь к Стивену  Я как раз думал на эту тему когда пришло это ветхое создание А я чтонибудь заработаю на этом  спросил СтивенХейнс рассмеялся и сказал снимая мягкую серую шляпу с крюка на котором была подвешена койка Чего не знаю того не знаюНеторопливо он направился к двери Бык Маллиган перегнулся к Стивену и грубо с нажимом прошипел Не можешь без своих штучек Для чего ты это ему А что  возразил Стивен  Задача  раздобыть денег У кого У него или у молочницы Помоему орел или решка Я про тебя ему уши прожужжал  не отставал Бык Маллиган  а тут извольте ты со своим вшивым злопамятством да замогильными иезуитскими шуточками У меня нет особой надежды  заметил Стивен  как на него так и на нееБык Маллиган трагически вздохнул и положил руку Стивену на плечо Лишь на меня Клинк  произнес онИ совсем другим голосом добавил Честно признаться я и сам считаю ты прав На хрена они кроме этого сдались Чего ты их не морочишь как я Пошли они все к ляду Надо выбираться из этого бардакаОн встал важно распустил пояс и совлек с себя свой халат произнося отрешенным тоном И был Маллиган разоблачен от одежд егоСодержимое карманов он выложил на стол со словами Вот тебе твой соплюшникИ надевая жесткий воротничок и строптивый галстук стыдил их и укорял а с ними и запутавшуюся часовую цепочку Руки его нырнув в чемодан шарили там покуда он требовал себе чистый носовой платок Жагала сраму Клянусь богом мы же обязаны поддерживать репутацию Желаю бордовые перчатки и зеленые башмаки Противоречие Я противоречу себе Ну что же значит я противоречу себе Ветреник Малахия Его говорливые руки метнули мягкий черный снаряд И вот твоя шляпа в стиле Латинского КварталаСтивен поймал ее и надел на голову Хейнс окликнул их от дверей Друзья вы двигаетесь Я готов  отозвался Бык Маллиган идя к двери  Пошли Клинк Кажется ты уже все доел после насОтрешенный и важный проследовал он к порогу не без прискорбия сообщая И пойдя вон плюхнулся с горкиСтивен взяв ясеневую тросточку стоявшую у стены тронулся за ним следом Выйдя на лестницу он притянул неподатливую стальную дверь и запер ее Гигантский ключ сунул во внутренний карманУ подножия лестницы Бык Маллиган спросил А ты ключ взял Да он у меня  отвечал Стивен перегоняя ихОн шел вперед За спиной у себя он слышал как Бык Маллиган сбивает тяжелым купальным полотенцем верхушки папоротников или трав Кланяйтесь сэр Да как вы смеете сэрХейнс спросил А вы платите аренду за башню Двенадцать фунтов  ответил Бык Маллиган Военному министру  добавил Стивен через плечоОни приостановились покуда Хейнс разглядывал башню Потом он заметил Зимой унылое зрелище надо думать Как она называется Мартелло Их выстроили по указанию Билли Питта  сказал Бык Маллиган  когда с моря угрожали французы Но наша  это омфал И какие же у вас идеи о Гамлете  спросил у Стивена Хейнс О нет  воскликнул страдальчески Бык Маллиган  Я этого не выдержу я вам не Фома Аквинат измысливший пятьдесят пять причин Дайте мне сперва принять пару кружекОн обернулся к Стивену аккуратно одергивая лимонный жилет Тебе ж самому для такого надо не меньше трех правда Клинк Это уж столько ждет  ответил тот равнодушно  может и еще подождать Вы разжигаете мое любопытство  любезно заметил Хейнс  Тут какойнибудь парадокс Фу  сказал Маллиган  Мы уже переросли Уайльда и парадоксы Все очень просто Он с помощью алгебры доказывает что внук Гамлета  дедушка Шекспира а сам он призрак собственного отца Каккак  переспросил Хейнс показывая было на Стивена  Вот он самБык Маллиган накинул полотенце на шею наподобие столы патера и корчась от смеха шепнул на ухо Стивену О тень Клинкастаршего Иафет в поисках отца Мы по утрам усталые  сказал Стивен Хейнсу  А это довольно долго рассказыватьБык Маллиган снова зашагавший вперед воздел руки к небу Только священная кружка способна развязать Дедалу язык  объявил он Я хочу сказать  Хейнс принялся объяснять Стивену на ходу  эта башня и эти скалы мне чемто напоминают Эльсинор Выступ утеса грозного нависшего над морем не так лиБык Маллиган на миг неожиданно обернулся к Стивену но ничего не сказал В этот сверкнувший безмолвный миг Стивен словно увидел свой облик в пыльном дешевом трауре рядом с их яркими одеяниями Это удивительная история  сказал Хейнс опять останавливая ихГлаза светлые как море под свежим ветром еще светлей твердые и сторожкие Правитель морей он смотрел на юг через пустынный залив где лишь маячил смутно на горизонте дымный плюмаж далекого пакетбота да парусник лавировал у банки Маглине Я гдето читал богословское истолкование  произнес он в задумчивости  Идея Отца и Сына Сын стремящийся к воссоединению с ОтцомБык Маллиган немедля изобразил ликующую физиономию с ухмылкою до ушейОн поглядел на них блаженно разинув красивый рот и глаза его в которых он тут же пригасил всякую мысль моргали с полоумным весельем Он помотал тудасюда болтающейся башкой болванчика тряся полями круглой панамы и запел дурашливым бездумно веселым голосомЯ юноша странный каких поискатьОтец мой был птицей еврейкою  матьС Иосифомплотником жить я не сталБродяжничал и на Голгофу попалОн предостерегающе поднял палецА кто говорит я не бог тем плутамВинца что творю из воды я не дамПусть пьют они воду и тайна яснаКак снова я воду творю из винаБыстрым прощальным жестом он подергал за Стивенову тросточку и устремился вперед к самому краю утеса хлопая себя по бокам как будто плавниками или крыльями готовящимися взлететь и продолжая свое пениеПрощай же и речи мои запишиО том что воскрес я везде расскажиМне плоть не помеха коль скоро я богЛечу я на небо Прощай же дружокВыделывая антраша он подвигался на их глазах к сорокафутовому провалу махая крылоподобными руками легко подскакивая и шляпа ветреника колыхалась на свежем ветру доносившем до них его отрывистые птичьи крикиХейнс который посмеивался весьма сдержанно идя рядом со Стивеном заметил Мне кажется тут не стоит смеяться Он сильно богохульствует Впрочем я лично не из верующих С другой стороны его веселье както придает всему безобидность не правда ли Как это у него называется Иосифплотник Баллада об Иисусешутнике  буркнул Стивен Так вы это раньше слышали  спросил Хейнс Каждый день три раза после еды  последовал сухой ответ Но вы самито не из верующих  продолжал расспрашивать Хейнс  Я хочу сказать верующих в узком смысле слова Творение из ничего чудеса Бог как личность Мне думается у этого слова всего один смысл  сказал СтивенОстановясь Хейнс вынул серебряный портсигар с мерцающим зеленым камнем Нажав на пружину крышки большим пальцем он раскрыл его и протянул Стивену Спасибо  отозвался тот беря сигаретуХейнс взял другую себе и снова защелкнул крышку Спрятав обратно портсигар он вынул из жилетного кармана никелированную трутницу тем же манером раскрыл ее прикурил и заслонив язычок пламени ладонью подставил Стивену Да конечно  проговорил он когда они пошли дальше  Вы либо веруете либо нет верно Лично я не мог бы переварить идею личного Бога Надеюсь вы ее не придерживаетесь Вы видите во мне  произнес Стивен мрачно и недовольно  пример ужасающего вольнодумстваОн шел выжидая продолжения разговора держа сбоку ясеневую тросточкуЕе кованый наконечник легко чертил по тропинке поскрипывая у ног Мой дружочек следом за мной с тоненьким зовом Стиииииивии Волнистая линия вдоль тропинки Они пройдут по ней вечером затемно возвращаясь Он хочет ключ Ключ мой я плачу аренду Но я ем хлеб его что горестен устамОтдай и ключ Все отдай Он спросит про него По глазам было видно В конечном счете  начал ХейнсСтивен обернулся и увидал что холодный взгляд смеривший его был не таким уж недобрым В конечном счете мне кажется вы способны достичь свободы Похоже что вы сами себе господин Я слуга двух господ  отвечал Стивен  или если хотите госпож англичанки и итальянки Итальянки  переспросил ХейнсПолоумная королева старая и ревнивая На колени передо мной А некто третий  продолжал Стивен  желает чтобы я был у него на побегушках Итальянки  спросил снова Хейнс  Что это значит Британской империи  пояснил Стивен покраснев  и Римской святой соборной и апостольской церквиПрежде чем заговорить Хейнс снял с нижней губы приставшие крошки табака Вполне понимаю вас  спокойно заметил он  Я бы даже сказал для ирландца естественно так думать Мы в Англии сознаем что обращались с вами несправедливо Но повинна тут видимо историяГордые полновластные титулы прозвучали в памяти Стивена победным звоном медных колоколов        неспешный рост вызревание догматов и обрядов как его собственных заветных мыслей химия звезд Апостольский символ в мессе папы Марцеллия голоса сливаются в мощное утверждающее соло и под их пение недреманный ангел церкви воинствующей обезоруживал ересиархов и грозил имОрды ересей в скособоченных митрах разбегаются наутек Фотий орава зубоскалов средь коих и Маллиган Арий воевавший всю жизнь против единосущия Сына Отцу Валентин что гнушался земным естеством Христа и хитроумный ересиарх из Африки Савеллий по чьим утверждениям Отец Сам был собственным СыномСлова которые только что сказал Маллиган зубоскаля над чужеземцемПустое зубоскальство Неизбежная пустота ожидает их всех что ткут ветер угрозу обезоруживанье и поражение несут им стройные боевые порядки ангелов церкви воинство Михаила в пору раздоров всегда встающее на ее защиту с копьями и щитамиБраво бис Продолжительные аплодисменты     Я разумеется британец  продолжал голос Хейнса  и мыслю я соответственно К тому же мне вовсе не хочется увидеть свою страну в руках немецких евреев Боюсь что сейчас это главная опасность для нашей нацииДвое наблюдая стояли на краю обрыва  делец и лодочник Плывет в БаллокЛодочник с неким пренебрежением кивнул на север залива Там будет саженей пять  сказал он  Туда его и вынесет после часу когда прилив начнется Нынче девятый деньПро утопленника Парус кружит по пустынной бухте поджидая когда вынырнет раздутый мешок и обернет к солнцу солью беленное вспученное лицоА вот и яИзвилистой тропкой они спустились к неширокому заливчику Бык Маллиган стоял на камне без пиджака отшпиленный галстук струился по ветру за плечом Поблизости от него юноша держась за выступ скалы медленно полягушачьи разводил зелеными ногами в студенистой толще воды А брат с тобой Мэйлахи Да нет он в Уэстмите у Бэннонов Все еще Мне Бэннон прислал открытку Говорит подцепил себе там одну молоденькую Фотодевочка он ее так зовет Заснял значит С короткой выдержкойБык Маллиган уселся снять башмаки Изза выступа скалы высунулось красное отдувающееся лицо Пожилой мужчина вылез на камни вода блестела на его лысине с седоватым венчиком вода струилась по груди по брюху капала с черных мешковатых трусовБык Маллиган посторонился пропуская его и бросив взгляд на Хейнса и Стивена ногтем большого пальца набожно перекрестил себе лоб уста и грудную клетку А Сеймур опять в городе  сказал юноша ухватившись снова за выступ  Медицину побоку решил в армию Да иди ты  хмыкнул Бык Маллиган На той неделе уже в казарму А ты знаешь ту рыженькую из Карлайла Лили Знаю Прошлый вечер на пирсе с ним обжималась У папаши денег до черта Может она залетела Это ты Сеймура спроси Сеймур  кровопускающий офицер  объявил Бык МаллиганКивнув самому себе он стянул с ног брюки выпрямился и изрек избитую истину Рыжие бабы блудливы как козыВстревоженно оборвав принялся щупать свои бока под вздувшейся от ветра рубашкой У меня нет двенадцатого ребра  возопил он  Я  Беззубый Клинк и я мы сверхчеловекиОн выпутался из рубашки и кинул ее к вороху остальной одежды Здесь залезаешь Мэйлахи Ага Дайка местечко на кроватиЮноша в воде оттолкнулся назад и в два сильных ровных гребка выплыл на середину заливчика Хейнс с сигаретой присел на камень А вы не будете  спросил Бык Маллиган Попозже  отвечал Хейнс  После завтрака не сразуСтивен повернулся идти Я ухожу Маллиган  сказал он А дайка тот ключ Клинк  сказал Бык Маллиган  мою рубашку прижатьСтивен протянул ему ключ Бык Маллиган положил его на ворох одежды И двухпенсовик на пинту Кидай туда жеСтивен кинул два пенса на мягкий ворох Одеваются раздеваются Бык Маллиган выпрямившись сложив перед грудью руки торжественно произнес Крадущий у бедного дает взаймы Господу Так говорил ЗаратустраЖирное тело нырнуло в воду Еще увидимся  сказал Хейнс повернувшись к уходящему Стивену и улыбаясь необузданности ирландцевБычьих рогов конских копыт и улыбки сакса В Корабле  крикнул Бык Маллиган  В полпервого Ладно  ответил СтивенОн шел по тропинке что вилась вверх    Седой нимб священника за скалой куда тот скромно удалился для одевания Сегодня я не буду здесь ночевать Домой идти тоже не могуЗов протяжный и мелодичный донесся до него с моря На повороте тропинки он помахал рукой Голос донесся снова Лоснящаяся темная голова тюленья далеко от берега круглаяЗахватчикЭпизод  Кокрейн ты скажи Какой город послал за ним Тарент сэр Правильно А потом Потом было сражение сэр Правильно А гдеМальчуган с пустым выражением уставился в пустоту окнаБасни дочерей памяти Но ведь чем то и непохоже на басни памяти Тогда  фраза сказанная в сердцах шум Блейковых крыл избытка Слышу как рушатся пространства обращаются в осколки стекло и камень и время охвачено синебагровым пламенем конца Что же нам остается Я позабыл место сэр В  году до нашей эры Аскулум  бросил Стивен заглянув в книгу с рубцами кровопролитий Да сэр И он сказал еще одна такая победа  и мы погиблиВот эту фразу мир и запомнил Утеха для скудоумных Над усеянной телами равниной опершись на копье генерал обращается с холма к офицерам Любой генерал к любым офицерам А те внимают Теперь ты Армстронг  сказал Стивен  А каков был конец Пирра Конец Пирра сэр Я знаю сэр Спросите меня сэр  вызвался Комин Нет ты обожди Армстронг Ты чтонибудь знаешь о ПирреВ ранце у Армстронга уютно притаился кулек с вялеными фигами Время от времени он разминал их в ладонях и отправлял потихоньку в рот Крошки приставшие к кожице на губах Подслащенное мальчишеское дыханиеЗажиточная семья гордятся что старший сын во флоте Виксроуд Долки О Пирре сэр Пирр  это пирсВсе засмеялись Визгливый злорадный смех без веселья Армстронг обвел взглядом класс дурашливая ухмылка на профиле Сейчас совсем разойдутся знают что мне их не приструнить а плату их папаши внесли Тогда объясни  сказал Стивен касаясь плеча мальчугана книжкой  что это такое пирс Ну пирс сэр  тянул Армстронг  Такая штука над морем Вроде как мост В Кингстауне пирс сэрКое кто засмеялся снова без веселья но со значением Двое на задней парте начали перешептываться Да Они знали никогда не изведав никогда не были невинны Все Он с завистью оглядел их лица Эдит Этель Герти Лили Похожи на этих дыхание тоже подслащенное от чая с вареньем браслеты звякают во время возни Кингстаунский пирс  повторил Стивен  Да несбывшийся мостИх взгляды смутились от его слов Как это сэр  спросил Комин  Мост он же через рекуХейнсу в его цитатник Не для этих ушей Вечером среди пьянки и пустословия пронзить словно пирс воду ровную гладь его ума А что в том Шут при господском дворе благоволимый и презираемый добился от господина милостивой похвалы Почему все они выбрали эту роль Не только ведь ради ласки и поощрения Для них тоже история  это сказка давно навязшая в ушах а своя страна  закладная лавкаРазве Пирр не пал в Аргосе от руки старой ведьмы а Юлия Цезаря не закололи кинжалом Их уже не изгнать из памяти Время поставило на них свою мету и заключило сковав в пространстве что занимали уничтоженные ими бесчисленные возможности Но были ль они возможны если их так и не было Или то лишь было возможным что состоялось Тките ветра ткачи Сэр а расскажите нам чтонибудь Ага сэр про привидения Где мы остановились тут  спросил Стивен открывая другую книгу Оставь рыданья  сказал Комин Ну давай Толбот А историю сэр Потом  сказал Стивен  Давай ТолботСмуглый мальчуган раскрыл книгу и ловко приладил ее за укрытием своего ранца Он начал читать стихотворение запинаясь и часто подглядывая в текстОставь рыданья о пастух оставь рыданьяЛикид не умирал напрасна скорбь твояХотя над ним волны сомкнулись очертаньяТогда это должно быть движением актуализация возможного как таковогоФраза Аристотеля сложилась из бормотанья ученика и поплыла вдаль в ученую тишину библиотеки Святой Женевьевы где он читал огражден от греховного Парижа вечер за вечером Рядом хрупкий сиамец штудировал учебник стратегии Вокруг меня насыщенные и насыщающиеся мозги  пришпиленные под лампочками слабо подрагивающие щупиками  а во тьме моего ума грузное подземное чудище неповоротливое боящееся света шевелит драконовой чешуей Мысль  это мысль о мысли Безмятежная ясность Душа  это неким образом все сущее душа  форма форм Безмятежность нежданная необъятная лучащаяся форма формТолбот твердилИ дивной властию тогокто шел по водамИ дивной властию Можешь перевернуть  сказал Стивен безразлично  Я ничего не вижу Чего сэр  спросил простодушно Толбот подаваясь впередЕго рука перевернула страницу Он снова выпрямился и продолжал как будто припомнив О том кто шел по водам И здесь лежит его тень на этих малодушных сердцах и на сердце безбожника на его устах на моих Она и на снедаемых любопытством лицах тех что предложили ему динарий Кесарево кесарю а Божие Богу Долгий взгляд темных глаз загадочные слова что без конца будут ткаться на кроснах церкви ДаОтгадай загадку будешь молодецЗернышки посеять мне велел отецТолбот закрыл книжку и сунул ее в ранец Все уже  спросил Стивен Да сэр В десять хоккей сэр Короткий день сэр Четверг А кто отгадает загадку  спросил СтивенОни распихивали учебники падали карандаши шуршали страницыСгрудившись вместе защелкивали и затягивали ранцы разом весело тараторя Загадку сэр Давайте я сэр Я дайте я сэр Какую потрудней сэр Загадка такая  сказал СтивенКочет поетЧист небосводКолокол в небеОдиннадцать бьетБедной душе на небесаЧас улетать настает Отгадайте что это Чего чего сэр Еще разок сэр Мы не расслышалиГлаза их расширились когда он повторил строчки Настала пауза а потом Кокрейн попросил Скажите отгадку сэр Мы сдаемсяСтивен чувствуя подкативший к горлу комок ответил Это лис хоронит свою бабку под остролистомНервически рассмеявшись он встал и эхом ему нестройно раздались их возгласы разочарованияВ дверь стукнули клюшкой и голос из коридора прокричал ХоккейОни кинулись как оголтелые боком выскакивая из за парт перемахивая через сиденья Вмиг комната опустела и из раздевалки послышался их гомон и грохот клюшек и башмаковСарджент единственный кто остался медленно подошел протягивая раскрытую тетрадь Его спутанные волосы и тощая шея выдавали явную неготовность слабые глаза в запотевших очках глядели просяще На блеклой бескровной щеке расплылось чернильное пятно в форме финика еще свежее и влажное как след слизняОн подал тетрадку Наверху страницы было выведено Примеры Дальше шли цифры вкривь и вкось а внизу имелся корявый росчерк с загогулинами и с кляксой Сирил Сарджент личная подпись и печать Мистер Дизи велел все снова переписать и показать вам сэрСтивен потрогал края тетрадки Что толку Ты уже понял как их решать  спросил он С одиннадцатого до пятнадцатого  отвечал Сарджент  Мистер Дизи сказал надо было списать с доски сэр А сам теперь сможешь сделать Нет сэрУродлив и бестолков худая шея спутанные волосы пятно на щеке  след слизня Но ведь какаято любила его выносила под сердцем нянчила на руках Если бы не она мир в своей гонке давно подмял бы его растоптал словно бескостого слизня А она любила его жидкую слабосильную кровь взятую у нее самой Значит это и есть настоящее Единственно истинное в жизни В святом своем рвении пламенный Колумбан перешагнул через тело матери простершейся перед ним Ее не стало дрожащий остов ветки попаленной огнем запах розового дерева и могильного тлена Она спасла его не дала растоптать и ушла почти не коснувшись бытия Бедная душа улетела на небеса  и на вересковой пустоши под мерцающими звездами лис горящие беспощадные глаза рыжим и хищным духом разит от шкуры рыл землю вслушивался откидывал землю вслушивался и рыл рылСидя с ним рядом Стивен решал задачу Он с помощью алгебры доказывает что призрак Шекспира  это дедушка Гамлета Сарджент глядел искоса через съехавшие очки Из раздевалки стук клюшек с поля голоса и глухие удары по мячуЗначки на странице изображали чопорный мавританский танец маскарад букв в причудливых шляпах квадратов и кубов Подача руки поворот поклон партнеру вот так бесовские измышленья мавров И они уже покинули мир Аверроэс и Моисей Маймонид мужи темные обличьем и обхожденьем ловящие в свои глумливые зеркала смутную душу мира и тьма в свете светит и свет не объемлет ее Ну как понял Сможешь сам сделать следующий Да сэрВялыми неуверенными движениями пера Сарджент списал условие То и дело медля в надежде помощи рука его старательно выводила кривые значки слабая краска стыда проступала сквозь блеклую кожу щек   родительный субъекта и объекта Она вскормила его своей жидкой кровью и свернувшимся молоком скрывала от чужих взоров его пеленкиЯ был как он те же косые плечи та же нескладность Детство мое сгорбясь подле меня Ушло и не коснуться его пускай хоть раз хоть слегка Мое ушло а его потаенно как наши взгляды Тайны безмолвно застывшие в темных чертогах двух наших сердец тайны уставшие тиранствовать тираны мечтающие быть свергнутымиПример был решен Вот видишь как просто  сказал Стивен вставая Ага сэр спасибо  ответил СарджентОн промокнул страницу и отнес тетрадь к парте Бери свою клюшку и ступай к ребятам  сказал Стивен направляясь к дверям следом за нескладной фигуркой Ага сэрВ коридоре послышалось его имя его окликали с поля Сарджент Беги мистер Дизи тебя зовет  поторопил СтивенСтоя на крыльце он глядел как пентюх поспешает на поле битвы где голоса затеяли крикливую перебранку Их разделили на команды и мистер Дизи возвращался шагая через метелки травы затянутыми в гетры ногамиЕдва он дошел до школы как снова заспорившие голоса позвали его назад Он обернул к ним сердитые седые усы Ну что еще  прокричал он несколько раз не слушая Кокрейн и Холлидей в одной команде сэр  крикнул ему Стивен Вы не обождете минутку у меня в кабинете  попросил мистер Дизи  пока я тут наведу порядокОн озабоченно зашагал по полю обратно строго покрикивая своим старческим голосом В чем дело Что там ещеПронзительные их крики взметнулись разом со всех сторон от него фигурки их обступили его кольцом а слепящее солнце выбеливало мед его плохо выкрашенной головыПрокуренный застоялый дух царил в кабинете вместе с запахом кожи вытертых тускложелтых кресел Как в первый день когда мы с ним рядились тут Как было вначале так и ныне Сбоку стоял подносик с монетами Стюарта жалкое сокровище ирландских болот и присно И в футляре для ложек на выцветшем алом плюше двенадцать апостолов проповедовавших всем языкам и во веки вековТоропливые шаги по каменному крыльцу в коридоре Раздувая редкие свои усы мистер Дизи остановился у стола Сначала наши небольшие расчетыОн вынул из сюртука перетянутый кожаной ленточкой бумажник Раскрыв его извлек две банкноты одну  из склеенных половинок и бережно положил на стол Два  сказал он вновь перетягивая и убирая бумажникТеперь в хранилище золотых запасов Ладонь Стивена в неловкости блуждала по раковинам лежавшим грудой в холодной каменной ступке волнистые рожки и каури и багрянки а эта вот закручена как тюрбан эмира а эта  гребешок святого Иакова Добро старого пилигрима мертвые сокровища пустые ракушкиСоверен новенький и блестящий упал на мягкий ворс скатерти Три  сказал мистер Дизи вертя в руках свою маленькую копилку  Очень удобная штучка  Смотрите Вот сюда соверены Тут шиллинги полукроны шестипенсовики А сюда  кроны СмотритеОн высыпал на ладонь два шиллинга и две кроны Три двенадцать  сказал он  По моему это правильно Благодарю вас сэр  отвечал Стивен с застенчивою поспешностью собирая деньги и пряча их в карман брюк Не за что  сказал мистер Дизи  Вы это заработалиРука Стивена освободившись вернулась снова к пустым ракушкам Тоже символы красоты и власти Толика денег в моем кармане символы запятнанные алчностью и нищетой Не надо их так носить  предостерег мистер Дизи  Гденибудь вытащите и потеряете Купите лучше такую же штуковину Увидите как это удобноОтвечай чтонибудь У меня она часто будет пустоватьТе же место и час та же премудрость и я тот же Вот уже трижды Три петли вокруг меня Ладно Я их могу разорвать в любой миг если захочу Потому что вы не откладываете  мистер Дизи поднял вверх палец  Вы еще не знаете что такое деньги Деньги  это власть Вот поживете с мое Уж я то знаю Если бы молодость знала Как это там у Шекспира Набей потуже кошелек Яго  пробормотал СтивенОн поднял взгляд от праздных ракушек к глазам старого джентльмена Он знал что такое деньги  продолжал мистер Дизи  он их наживал Поэт но в то же время и англичанин А знаете чем англичане гордятся Какие самые гордые слова у англичанинаПравитель морей Холодные как море глаза смотрели на пустынную бухту повинна история  на меня и мои слова без ненависти Что над его империей никогда не заходит солнце Ха  воскликнул мистер Дизи  Это совсем не англичанин Это сказал французский кельтОн постукал своей копилкой о ноготь большого пальца Я вам скажу  объявил он торжественно  чем он больше всего хвастает и гордится Я никому не долженНадо же какой молодец Я никому не должен Я за всю жизнь не занял ни у кого ни шиллинга Вам понятно такое чувство У меня нет долгов ПонятноМаллигану девять фунтов три пары носков пару обуви галстуки Каррэну десять гиней Макканну гинею Фреду Райену два шиллинга Темплу за два обеда Расселу гинею Казинсу десять шиллингов Бобу Рейнольдсу полгинеи Келеру три гинеи миссис Маккернан за комнату пять недель Малая моя толика бессильна В данный момент нет  ответил СтивенМистер Дизи от души рассмеялся пряча свою копилку Я так и думал  сказал он весело  Но когданибудь вам придется к нему прийти Мы народ щедрый но справедливость тоже нужна Я боюсь этих громких слов  сказал Стивен  они нам приносят столько несчастийМистер Дизи вперил суровый взгляд туда где над камином пребывали дородные стати мужчины в клетчатом килте Альберт Эдуард принц Уэльский Вы меня считаете старым замшелым тори  молвил его задумчивый голос  Со времен ОКоннелла я видел три поколения Я помню голод А вы знаете что ложи оранжистов вели агитацию против унии за двадцать лет до того как этим стал заниматься ОКоннелл причем попы вашей церкви его клеймили как демагога У вас фениев короткая памятьВечная славная и благоговейная память Алмазная ложа в Арме великолепном заваленная трупами папистов При оружии в масках плантаторы хриплыми голосами дают присягу Черный север и истинная голубая библия Берегись стриженыеСтивен сделал легкое движение В моих жилах тоже кровь бунтарей  продолжал мистер Дизи  По женской линии Но прямой мой предок  сэр Джон Блэквуд который голосовал за унию Все мы ирландцы и все потомки королей Увы  сказал Стивен     твердо произнес мистер Дизи Это его девиз Он голосовал за унию и ради этого натянул ботфорты и поскакал в Дублин из Нижнего АрдсаТрала  лала трала лалаНа Дублин путь кремнистДеревенщинасквайр в седле лоснящиеся ботфорты Славный денек сэр Джон Славный денек ваша честь Деньденек Деньденек Ботфорты болтаются трусят в Дублин Трала лала трала лала трусят Кстати это напомнило мне  сказал мистер Дизи  Вы бы могли оказать мне услугу через ваши литературные знакомства У меня тут письмо в газету Вы не присядете на минутку я бы допечатал конецОн подошел к письменному столу у окна подвинул дважды свой стул и перечел несколько слов с листа заправленного в пишущую машинку Присаживайтесь Прошу меня извинить  сказал он через плечо  Законы здравого смысла  Одну минуткуВглядываясь изпод косматых бровей в черновик возле своего локтя и бормоча про себя он принялся тукать по тугим клавишам машинки медленно иногда отдуваясь когда приходилось возвращать валик чтобы стереть опечаткуСтивен бесшумно уселся в присутствии августейшей особы Развешанные по стенам в рамках почтительно застыли изображенья канувших в Лету лошадей уставив кверху кроткие морды Отпор лорда Гастингса Выстрел герцога Вестминстерского Цейлон герцога Бофора взявший Парижский приз в году На седлах легкие жокеи в чутком ожиданье сигнала Он следил за их состязанием поставив на королевские цвета и сливал свои крики с криками канувших в Лету толп Точка  дал указание клавишам мистер Дизи  Однако скорейшее разрешение этого важного вопроса Куда Крэнли меня привел чтобы разом разбогатеть таскались за его фаворитами средь грязью заляпанных бреков орущих букмекеров у стоек трактирной

мясника жадно всосавшейся в апельсинПронзительные крики донеслись с поля и трель свисткаЕще гол Я среди них в свалке их борющихся тел на турнире жизни Ты хочешь сказать тот маменькин сынок заморыш со слегка осовелым видом Турниры Время отражает толчок толчком каждый раз Турниры грязь и рев битв застывшая предсмертная блевотина убитых вопль копий наживленных кровавыми человечьими кишками Готово  произнес мистер Дизи вставая с местаОн подошел к столу скрепляя вместе свои листки Стивен тоже поднялся Я тут все выразил в двух словах  сказал мистер Дизи  Это насчет эпидемии ящура Взгляните бегло пожалуйста Вопрос бесспорныйПозволю себе вторгнуться на ваши уважаемые столбцы Пресловутая политика невмешательства которая столь часто в нашей истории Наша скототорговляСудьба всех наших старинных промыслов Ливерпульская клика похоронившая проект Голуэйского порта Европейские конфликты Перевозки зерна через узкие проливы Завидная невозмутимость ведомства земледелия Не грех вспомнить классиков Кассандра От женщины не блиставшей добродетельюПерейдем к сути дела Я выражаюсь напрямик вы согласны  спросил мистер Дизи у читавшего СтивенаЭпидемия ящура Известен как препарат Коха Сыворотка и вирус Процент вакцинированных лошадей Эпизоотии Императорские конюшни в Мюрцштеге Нижняя Австрия Квалифицированные ветеринары Мистер Генри Блэквуд Прайс Любезное предложение беспристрастной проверки Законы здравого смысла Вопрос чрезвычайно важен Взять быка за рога в прямом и переносном смысле Позвольте поблагодарить за предоставленную возможность Я хочу чтобы это напечатали и прочли  сказал мистер Дизи  Вот увидите при следующей же вспышке они наложат эмбарго на ирландский скот А болезнь излечима И ее лечат Как пишет мне родственник Блэквуд Прайс в Австрии специалисты научились бороться с ней и надежно вылечивают Они предлагают приехать к нам Я пробую найти ходы в ведомстве Сейчас попытаюсь привлечь газеты Но всюду столько препятствий столько интриг закулисных происков чтоПодняв указательный палец он прежде чем продолжать погрозил им стариковато в воздухе Помяните мои слова мистер Дедал  сказал он  Англия в когтях у евреев Финансы пресса на всех самых высоких постах А это признак упадка нации Всюду где они скапливаются они высасывают из нации соки Я это наблюдаю не первый год Ясно как божий день еврейские торгаши уже ведут свою разрушительную работу Старая Англия умираетОн быстро отошел в сторону и глаза его засветились голубизной оказавшись в столбе солнечного света Он оглянулся по сторонам Умирает  повторил он  если уже не умерлаИ крики шлюх глухой поройБритания ткут саван твойГлаза его расширенные представшим видением смотрели сурово сквозь солнечный столб в котором он еще оставался Но торгаш  сказал Стивен  это тот кто дешево покупает и дорого продает будь он еврей или не еврей разве нет Они согрешили против света  внушительно произнес мистер Дизи  У них в глазах тьма Вот потому им и суждено быть вечными скитальцами по сей деньНа ступенях парижской биржи златокожие люди показывают курс на пальцах с драгоценными перстнями Гусиный гогот Развязно и шумно толпятся в храме под неуклюжими цилиндрами зреют замыслы и аферы Все не их и одежда и речь и жесты Их выпуклые медлительные глаза противоречили их словам а жесты были пылки но незлобивы хотя они знали об окружающей вражде и знали что их старания тщетны Тщетно богатеть запасать Время размечет все Богатство запасенное у дороги его разграбят и пустят порукам Глаза их знали годы скитаний и знали смиренные о бесчестье их крови А кто нет  спросил Стивен Что вы хотите сказать  не понял мистер ДизиОн сделал шаг вперед и остановился у стола челюсть косо отвисла в недоумении И это мудрая старость Он ждет пока я ему скажу История  произнес Стивен  это кошмар от которого я пытаюсь проснутьсяНа поле снова крики мальчишек Трель свистка гол А вдруг этот кошмар даст тебе пинка в зад Пути Господни неисповедимы  сказал мистер Дизи  Вся история движется к единой великой цели явлению БогаСтивен ткнув пальцем в окошко проговорил Вот БогУрра Эх фью фьюйть Как это  переспросил мистер Дизи Крик на улице  отвечал Стивен пожав плечамиМистер Дизи опустил взгляд и некоторое время подержал пальцами переносицу Потом поднял взгляд и переносицу отпустил Я счастливей вас  сказал он  Мы совершили много ошибок много грехов Женщина принесла грех в мир Изза женщины не блиставшей добродетелью Елены сбежавшей от Менелая греки десять лет осаждали Трою Неверная жена впервые привела чужеземцев на наши берега жена Макморро и ее любовник ОРурк принц Брефни И Парнелла погубила женщина Много ошибок Много неудач но только не главный грех Сейчас на склоне дней своих я еще борец И я буду бороться за правое дело до концаПраво свое волю свою Ольстер добудет в боюСтивен поднял руку с листками Так значит сэр  начал он Сдается мне  сказал мистер Дизи  что вы не слишком задержитесь на этой работе Вы не родились учителем Хотя возможно я ошибаюсь Скорее я ученик  сказал СтивенА чему тебе тут учиться Мистер Дизи покачал головой Как знать Ученик должен быть смиренным Но жизнь  великий учительСтивен опять зашуршал листками Так насчет этого  начал он Да да  сказал мистер Дизи  Я дал вам два экземпляра Желательно чтобы напечатали сразуТелеграф Айриш Хомстед Я попробую  сказал Стивен  и завтра вам сообщу Я немного знаком с двумя редакторами Вот и хорошо  живо откликнулся мистер Дизи  Вчера вечером я написал письмо мистеру Филду ЧП Сегодня в гостинице Городской герб собрание Ассоциации скотопромышленников Я его попросил огласить мое письмо в этом собрании А вы попробуйте через ваши газетыЭто какие Ивнинг телеграф Вот и хорошо  повторил мистер Дизи  Не будем же терять времени Мне еще надо написать ответ тому родственнику Всего доброго  сказал Стивен пряча листки в карман  Благодарю вас Не за что  отозвался мистер Дизи принимаясь рыться в бумагах у себя на столе  Я хоть и стар сам люблю скрестить с вами копья Всего доброго сэр  повторил Стивен кланяясь его склоненной спинеОн вышел на крыльцо через открытые двери и зашагал под деревьями по гравийной дорожке слыша звонкие голоса и треск клюшек Львы покойно дремали на постаментах когда он проходил мимо через ворота беззубые чудища Что ж помогу ему в его баталии Маллиган даст мне новое прозвище быколюбивый бард Мистер ДедалНагоняет меня Надеюсь не с новым письмом Одну минутку Да сэр  отозвался Стивен поворачивая обратно к воротамМистер Дизи остановился запыхавшись дыша прерывисто и тяжело Я только хотел добавить  проговорил он  Утверждают что Ирландия к своей чести это единственная страна где никогда не преследовали евреев Вы это знаете Нет А вы знаете почему Лицо его сурово нахмурилось от яркого света Почему же сэр  спросил Стивен пряча улыбку Потому что их сюда никогда не пускали  торжественно объявил мистер ДизиКом смеха и кашля вылетел у него из горла потянув за собой трескучую цепь мокроты Он быстро повернул назад кашляя и смеясь размахивая руками над головой Их никогда сюда не пускали  еще раз прокричал он сквозь смех топая по гравию дорожки затянутыми в гетры ногами  Вот почемуСквозь ажур листьев солнце рассыпало на его велемудрые плечи пляшущие золотые звездочки и монеткиЭпизод Неотменимая модальность зримого Хотя бы это если не больше говорят моей мысли мои глаза Я здесь чтобы прочесть отметы сути вещей всех этих водорослей мальков подступающего прилива того вон ржавого

ещеОсторожно Он лысый был и миллионер      Предел прозрачного в Почему в Прозрачное непрозрачное Куда пролезет вся пятерня это ворота куда нет  дверь Закрой глаза и смотриСтивен закрыв глаза прислушался как хрустят хрупкие ракушки и водоросли у него под ногами Так или иначе ты сквозь это идешь Иду шажок за шажком За малый шажок времени сквозь малый шажок пространстваПять шесть это  Совершенно верно и это  неотменимая модальность слышимого Открой глаза Нет Господи Если я свалюсь с утеса грозного нависшего над морем свалюсь неотменимо сквозь  Отлично передвигаюсь в темнотеНа боку

укрытием сквозь павлиньих подрагиванье ресниц он глядел на южнеющее солнце Тут как в раскаленной печи Час Пана полуденный отдых фавнаСредь соконалитых змеерастений млекоточивых плодов где широко раскинулись листья на бронзовоцветных водах Боль далекоНе прячь глаза и не скорбиВзор его поскорбел над тупоносыми башмаками быка обносками  Он сосчитал вмятины на покоробленной коже в которой удобно

забрал Лучше другой купитьОн аккуратно положил сухую козявку которую уколупнул в носу на выступ скалы Желающие пусть смотрятПозади Кажется ктото естьОн обернулся через плечо взирая назад Пронося в воздухе высокие перекладины трех мачт с парусами убранными по трем крестам салингов домой против течения безмолвно скользя безмолвный корабльЭпизод Мистер Леопольд Блум с удовольствием ел внутренние органы животных и птиц Он любил жирный суп из гусиных потрохов пупки с орехами жареное фаршированное сердце печенку поджаренную ломтиками в сухарях жареные наважьи молоки Всего же больше любил он бараньи почки на углях которые оставляли во рту тонкий привкус с отдаленным ароматом мочиПочки не выходили из головы у него пока он стараясь тихо ступать собирал для нее завтрак на горбатом подносе На кухне было прохладно даже зябко хотя за окном стояло летнее погожее утро Это както еще разжигало аппетитУголь в очаге разгоралсяХлеб с маслом еще ломтик  три четыре  и хватит Она не любит когда гора на тарелке Хватит Отойдя от подноса он снял с полки чайник и поставил на огонь сбоку Чайник сел тусклой глыбой выставив торчком хобот Скоро поспеет Хорошо Во рту сухоКошка ходила на прямых лапах вокруг ножки стола хвост кверху Мррау А вот ты где  сказал мистер Блум оборачиваясь от очагаКошка мяукнула в ответ и продолжала путь вокруг ножки ступая на прямых лапах мяукая Вот так же она разгуливает по моему письменному столуМурр Почеши за ушком МуррМистер Блум с добродушным интересом поглядел на черное гибкое существоЛадный вид шерстка гладкая и блестит белая пуговка под хвостом глаза зеленые светятся Он нагнулся к ней упершись ладонями в колени Молочка киске Мррау  громко мяукнула онаГоворят они глупые Они понимают что мы говорим лучше чем мы их понимаем Вот эта все что хочет поймет И злопамятная Интересно каким я ей кажусь Вышиной с башню Нет она ведь может на меня вспрыгнуть А цыплят боится  поддразнил он ее  Боится цыпцыпочек В жизни не видал такой глупой кискиЖестокая Это у них в природе Странно что мыши при этом не пищат Как будто им нравится Мгррау  мяукнула она громчеГлаза ее жадные полуприкрытые от стыда моргнули и жалобно протяжно мяукнув она выставила свои молочнобелые зубки Он видел как сужаются от жадности черные щелки ее зрачков превращая глаза в зеленые камешки Подойдя к шкафу он взял кувшин свеженаполненный разносчиком от Ханлона налил на блюдце теплопузырчатого молока и осторожно поставил блюдце на пол Мяв  взвизгнула она кидаясь к едеОн смотрел как металлически поблескивают ее усы в тусклом свете и как трижды примерившись она легко принялась лакать Правда или нет что если усы подрезать не сможет охотиться Почему бы Может кончики светят в темноте Или служат как щупики возможноОн слушал как она лакает Яичницу с ветчиной не стоит В такую сушь яйца нехорошо Хочется свежей чистой воды Баранью почку у Бакли сегодня тоже не стоит четверг Обжарить в масле  и с перчиком Лучше свиную почку у Длугача Пока чайник не закипел Она лакала все медленней потом вылизала блюдце Почему у них языки такие шершавые Лакать удобней сплошь пористые в дырочках Ничего она тут не слопает Он поглядел кругомНичегоТихо поскрипывая подошвами он поднялся по лестнице в переднюю и стал у дверей спальни Может она захочет чегонибудь повкусней Обычно предпочитает небольшие бутербродики утром Но всетаки  вдругОн проговорил негромко стоя в пустой передней Я схожу за угол Через минуту вернусьУслышал звуки своего голоса добавил Тебе чегонибудь не захватить к завтракуМягкий и сонный голос пробормотал в ответ НнеНет Ничего не хочет Затем послышался глубокий парной вздох еще мягче это она повернулась в постели и разболтанные медные кольца звякнули Надо чтоб подтянули Жаль Из Гибралтара неблизкий путьСовсем забыла испанский и ту малость что знала Интересно сколько папаша за нее заплатил Фасон старинный Ах да конечно С губернаторского аукциона По знакомству По части денег старина Твиди кремень Да сэрБыло дело под Плевной Я вышел из рядовых сэр и горжусь этим Но всетаки хватило ума провернуть дельце с марками Проявил дальновидностьРука его сняла шляпу с крючка над толстым пальто с его монограммой и над ношеным плащом с распродажи забытых вещей Марка картинка а сзади клей Наверняка из офицеров многие этим промышляют Что говоритьПропотевшее клеймо на дне шляпы молча сообщило ему Плестоу шляпылю Он заглянул воровато за кожаный ободок Белая полоска бумаги Надежное местоНа крыльце он ощупал брючный карман тут ли ключ Нету В тех что оставил Надо бы взять Картофелина на месте Гардероб скрипит Не стоит ее тревожить Была совсем сонная Он притянул дверь к себе осторожно еще чутьчуть пока защитная полоска внизу не прикрыла порожек усталым векомНа вид закрыто Обойдется до моего приходаОн перешел на солнечную сторону минуя открытый люк погреба в семьдесят пятом доме Солнце приближалось к шпилю церкви святого Георгия Похоже день будет жаркий Когда в этом черном особенно чувствуешь Черное проводит отражает а может преломляет тепло Но в светлом костюме никак нельзя Не пикник От ощущения блаженного тепла глаза его часто жмурились фургон из пекарни Боланда лотки наш насущный но ей вчерашний больше по вкусу пироги горячая хрустящая корочка Чувствуешь себя помолодевшим Гденибудь на востоке вот таким утром пуститься в путь на заре Будешь двигаться впереди солнца  выиграешь у него день А если все время так то в принципе никогда не постареешь ни на один день Идешь вдоль берега в незнакомой стране подходишь к городским воротам там стража тоже какойнибудь служака с усищами старины Твиди опирается на этакую длинную пику Бродишь по улицам под навесами Головы прохожих в тюрбанах Темные пещеры лавок где торгуют коврами внутри здоровенный турок Свирепый турка сидит поджавши ноги покуривая витой кальян Крики

новые подвязки у Молли Звуки струн Слушаешь Девушка играет на этом инструменте как же он называется цимбалы Идешь дальшеА может быть там все и не так Начитался этой ерунды по следам солнца С сияющим солнцем на титуле Он усмехнулся самодовольно Как сказал Артур Гриффит про ту заставку над передовицей во Фримене солнце гомруля восходит на северозападе из переулка за Ирландским банком Он длил усмешку В духе еврейского остроумия солнце гомруля восходит на северозападеОн приблизился к пивной Ларри ОРурка Изпод решетки погреба плыли влажные испарения портера Через раскрытые двери бара несло имбирем бросовым чаем и бисквитной трухой Но заведение стоящее как раз у трамвайного кольца Скажем Маколи там подальше гиблое место А если бы провели линию вдоль Северной окружной от скотного рынка к набережным цена тут же бы подскочилаЛысая голова над занавеской Прижимист старый пройдоха Насчет рекламы с ним бесполезно Что ж в своем деле ему видней Вон он наш бравый Ларри без пиджака прислонясь к мешкам с сахаром созерцает как прислужник в фартуке орудует с ведром и шваброй Саймон Дедал его отлично копирует как он щурит свои глазенки Знаете я вам что скажу Что же мистер ОРурк Знаете для японцев русские  только закуска к завтракуСтоп надо перекинуться парой слов может про похороны Бедняга Дигнам вы уже слышали мистер ОРуркСворачивая на Дорсетстрит он бодро окликнул в дверь День добрый

Длугача глядя на связки колбас копченых и кровяных темных и светлых Пятнадцать помножить на Цифры ускользая вертелись в его мозгу он недовольно прогнал их Глянцевитые кольца туго начиненные мясом насыщали его взгляд и он безмятежно вдыхал пряный и парной запах вареной свиной кровиПочка сочила кровь на блюдо с рисунком из ивовых ветвей последняя Он стоял у прилавка следом за соседской прислугой Возьмет ее или нет Она вычитывала по пунктам держа в руке списочек Руки потрескались от стирки И полтора фунта сосисок Денни Взгляд его приковали мощные бедраВудс его фамилия Чем занимается неизвестно Жена уже старовата Свежая кровь Ухажеров не разрешают Руки крепкие Выбивала ковер на веревкеСерьезно выбивала я вам скажу Юбка сбилась на сторону взлетала с каждым ударомХореглазый свинопродавец свертывал низку сосисок толстыми розовыми как сосиски пальцами Эк тугомяса что телка откормленная в стойлеОн взял один листок из лежавшей стопки Образцовая ферма в Киннерете на берегу Тивериадского озера Можно создать идеальный зимний санаторийМозес Монтефиоре я так и думал Усадьба обнесена стеной в смутной дымке пасущиеся стада Он отставил от себя листок интересно прочесть повнимательней пасущиеся стада в дымке листок похрустывал Молоденькая белая телочка Бывало поутру на скотном рынке ревут быки клейменые овцы в загонах шлепается навоз скотоводы чавкают по грязи в кованых сапогах держа неошкуренные прутья похлопывают скотину по мясистым задам гляди  первый сорт Он заставлял себя невозмутимо держать листок обуздывая волю и чувства устремив в точку кроткий застывший взор Юбка сбилась взлетала каждый раз  рраз  рразСвинопродавец выхватил два листа из стопки завернул первосортные сосиски осклабил медную рожу Пожалте миссС дерзкой ухмылкой она протянула ему монету в своей мощной руке Благодарим мисс Сдача шиллинг три пенса А вам сэрМистер Блум не мешкая показал Догнать и пойти за ней если недалеко еще следом за колыхающимися окороками Недурно как первая утренняя картинка Да поживей ты тьфу Куй железо пока горячо Она вышла из лавки постояла на ярком солнце и двинулась ленивой походкой направо Он вздохнул выпустив воздух через нос они никогда не понимают Руки огрубели от стирки И на ногах ногти с наростами Изодранная темная власяница защищает все подступы Укол от ее равнодушия разгорелся в груди у него до слабого наслаждения Не тебе другому какойто констебль на досуге тискал ее на Экклслейн Они любят когда есть за что подержатьсяПервосортные сосиски Ахах я заблудилась о мистер полисмен Три пенса сэрРука его приняла влажную мякоть и опустила в боковой карман Затем выудила из брючного кармана три монетки и положила на резиновые пупырышкиОни полежали миг были мигом подсчитаны и мигом отправлены одна за другой в ящик кассы Спасибо сэр ЗаходитеЛисьи глазки благодаря его метнули испытующую искорку Мистер Блум почти сразу же отвел взгляд Нет  лучше не стоит  в другой раз Всего доброго  произнес он уходя Всего доброго сэрНи следа

Мэрион ПольдиВойдя в спальню он полуприкрыл глаза и двигаясь сквозь теплый и желтый сумрак приблизился к ее растрепанной голове Кому там письмаОн поглядел на них Моллингар Милли Письмо мне от Милли  сказал он следя за своим голосом  а тебе открытка И письмо тебеОн положил ее письмо и открытку на саржевое покрывало у сгиба ее колен Тебе шторы поднятьПодтягивая осторожно шторы до половины он видел через плечо как она глянула на конверт и сунула его под подушку Хватит так  спросил он оборачиваясьОна читала открытку приподнявшись на локте Посылка дошла уже  сказала онаОн не уходил она отложила открытку и медленно с блаженным вздохом опять свернулась клубком Давайка чай поскорей  поторопила она  Совсем горло пересохло Чайник уже кипитОднако он задержался убрать со стула полосатая нижняя юбка нечистое мятое белье и взяв все в охапку положил в ноги постелиКогда он был уже на ступеньках она окликнула Польди Что Ошпарь заварной чайникВполне закипел пар валит из носика Он ошпарил и сполоснул заварной чайник насыпал четыре полных ложечки чаю и наклонив большой чайник залил чай водой Поставив чай настояться он отодвинул большой чайник в сторону и вдавив сковороду прямо в жар угля смотрел как масло плавится и скользит по ней Когда он развернул почку кошка жадно мяукнула рядом с ним Если ей давать много мяса не будет мышей ловить Говорят они не едят свинину Кошер Он бросил ей окровавленную обертку и положил почку в шипящее масло Перцу Он взял щепотку из выщербленной рюмки для яйца посыпал круговыми движениямиПотом он распечатал письмо скользнул глазами по всей странице

он поднял поднос Все взял Бутерброды  четыре сахар ложечка сливки Так Он направился с подносом наверх продев большой палец в ручку чайникаТолкнув дверь коленом он вошел и поставил поднос на стул у изголовья постели До чего же ты долго  сказала онаМедь задребезжала когда она проворно приподнялась упершись локтем в подушку Он спокойно смотрел на ее полные формы и на ложбинку между мягких больших грудей круглившихся в ночной рубашке как козье вымя Тепло шедшее от ее тела мешалось в воздухе с душистым запахом наливаемого чаяКраешек распечатанного конверта торчал изпод примятой подушки Уже уходя

подвязку с чулком подошва мятая залоснилась Да нет же книжкуДругой чулок Нижняя юбка Должно быть упала  сказала онаОн поглядел по сторонам     Интересно правильно ли она произносит  На кровати нигдеЗавалилась кудато Он нагнулся и приподнял подзор Упавшая книга распласталась на пузе ночного горшка в оранжевую полоску Дайка мне  сказала она  Я тут отметила Хотела одно слово спроситьСделав глоток из чашки которую держала за неручку и обтерев бесцеремонно пальцы об одеяло она принялась водить по странице шпилькой покуда не нашла слово Метим что  переспросил он Вот это  сказала она  Что это значитНаклонившись он прочел подле холеного ногтя на ее большом пальце Метемпсихоз Вотвот С чем это вообще едят Метемпсихоз  начал он морща лоб  это греческое Из греческого языка Это означает переселение душ Ну и дичь  оценила она  А теперь скажи попростомуОн улыбнулся искоса глянув в ее смеющиеся глаза Все те же молодые глаза Первый вечер после игры в шарады Долфинсбарн Он полистал замусоленные страницы Руби  краса арены Ага картинка Свирепый итальянец с хлыстом А это видно Руби краса чего там положено голая на полу Милостиво дали прикрыться Злодей Маффей остановился и с проклятиями отшвырнул прочь свою жертву Всюду жестокость Одурманенные звери Трапеция в цирке Хенглера Не мог смотреть отвернулся А толпа глазеет Ты там надрывай силы а мы животики себе надорвем Их целые семьиВдалбливают им смолоду они и метемпсихозят Будто бы мы живем после смерти Души наши Будто душа человека когда он умрет Дигнама вот душа Ты ее уже кончила  спросил он Да  сказала она  Совсем никакой клубнички Она что все время любила того первого Я даже не заглядывал Хочешь другую Ага Принеси еще Поль де Кока Такое симпатичное имяОна подлила себе чаю глядя сбоку на струйкуНадо продлить ту книжку из библиотеки на Кейплстрит а то напишут Карни моему поручителю Перевоплощение вот то самое слово Некоторые верят  начал он  что после смерти мы будем снова жить в другом теле и что уже жили раньше Это называется перевоплощение Что все мы уже жили раньше тысячи лет назад на земле или на какойнибудь другой планете Они считают мы забыли про это А некоторые говорят будто помнят свои прошлые жизниГустые сливки вились витками у нее в чашке Как бы ей лучше запомнить это слово метемпсихоз Хорошо бы пример ПримерНад кроватью Купанье нимфы Приложение к пасхальному номеру Фотокартинок роскошный шедевр великолепные краски Как чай до того как налили молока Похожа на нее с распущенными волосами только потоньше За рамку отдано три и шесть Она сказала над кроватью будет красивоОбнаженные нимфы  Греция  а вот и пример  все люди что тогда жилиОн перелистал страницы обратно Метемпсихоз  сказал он  так это называли древние греки Они верили что человек может превратиться в животное или скажем в деревоЧто они называли нимфами напримерОна перестала вдруг помешивать ложечкой Смотрела прямо перед собой и втягивала воздух округлившимися ноздрями Горелым пахнет  сказала она  У тебя там ничего на огне Почка  возопил онОн сунул не глядя книжку во внутренний карман и стукнувшись носком ноги о хромой комод ринулся на запах сбегая по лестнице прыжками всполошенного аиста Пахучий дым поднимался сердитой струйкой с одного края сковороды Поддев почку вилкой он отодрал ее и перевернул как на спину черепаху Совсем чутьчуть подгорела Он перебросил ее на тарелку и полил оставшимся бурым сокомТеперь чайку Он уселся отрезал ломоть хлеба намазал маслом Срезал пригорелую мякоть и бросил кошке Наконец отправил кусочек на вилке в рот и принялся жевать разборчиво смакуя упругое аппетитное мясо В самый разГлоток чаю Потом он нарезал хлеб на кубики обмакнул один в соус и сунул в рот Так что там у нее про студента и про пикник Он разложил около себя листок с письмом и медленно стал читать жуя макая кубики в соус и отправляя их в ротДражайший папулькаПреогромнейшее спасибо за твой чудный подарочек ко дню рождения Он мне дивно идет Все говорят что в новой беретке я просто неотразима

Милли Извини за каракули очень спешу Пока МПятнадцать вчера Как сошлось и число пятнадцатое Первый день рождения в чужих местах Разлука Помню летнее утро когда она родиласьПомчался за миссис Торнтон на Дензиллстрит Бодрая старушка Куче младенцев помогла явиться на свет Она с первой минуты знала бедняжке Руди не жить Авось Бог милостив сэр А сама уже знала Остался бы жить сейчас было бы одиннадцатьОтсутствующим печальным взглядом он смотрел на постскриптум Извини за каракули Спешу Внизу пианино Выпорхнула из гнезда Сцена с ней изза браслета в кафе  Не стала есть пирожные не глядела не разговаривала Дерзкая девчонка Он обмакнул в соус еще кубик хлеба машинально продолжая доедать почку Двенадцать и шесть в неделю Не густоНо могло и похуже быть Мюзикхолл скажем Студент Он глотнул остывшего чаю запить еду Потом опять перечел письмо дваждыНу ладно она умеет вести себя осмотрительно А вдруг нет Оставь ничего еще не случилось Все возможно конечно Во всяком случае обождемБесенок Вечно бегом по лестнице ножки тонкие стройные СудьбаНаступает зрелость Кокетка  страшнаяОн улыбнулся в кухонное окно с теплотой с тревогой Однажды вижу ее на улице щиплет себя за щеки чтоб

улыбаясьСожаление и потерянность нарастая смутной волной расползались вниз по спине Да случится Помешать Бесполезно что сделаешь Девичьи губы нежные легкие Случится то же Он чувствовал как волна потерянности охватывает его Бесполезно тут чтото делать Губы целуют целующие целуемые Женские губы полные клейкиеЛучше пусть там где она сейчас подальше И занята Хотела собаку от нечего делать Можно бы туда съездить На табельные дни в августе всего два и шесть в оба конца Но это через полтора месяца Можно бы устроить бесплатный проезд как журналисту Или через МаккояКошка вылизав свою шерстку вернулась к обертке в кровяных пятнах потыкала ее носом и пошла к двери Оглянулась на него мяукнула Хочет выйти Жди перед дверью  когданибудь отворится Пусть подождет Както занервничала Электричество Гроза в воздухе И умывала ушко спиной к огнюОн ощутил сытую тяжесть  потом легкие позывы в желудке Поднялся изза стола распуская брючный ремень Кошка настойчиво мяукнула Мяу  передразнил он  Обождешь пока я сам соберусьТяжесть день будет жаркий Лень подыматься на площадку по лестницеГазетку В сортире он любил читать Надеюсь никакая макака туда не забредет пока яВ ящике стола ему попался старый номер Осколков Свернув он сунул его под мышку подошел к двери и отворил Кошка кинулась мягкими прыжками наверх А вон ты куда  свернуться на постели клубкомПрислушавшись он услыхал ее голос Поди сюда кисонька Ну подиОн вышел с черного хода во двор постоял прислушиваясь к звукам соседнего двора Все тихо Может быть вешают белье Королевна в парке вешает белье Славное утроОн наклонился взглянуть на чахлые кустики мяты посаженной вдоль стеныПоставить беседку здесь Бобы дикий виноград И надо везде удобрить земля плохая Бурая корка серы Почва всегда такая без навоза Кухонные помои Перегной  что бы это за штука У соседей куры вот их помет  отличное удобрение Но самое лучшее от скота особенно если кормили жмыхами Сухой навоз Лучшее средство для чистки лайковых перчаток Грязь очищает И зола Надо тут все переделать В том углу горох Салат Всегда будет свежая зелень Но с этими садиками свои неудобства Тот шмель или овод в Духов деньОн двинулся по дорожке А где моя шляпа кстати Должно быть повесил обратно на крючок Или оставил наверху Вот номер совсем не помню На вешалке в прихожей слишком полно Четыре зонтика ее плащ Подбирал письма У Дрейго колокольчик звонил Как странно именно в этот момент я думал Его волосы каштановые напомаженные над воротничком Свежевымыт и свежепричесан Не знаю успею ли зайти в баню Тарастрит Тип что у них за кассой устроил побег Джеймсу Стивенсу Такие слухи ОБрайенКаким он басом говорит этот Длугач Агенда  как там Пожалте миссЭнтузиастОн отворил толкнув носком ветхую дверь сортира Смотри чтобы не запачкать брюки потом на похороны Вошел пригнув голову стараясь не задеть о низкий косяк Оставив дверь приоткрытой посреди пыльной паутины и вони заплесневелой хлорки не спеша отстегнул подтяжки Перед тем как усесться бросил через щель взгляд на соседское окно А король на троне пишет манифест Никого нетРаскорячившись на позорном стуле он развернул журнал на оголенных коленях и стал читать Чтонибудь новенькое и полегче Не торопись особоПопридержи Наш премированный осколок Мастерский удар Мэтчена Автор  мистер Филип Бьюфой член лондонского Клуба театралов Гонорар по гинее за столбец Три с половиной Три фунта три Три фунта тринадцать и шестьОн мирно прочел сдерживая себя первый столбец затем уступая но еще придерживая начал второй На середине окончательно уступив он дал кишечнику опорожниться свободно продолжая мирно неторопливо читать вчерашний легкий запор прошел без следа Авось не слишком толсто геморрой снова не разойдется Нет самый раз Ага Уфф Для страдающих запором одна таблетка святой коры В жизни может такое быть Это не тронуло и не взволновало его но в общем было бойко и живо Теперь что хочешь печатают На безрыбье Он читал дальше спокойно сидя над своими подымавшимися миазмами Бойко что говорить Мэтчен часто вспоминает свой мастерский удар покоривший сердце смеющейся чаровницы которая нынеМораль в конце и в начале Рука об руку Лихо Он снова окинул взглядом прочитанное и выпуская ровную заключительную струю благодушно позавидовал мистеру Бьюфою который сочинил это и получил гонорар в размере трех фунтов тринадцати шиллингов и шести пенсовЯ б тоже мог коечто накропать Авторы  мистер и миссис ЛМБлумПридумать историйку на тему пословицы Какой только Както пробовал записывать на манжете что она говорит пока собирается Не люблю собираться вместе Порезался бреясь Покусывает нижнюю губку застегивая крючки на

туфельку об чулки на икрах обе по очереди так ловкоНаутро после благотворительного бала когда оркестр Мэя исполнял танец часов Понкьелли Объяснял ей утренние часы потом день вечер потом ночные часы Она чистила зубы Это была первая встреча У нее голова кружилась Пощелкивали пластинки веера А этот Бойлан богатый Да он со средствами А что Я во время танца заметила у него пахнет чемто приятным изо рта Тогда не стоит мурлыкать Надо бы намекнуть В последний раз какаято странная музыка Зеркало было в темноте Она взяла свое маленькое потерла о кофточку на грудях нервно так и заколыхались Потом смотрелась Нахмуренный взгляд Чегото там такое не сладилосьВечерние часы девушки в серых газовых платьях Потом ночные часы в черном с кинжалами в полумасках Это поэтично розовое потом золотое потом серое потом черное И в то же время как в жизни День потом ночьОн смело оторвал половину премированного рассказа и подтерся ею Потом поднял брюки застегнул надел подтяжки Потянул на себя кривую шаткую дверь сортира и вышел из полумрака на воздухПри ярком свете облегченный и освеженный в членах он тщательно осмотрел свои черные брюки их обшлага колени и за коленями Во сколько похороны Надо уточнить по газетеМрачные скрипучие звуки высоко в воздухе Колокола церкви святого Георгия Они отбивали время гулкий мрачный металлЭй  гей Эй  гейЭй  гей Эй  гейЭй  гей Эй  гейБез четверти Потом снова по воздуху донесся обертон терцияБедный ДигнамЭпизод По набережной сэра Джона Роджерсона шагал собранным шагом мистер Блум мимо ломовых подвод мимо маслобойни Лиска льняное масло жмыхи мимо Уиндмилллейн и мимо почтовотелеграфного отделения На этот адрес тоже было бы можно И мимо богадельни для моряков С шумливой утренней набережной он повернул на Лаймстрит У коттеджей Брэди шатался мальчишкасвалочник примкнув ведерко с требухой сосал жеваный окурокДевчонка помладше с изъеденным коростой лбом глазела на него вяло придерживая ржавый обруч Сказать ему если курит  перестанет расти Да ладно оставь в покое И так житье у него не рай Ждать у трактира тащить папашу домой Тять ну пойдем мамка ждет Как раз затишье не будет много народу Он перешел Таунсендстрит миновал хмурый фасад Бетеля Да ЭльЕго дом Алеф Бет Потом похоронное бюро Николса В одиннадцать Времени хватит Ейей Корни Келлехер подкинул эту работенку ОНилу Напевает прикрыв глаза Корни Повстречал я в темном парке Одну пташку Возле арки Работает на полицию Свое имя мне сказала и мои труляля труляля там там Ясное дело он подкинул Схоронитека по дешевке в сухомнемазаном И мои труляля труляля труляля труляляНа Уэстлендроу он остановился перед витриной Белфастской и Восточной чайной компании прочел ярлыки на пачках в свинцовой фольге отборная смесь высшее качество семейный чай Жарко становится Чай Надо бы им разжиться у Тома Кернана Хотя похороны  неподходящий случай Покуда глаза его невозмутимо читали он снял не торопясь шляпу вдохнув запах своего брильянтина и плавным неторопливым жестом провел правой рукой по лбу и по волосам Какое жаркое утро Глаза изпод приспущенных век отыскали чуть заметную выпуклость на кожаном ободке внутри его шляпылюВот она Правая рука погрузилась в тулью Пальцы живо нащупали за ободком карточку переместили в карман жилетаДо того жарко Правая рука еще раз еще неторопливей поднялась и прошлась отборная смесь из лучших цейлонских сортов На дальнем востокеДолжно быть чудесный уголок сад мира

такое весОн повернулся и неспешно перешел через улицу Как это она вышагивала с сосисками Примерно так вот На ходу он вынул из бокового кармана сложенный Фримен развернул его скатал в трубку по длине и начал похлопывать себя по брюкам при каждом неспешном шаге Беззаботный вид заглянул просто так В секунду за секунду Это значит в секунду на каждую секунду С тротуара он метнул цепкий взгляд в двери почты Ящик для опоздавших писем Опускать сюда Никого ПошелОн протянул свою карточку через медную решетку Нет ли для меня писем  спросил онПока почтовая барышня смотрела в ячейке он разглядывал плакат вербовочной службы солдаты всех родов войск на параде и держа конец своей трубки у самых ноздрей вдыхал запах свежей типографской краскиНет наверно ответа В последний раз зашел слишком далекоБарышня сквозь решетку подала ему карточку и письмо Он поблагодарил бросив быстрый взгляд на конверт заадресованный на машинкеЗдесьПочтовое Отделение Уэстлендроу до востребованияГенри Флауэру эсквайруОтветила

чтото исправишь Рука его опустилась в карман указательный палец просунулся под клапан конверта и вскрыл его несколькими рывками Не думаю чтобы женщины особо обращали внимание Пальцы вытащили письмо и скомкали в кармане конверт Чтото подколото наверно фотография Прядь волос НетМаккой Как бы поскорей отвязаться Одна помеха Чужое присутствие только злит когда ты Здравствуйте Блум Куда направляетесь

стоявший у подъезда отеля Гровнор Швейцар поставил чемодан между сиденьями Она спокойно стояла в ожидании а мужчина муж брат похож на нее искал мелочь в карманахПальто модного фасона с круглым воротником слишком теплое для такой погоды на вид как байка Стоит в небрежной позе руки в карманы накладные сейчас так носят Как та надменная дамочка на игре в поло Все женщины свысока пока не

потому что нельзя подслушать Или отравленный букет разделаться с ним Шагая медленно дальше он перечел еще раз письмо шепча отдельные слова про себя Сердились тюльпаны на тебя миленький мужецвет проучить твой кактус если ты пожалуйста бедняжка незабудка я так мечтаю фиалки мой милый розы когда же мы анемоны встретимся противный ночной пестик жена духи Марте Он перечел до конца вынул его из газеты и спрятал обратно в боковой карманТихая радость приоткрыла его губы Не сравнить с первым письмомИнтересно сама писала Разыгрывает возмущение я девушка из хорошей семьи пример добродетели Могли бы встретиться в воскресенье после мессыБольшое спасибо  не по моей части Обычная любовная драчка Потом разбегутся по углам Не лучше чем сцены с Молли Сигара успокаиваетНаркотик В следующий раз пойти еще дальше Противный мальчишка проучить боится слов конечно Чтонибудь шокирующее а Стоит попробовать Каждый раз понемножкуПродолжая ощупывать письмо в кармане он вытащил из него булавкуПростая булавка Он бросил ее на землю Откуданибудь из одежды чтото закалывала Это немыслимо сколько на них булавок Нет розы без шиповГрубые дублинские голоса взвыли у него в голове В ту ночь в Куме две девки обнявшись под дождемЭх у Мэри панталоны на одной булавкеА булавка упадет Как домой она дойдетКак домой она дойдетКто Мэри Ужасно болит голова Наверно их месячные розы Или целый день за машинкой Вредно для нервов желудка Зрительное напряжение Какими духами душится твоя жена Додумалась аКак домой она дойдетМарта Мэри Мария и Марфа Гдето я видел эту картину забыл уже старого мастера или подделка Он сидит у них в доме разговариваетТаинственно Те девки из Кума тоже слушали быКак домой она дойдетПриятное вечернее чувство Скитанья кончены Можешь расслабиться  мирные сумерки  пусть все идет своим чередом Забудь Рассказывай о тех местах где ты был о чужих обычаях Другая с кувшином на голове готовила ужин фрукты маслины прохладная вода из колодца хладнокаменного как дырка в стене в Эштауне В следующий раз как пойду на бега надо будет прихватить бумажный стаканчик Она слушает с расширенными глазами темные ласковые глаза Рассказывай  еще и еще  все расскажи И потом вздох молчание Долгий  долгий  долгий покойПроходя под железнодорожным мостом он вынул конверт проворно изорвал на клочки и пустил по ветру Клочки разлетелись быстро падая вниз в сыром воздухе белая стайка потом все попадалиГенри Флауэр Вот так можно разорвать и чек на сто фунтов Простой листик бумаги Лорд Айви явился както в Ирландский банк с семизначным чеком получил миллион наличными Вот и смотри что можно взять на портере Зато другой братец лорд Ардилон говорят должен менять рубашку четыре раза на день Какието вши не то черви Миллион фунтов минуткуДва пенса  это пинта четыре  кварта значит галлон портера восемь пенсов хотя нет шиллинг четыре пенса Двадцать поделить на один и четыре примерно пятнадцать Так точно Пятнадцать миллионов бочонков портераЧто я говорю бочонков Галлонов Но все равно около миллиона бочонковПрибывающий поезд тяжело пролязгал над головой у него один вагон за другим В голове стукались бочонки плескался и переливался мутный портерЗатычки вылетели полился мощный мутный поток растекаясь по грязной земле петляя образуя озерки и водовороты хмельной влаги и увлекая с собой широколистые цветы ее пеныОн подошел к отворенным задним дверям церкви Всех Святых Ступив на крыльцо снял шляпу вытащил из кармана визитную карточку и снова засунул ее за кожаный ободок Тьфу ты Ведь мог прощупать Маккоя насчет бесплатного проезда в МоллингарПрежнее объявление на дверях Проповедь высокопреподобного Джона Конми ОИ о святом Петре Клавере ОИ и об африканской миссии Спасать миллионы китайцев Как они ухитряются это растолковать косоглазым Те предпочли бы унцию опиума Жители Небесной Империи Для них первейшая ересь За обращение Гладстона молились когда был уже почти в беспамятстве Протестанты такие же Обратить в истинную веру Вильяма ДжУолша доктора Богословия Ихний бог  Будда что на боку в музее лежит Подложил руку под голову прохлаждается Возжигают куренияНепохоже на   Терновый венец и крестТрилистник  хорошая придумка святого Патрика А едят палочками КонмиМартин Каннингем с ним знаком почтенного вида Надо было к нему пойти когда устраивал Молли в хор а не к этому отцу Фарли что на вид простачок а на самом деле Так учат их Уж этот не отправится крестить негритят пот ручьями солнечные очки А те дивились бы на очки как сверкают Забавно бы поглядеть как они там сидят в кружок развесив толстые губищи и в полном восторге слушают Натюрморт Лакают как молочкоПрохладный запах святых камней влек его Он поднялся по истертым ступеням толкнул дверь и тихонько вошелЧто то тут делается служба какойто общины Жаль что так пустоОтличное укромное местечко где бы пристроиться рядом с приятной девушкойКто мой ближний Часами в тесноте под тягучую музыку Та женщина у вечерней мессы На седьмом небе Женщины стали на колени у своих скамей опустив головы вокруг шей алые ленточки Часть стала на колени у алтарной решетки Священник обходил их шепотом бормоча держа в руках эту штукуВозле каждой он останавливался вынимал причастие стряхивал однудве капли они что в воде и аккуратненько клал ей в рот Ее шляпа и голова дернулись вниз К следующей маленькая старушка Священник наклонился чтобы положить его ей в рот все время продолжая шептать Латынь К следующей Закрой глаза открой рот Что  ТелоТруп Хорошая находка латынь Первым делом их одурманить Приют для умирающих Кажется они это не жуют сразу глотают Дикая идея  есть куски трупа Тото каннибалы клюют на этоОн стоял чуть поодаль глядя как их незрячие маски движутся вереницей по проходу ищут свои места Потом подошел к скамье и сел с краю продолжая держать свои газету и шляпу И что за горшки мы носим Шляпы надо бы делать по форме головы Они были рассеяны вокруг там и сям головы все еще опущены алые ленточки ждут пока это растопится в их желудках Вроде мацы тот же сорт хлеба пресные хлебы предложения Только посмотреть на них Так и видно как счастливы Конфетка Счастливы до предела Да это называется хлеб ангелов За этим большая идея чувствуешь чтото в том роде что Царство Божие внутри нас Первые причастники Чудо для крошек леденец за грошик После этого они все чувствуют себя как одна семья то же самое в театре все заодно Конечно чувствуют я уверен Не так одиноко мы все собратья Потом в приподнятых чувствах Дает разрядкуВо что веришь понастоящему это и существует Исцеления в Лурде воды забвения явление в Ноке кровоточащие статуи Старикан заснул возле исповедальни Оттуда и храп Слепая вера Обеспечил местечко в грядущем царствии Убаюкивает все страдания Разбудите в это же время через годОн увидел как священник убрал чашу с причастием кудато внутрь и на мгновение стал на колени перед ней выставив серую большую подметку изпод кружевного балахона что был на нем А вдруг и у него на одной булавкеКак он домой дойдет Сзади круглая плешь На спине буквы ИНЦИ Нет ИХС Молли мне както объяснила Ищу храм святости  или нет ищу храм страдания вот как А те другие И нас целиком искупилВстретиться в воскресенье после мессы Исполни эту мою просьбуПоявится под вуалью и с черной сумочкой В сумерках и против света Могла бы быть тут с ленточкой на шее и все равно тайком проделывать такие делишки Они способны Тот гусь что выдал непобедимых он каждое утро ходил Кэри его звали к причастию Вот в эту самую церковь Питер КэриНет это у меня Петр Клавер в голове Дэнис Кэри Представить только себеДома жена и шестеро детей И все время готовил это убийство Эти святоши вот самое подходящее для них слово в них всегда чтото скользкое И в делах тоже они виляют Да нет ее нет здесь  цветок  нет нет А кстати конвертто я разорвал Дада под мостомСвященник ополоснул потир потом залпом ловко опрокинул остатки ВиноТак аристократичней чем если бы он пил что уж они там пьют портер Гиннесса или чтонибудь безалкогольное дублинское горькое Уитли или имбирный эль ароматизированный Кантрелла и Кокрейна Им не дает вино предложения только то другое Скупятся Святые мошенники но правильно делают иначе бы все пьянчужки сбегались клянчить Странная атмосфера в этих Правильно делают Совершенно правыМистер Блум оглянулся на хоры Музыки никакой не будет Жаль Кто у них органист Старый Глинн вот тот умел заставить инструмент говорить вибрато  по слухам пятьдесят фунтов в год ему платили на Гардинерстрит В тот день Молли была очень в голосе   Россини Сначала проповедь отца Бернарда ВохенаХристос или Пилат Да Христос только не томи нас всю ночь Вот музыку они хотели Шарканье прекратилось Булавка упадет  слышно Я ей посоветовал направлять голос в тот угол Волнение так и чувствовалось в воздухе на пределе все даже головы подняли  В этой старой церковной музыке есть чудесные вещи Меркаданте семь последних слов Двенадцатая месса Моцарта а из нее   Папы в старину знали толк и в музыке и в искусстве во всяческих статуях картинах Или Палестрина к примеру Пока так было в добрые старые времена славная была жизнь И для здоровья полезно пение правильный режим потом варили ликеры Бенедиктин Зеленый шартрез Но всетаки держать в хоре кастратов это уж чтото слишком А какие это голоса Наверно интересно было слушать после их собственных густых басовЗнатоки Должно быть они после этого ничего не чувствуют Некая безмятежность Не о чем беспокоиться Жиреют что им еще Высокие длинноногие обжоры Кто знает Кастрат Тоже выход из положенияОн увидел как священник нагнулся и поцеловал алтарь потом повернувшись к собравшимся благословил их Все перекрестились и всталиМистер Блум оглянулся по сторонам и тоже встал глядя поверх поднявшихся шляп Встают  это конечно для евангелия Потом все опять стали на колени а он спокойно уселся на скамью Священник сошел с алтарного возвышения держа перед собой предмет и они с прислужником стали друг другу отвечать полатыни Потом священник стал на колени и начал читать по бумажке Господь наше прибежище и сила нашаМистер Блум подался вперед чтобы уловить слова Английский Бросить им кость Еще чтото помню Когда был у мессы последний раз Преславная и непорочная дева Супруг ее Иосиф Петр и Павел Так интересней когда понимаешь о чем все это Блестящая организация это факт работает как часы Исповедь Все стремятся Тогда я скажу тебе все Раскаяние Прошу вас накажите меня Сильнейшее оружие в их руках Сильней чем у доктора или адвоката Женщины просто с ума сходят А я шушушушушушу А вы бубубубубубу Зачем же это вы Разглядывает свое кольцо ищет оправданиеШепчущая галерея у стен есть уши Муж к своему изумлению узнаетГосподь слегка подшутил Потом она выходит Раскаяние на пять минут Мило пристыжена Молитва у алтаря Аве Мария да святая Мария Цветы ладан оплывающие свечи Прячет румянец Армия спасения  жалкая подделка Перед нашим собранием выступит раскаявшаяся блудница Как я обрела Господа В Риме должно быть головастые парни это они ведь заправляют всей лавочкой И денежки хорошие загребают Завещания приходскому священнику в его полное распоряжение Служить мессы за упокой моей души всенародно при открытых дверях Монастыри мужские и женские В деле о завещании Ферманы священник в числе свидетелей Этого не собьешь Ответ заранее на все готов Свобода и возвышение нашей святой матери церкви Учители церкви они на это придумали целое богословиеСвященник молился Блаженный архангеле Михаиле огради нас в час бедствий Сохрани нас от злобы и козней диавола смиренно молим да укротит его Господь и властию Божией о княже воинства небесного низрини его сатану во ад и с ним купно прочих злых бесов кои рыщут по свету погибели ради душ нашихСвященник с прислужником встали и пошли прочь Кончено Женщины еще остались благодарениеПора убираться Брат Обирало Вдруг пойдет с блюдом Вноси свою лептуОн поднялся Эге Это что же две пуговицы на жилете так и были расстегнуты Женщины в таких случаях в восторге Никогда не скажут тебеЛюбят когда у тебя слегка растрепанный вид А уж мыто Простите мисс тут у вас гмм крохотная гмм пушинка Или крючок расстегнется сзади на юбке Проблеск луны Досадуют если ты не Что же ты раньше не сказалХорошо еще тут а не дальше к югу Он прошел меж скамей незаметно застегиваясь на ходу и главною дверью вышел на свет Зажмурясь он остановился на миг возле холодной черной мраморной чаши покуда сзади и спереди от него две богомолки окунали робкие руки в мелководье святой воды Трамваи  фургон из красильни Прескотта  вдовица в трауре Замечаю потому что сам в трауре Он надел шляпу Сколько там набежало ЧетвертьХватает времени Стоит сейчас заказать лосьон Где это Ах да в прошлый раз Свени на Линкольнплейс

Мудрость природы Примерно две недели назад сэр Да  ответил мистер БлумОн ждал у конторки вдыхая едкую вонь лекарств сухой пыльный запах губок и люффы Долгая история выкладывать про свои болячки Миндальное масло и бензойная настойка  сказал мистер Блум  и потом померанцевая водаОт этого лосьона кожа у нее делается нежная и белая точно воск И еще воск  добавил онПодчеркивает темный цвет глаз

нагонят Вот сэр  отыскал аптекарь  Это стоило два и девять А склянка у вас найдется с собой Нет  сказал мистер Блум  Вы приготовьте пожалуйста а я зайду попоздней сегодня И я возьму еще мыло какоенибудь из этих Они почем Четыре пенса сэрМистер Блум поднес кусок к носу Сладковатолимонный воск Вот это я возьму  решил он  Итого будет три и пенни Да сэр  сказал аптекарь  Вы можете заплатить за все сразу когда придете Хорошо  сказал мистер БлумОн вышел из аптеки не торопясь держа под мышкой трубку газеты и в левой руке мыло в прохладной оберткеУ самой подмышки голос и рука Бэнтама Лайонса сказали Приветствую Блум что новенького Это сегодняшняя Вы не покажете на минуткуФу ты опять усы сбрил Длинная холодная верхняя губа Чтобы выглядеть помоложе А выглядит подурацки Он моложе меняПальцы Бэнтама Лайонса желтые с чернотой под ногтями развернули газету Ему бы тоже помыться Содрать корку грязи Доброе утро вы не забыли воспользоваться мылом Пирса По плечам перхоть Череп бы смазывал Хочу взглянуть насчет французской лошадки что сегодня бежит  сказал Бэнтам Лайонс  Черт да где тут онаОн шелестел мятыми страницами ерзая подбородком тудасюда по тугому воротничку Зуд после бритья От такого воротничка волосы будут лезтьОставить ему газету чтоб отвязался Можете взять себе  сказал мистер Блум Аскот Золотой кубок Постойте  бормотал Бэнтам Лайонс  Один моМаксим Второй Я здесь только рекламу смотрел  добавил мистер БлумВнезапно Бэнтам Лайонс поднял на него глаза в которых мелькнуло хитрое выражение Каккак вы сказали  переспросил он отрывисто Я говорю можете взять себе  повторил мистер Блум  Я все равно хотел выбросить только посмотрел рекламуБэнтам Лайонс с тем же выражением в глазах поколебался минуту  потом сунул раскрытые листы обратно мистеру Блуму Ладно рискну  проговорил он  Держите спасибоЕдва не бегом он двинулся в сторону Конвея Прыть как у зайцаМистер Блум усмехнувшись снова сложил листы аккуратным прямоугольником и поместил между ними мыло Дурацкие стали губы Играет на скачках Последнее время просто повальная зараза Мальчишкипосыльные воруют чтобы поставить шесть пенсов Разыгрывается в лотерею отборная нежная индейка Рождественский ужин за три

турецких бань Напоминает мечеть красные кирпичи минареты Я вижу сегодня университетские велогонки Он рассматривал афишу в форме подковы над воротами Колледжпарка велосипедист согнувшийся в три

Джек Волна тепла Не слишком надолго Вечно бегущий поток жизни ищет в потоке жизни наш взгляд что нам дороооже всегоА теперь насладимся баней чистая ванна с водой прохладная эмаль теплый ласкающий поток Сие есть тело моеОн видел заранее свое бледное тело целиком погруженное туда нагое в лоне тепла умащенное душистым тающим мылом мягко омываемое Он видел свое туловище и члены покрытые струйной рябью невесомо зависшие слегка увлекаемые вверх лимонножелтые свой пуп завязь плоти и видел как струятся темные спутанные пряди поросли и струятся пряди потока вокруг поникшего отца тысяч вяло колышущегося цветкаЭпизод Мартин Каннингем первый просунул оцилиндренную голову внутрь скрипучей кареты и ловко войдя уселся За ним шагнул мистер Пауэр пригибаясь изза своего роста Садитесь Саймон После вас  сказал мистер БлумМистер Дедал надел живо шляпу и поднялся в карету проговорив Дада Все уже здесь  спросил Мартин Каннингем  Забирайтесь БлумМистер Блум вошел и сел на свободное место Потом взялся за дверцу и плотно притянул ее пока она не закрылась плотно Продел руку в петлю и с серьезным видом посмотрел через открытое окошко кареты на спущенные шторы соседских окон Одна отдернута старуха глазеет Приплюснула нос к стеклу побелел Благодарит небо что не ее черед Поразительно какой у них интерес к трупам Рады нас проводить на тот свет так тяжко родить на этотЗанятие в самый раз по ним Шушуканье по углам Шмыгают неслышно в шлепанцах боятся еще проснется Потом прибрать его Положить на столМолли и миссис Флеминг стелют ложе Подтяните слегка к себе Наш саван Не узнаешь кто тебя мертвого будет трогать Обмыть тело голову Ногти и волосы кажется подрезают Часть на память в конвертик Потом все равно отрастают Нечистое занятиеВсе ждали не говоря ни слова Наверно венки выносят На чтото твердое сел А это мыло в заднем кармане Лучше убрать оттуда Подожди случаяВсе ждали Потом спереди донеслись звуки колес  ближе  потом стук копыт Тряхнуло Карета тронулась скрипя и покачиваясь Послышались другие копыта и скрипучие колеса сзади Проплыли соседские окна и номер девятый с открытой дверью с крепом на дверном молотке ШагомОни еще выжидали с подпрыгивающими коленями покуда не повернули и не поехали вдоль трамвайной линии Трайтонвиллроуд Быстрей Колеса застучали по булыжной мостовой и расшатанные стекла запрыгали стуча в рамах По какой это он дороге  спросил мистер Пауэр в оба окошка Айриштаун  ответил Мартин Каннингем  Рингсенд БрансвикстритМистер Дедал поглядев наружу кивнул Хороший старый обычай  сказал он  Отрадно что еще не забытС минуту все смотрели в окна на фуражки и шляпы приподнимаемые прохожими Дань уважения Карета миновав Уотерилейн свернула с рельсов на более гладкую дорогу Взгляд мистера Блума заметил стройного юношу в трауре и широкополой шляпе Тут мимо один ваш друг Дедал  сказал он Кто это Ваш сын и наследник Где он там  спросил мистер Дедал перегибаясь к окну напротивКарета миновав улицу с доходными домами и развороченной в канавах и ямах мостовой свернула накренившись за угол и снова покатила вдоль рельсов громко стуча колесами Мистер Дедал откинулся назад и спросил А этот прохвост Маллиган тоже с ним Его   Да нет он один  ответил мистер Блум От тетушки Салли надо думать  сказал мистер Дедал  Эта шайка Гулдингов пьяненький счетоводишка и Крисси папочкина вошкасикушка то мудрое дитя что узнает отцаМистер Блум бесстрастно усмехнулся глядя на Рингсендроуд Братья Уоллес производство бутылок Мост ДоддерРичи Гулдинг с портфелем стряпчего Гулдинг Коллис и Уорд так он всем называет фирму Его шуточки уже сильно с бородой А был хоть кудаВоскресным утром танцевал на улице вальс с Игнатием Галлахером на Стеймерстрит напялив две хозяйкины шляпы на голову Ночи напролет куролесил Теперь начинает расплачиваться боюсь что эта его боль в пояснице Жена утюжит спину Думает вылечиться пилюльками А в них один хлеб Процентов шестьсот чистой прибыли Связался со всяким сбродом  продолжал сварливо мистер Дедал  Этот Маллиган вам любой скажет это отпетый бандит насквозь испорченный тип От одного его имени воняет по всему Дублину Но с помощью Божией и Пресвятой Девы я им особо займусь я напишу его матери или тетке или кто она там ему такое письмо что у нее глаза полезут на лоб Я тыл ему коленом почешу могу вас заверитьОн силился перекричать громыханье колес Я не позволю чтобы этот ублюдок ее племянничек губил бы моего сына Отродье зазывалы из лавки Шнурки продает у моего родича Питера Пола Максвайни Не выйдетОн смолк Мистер Блум перевел взгляд с его сердитых усов на кроткое лицо мистера Пауэра потом на глаза и бороду Мартина Каннингема которые солидно покачивались Шумливый человек своевольный Носится со своим сыном И правильно Чтото после себя оставить Если бы Руди малютка остался жить Видеть как он растет Слышать голосок в доме Как идет рядом с Молли в итонской курточке Мой сын Я в его глазах Странное было бы ощущение От меня Слепой случай Это видно тем утром на Реймондтеррас она из окна глядела как две собаки случаются под стеной не содейте зла И сержант ухмылялся Она была в том палевом халате с прорехой так и не собралась зашить Польди давай мы Ох я так хочу умираю Так начинается жизньПотом в положении Пришлось отменить концерт в Грейстоуне Мой сын в ней Я мог бы его поставить на ноги Мог бы Сделать самостоятельным Немецкому научить Мы не опаздываем  спросил мистер Пауэр На десять минут  сказал Мартин Каннингем посмотрев на часыМолли Милли То же самое но пожиже Ругается как мальчишка Катись колбаской Чертики с рожками Нет она милая девчушка Станет уж скоро женщиной Моллингар Дражайший папулька Студент Да да тоже женщина Жизнь ЖизньКарету качнуло взадвперед и с ней четыре их ту лова Корни мог бы нам дать какуюнибудь колымагу поудобней  заметил мистер Пауэр Мог бы  сказал мистер Дедал  если бы он так не косил Вы меня понимаетеОн прищурил левый глаз Мартин Каннингем начал смахивать хлебные крошки со своего сиденья Что это еще Боже милостивый  проговорил он  Крошки Похоже что ктото тут устраивал недавно пикник  сказал мистер ПауэрВсе привстали недовольно оглядывая прелую с оборванными пуговицами кожу сидений Мистер Дедал покрутил носом глядя вниз поморщился и сказал Или я сильно ошибаюсь Как вам кажется Мартин Я и сам поразился  сказал Мартин КаннингемМистер Блум опустился на сиденье Удачно что зашел в баню Ноги чувствуешь совершенно чистыми Вот только бы еще миссис Флеминг заштопала эти носки получшеМистер Дедал отрешенно вздохнув сказал В конце концов это самая естественная вещь на свете А Том Кернан появился  спросил Мартин Каннингем слегка теребя кончик бороды Да  ответил мистер Блум  Он едет за нами с Хайнсом и с Недом Лэмбертом А сам Корни Келлехер  спросил мистер Пауэр На кладбище  сказал Мартин Каннингем Я встретил утром Маккоя  сообщил мистер Блум  и он сказал тоже постарается приехатьКарета резко остановилась Что там такое Застряли Где мыМистер Блум высунул голову из окна Большой канал  сказал онГазовый завод Говорят вылечивает коклюш Повезло что у Милли этого не было Бедные дети Сгибаются пополам в конвульсиях синеют чернеютПросто кошмар С болезнями сравнительно легко обошлось Одна корь Чай из льняного семени Скарлатина эпидемии

могиле Предсмертные каракули Он себе места не находил тосковал Смирный пес У стариков обычно такиеКапля дождя упала ему на шляпу Он спрятал голову и увидел как серые плиты моментально усеялись темными

мистер ПауэрМистер Дедал поглядев вслед ковыляющей фигуре пожелал кротко Чтоб тебе сатана пропорол печенкиМистер Пауэр зашедшись неудержимым смехом заслонил лицо от окна когда карета проезжала статую Грэя Мы все это испытали  заметил неопределенно Мартин КаннингемГлаза его встретились с глазами мистера Блума Погладив свою бороду он добавил Ну скажем почти все из насМистер Блум заговорил с внезапною живостью вглядываясь в лица спутников Это просто отличная история что ходит насчет Рувима Дж и его сына Про лодочника  спросил мистер Пауэр Дада Отличная ведь история А что там  спросил мистер Дедал  Я не слышал Там возникла какаято девица  начал мистер Блум  и он решил услать его от греха подальше на остров Мэн но когда они оба Чточто  переспросил мистер Дедал  Это этот окаянный уродец Ну да  сказал мистер Блум  Они оба уже шли на пароход и тот вдруг в воду Варавва в воду  воскликнул мистер Дедал  Экая жалость не утонулМистер Пауэр снова зашелся смехом выпуская воздух через заслоненные ноздри Да нет  принялся объяснять мистер Блум  это сынМартин Каннингем бесцеремонно вмешался в его речь Рувим Дж с сыном шли по набережной реки к пароходу на остров Мэн и тут вдруг юный

серьезный вид  сказал Мартин КаннингемМистер Дедал вздохнул Бедняга Падди не стал бы ворчать на нас что мы посмеялись В свое время сам порассказывал хороших историй Да простит мне Бог  проговорил мистер Пауэр вытирая влажные глаза пальцами  Бедный Падди Не думал я неделю назад когда его встретил последний раз и был он как всегда здоровехонек что буду ехать за ним вот так Ушел от нас Из всех кто только носил шляпу на голове самый достойный крепышок  выразился мистер Дедал  Ушел в одночасье Удар  молвил Мартин Каннингем  СердцеПечально он похлопал себя по грудиЛицо как распаренное багровое Злоупотреблял горячительным Средство от красноты носа Пей до чертиков покуда не станет трупносерым Порядком он денег потратил чтоб перекраситьМистер Пауэр смотрел на проплывающие дома со скорбным

сказал мистер Пауэр  это когда человек кончает с собойМартин Каннингем быстрым движением вынул часы кашлянул спрятал часы обратно И это такое бесчестье если у когото в семье  продолжал мистер Пауэр Временное умопомрачение разумеется  решительно произнес Мартин Каннингем  Надо к этому относиться с милосердием Говорят тот кто так поступает трус  сказал мистер Дедал Не нам судить  возразил Мартин КаннингемМистер Блум собравшись было заговорить снова сомкнул уста Большие глаза Мартина Каннингема Сейчас отвернулся Гуманный сострадательный человек И умный На Шекспира похож Всегда найдет доброе слово А у них никакой жалости насчет этого и насчет детоубийства тоже Лишают христианского погребения Раньше загоняли в могилу кол в сердце ему Как будто и так уже не разбито Но иногда те раскаиваются

обмахивая хвостами загаженные костлявые крупы По бокам и в гуще гурта трусили меченые овцы блея от страха Эмигранты  сказал мистер Пауэр Гей Гей  покрикивал голос скотогона бич его щелкал по их бокам

Можно было бы весь этот скот доставлять вагонами прямо на пароходы Чем загораживать движение  поддержал Мартин Каннингем  Очень правильно Так и надо бы сделать Да  продолжал мистер Блум  и еще другое я часто думаю это чтобы устроили похоронные трамваи знаете как в Милане Провести линию до кладбища и пустить специальные трамваи катафалк траурный кортеж все как положено Вы понимаете мою идею Ну это уж анекдот какойто  молвил мистер Дедал  Вагон спальный и вагонресторан Печальные перспективы для Корни  добавил мистер Пауэр Почему же  возразил мистер Блум оборачиваясь к мистеру Дедалу  Разве не будет это приличней чем трястись вот так парами нос к носу Ну ладно может тут и есть чтото  снизошел мистер Дедал И к тому же  сказал Мартин Каннингем  мы бы избавились от сцен вроде той когда катафалк перевернулся у Данфи и опрокинул гроб на дорогу Совершенно ужасный случай  сказало потрясенное лицо мистера Пауэра И труп вывалился на мостовую Ужасно Первым на повороте у Данфи  одобрительно кивнул мистер Дедал  На кубок Гордона Беннета Господи помилуй  произнес набожно Мартин КаннингемТрах На попа Гроб грохается об мостовую Крышка долой Падди Дигнам вылетает и катится в пыли как колода в

лучшее закрыть все отверстия Ага и там Воском Сфинктер расслабляется Все заткнуть Данфи  объявил мистер Пауэр когда карета повернула направоПерекресток Данфи Стоят траурные кареты залить горе Придорожный привал Для трактира идеальное место Наверняка заглянем на обратном пути пропустить за его здоровье Чаша утешения Эликсир жизниА допустим правда случилось бы Пошла бы у него кровь скажем

 Жуткая история Братоубийство Так считали по крайней мере А Сеймур Буш его вытянул Улик не было  сказал мистер Пауэр Одни косвенные  сказал Мартин Каннингем  Таков принцип правосудия Пусть лучше

во внутренний карман с носовым платком Он вышел сунув обратно газету которую все еще держала другая рукаУбогие похороны три кареты и катафалк Какая разница Факельщики золоченая сбруя заупокойная месса артиллерийский салют Смерть с помпойУ последней кареты стоял разносчик с лотком фруктов и пирожков Черствые пирожки ссохлись вместе пирожки для покойников Собачья радость Кто их ест Те кто обратно с кладбищаОн шел за своими спутниками позади мистер Кернан и Нед Лэмберт за ними Хайнс Корни Келлехер стоявший у открытого катафалка взял два венка и передал один мальчикуА куда же делись те детские похороныУпряжка лошадей со стороны Фингласроуд натужно тащила в похоронном молчании скрипучую телегу с глыбой гранита Шагавший впереди возчик снял шапкуТеперь гроб Хоть мертвый а поспел раньше Лошадь

гроб и понесли в ворота Мертвый вес больше Я сам себя чувствовал тяжелей когда вылезал из ванны Сначала труп потом друзья трупа За гробом с венками шли Корни Келлехер и мальчик А кто это рядом с ними Ах да своякВсе двигались следомМартин Каннингем зашептал Я так и обомлел когда вы при Блуме начали о самоубийствах Чточто  зашептал мистер Пауэр  А почему Его отец отравился  шептал Мартин Каннингем  Он был хозяин отеля Куинз в Эннисе Слышали он сказал он едет в Клэр Годовщина О Господи  шептал мистер Пауэр  В первый раз слышу ОтравилсяОн оглянулся туда где в сторону усыпальницы кардинала двигалось лицо с темными задумчивыми глазами Беседуя А он был застрахован  спросил мистер Блум Кажется да  отвечал мистер Кернан  но только он заложил свой полис Мартин хлопочет чтобы младшего устроить в Артейн А сколько всего детишек Пятеро Нед Лэмберт обещает устроить одну из девочек к Тодду Печальный случай  с сочувствием произнес мистер Блум  Пятеро маленьких детей А какой удар для жены  добавил мистер Кернан Еще бы  согласился мистер БлумЧихала она теперь на негоОн опустил взгляд на свои начищенные ботинки Она пережила егоОвдовела Для нее он мертвее чем для меня Всегда один должен пережить другого Мудрецы говорят Женщин на свете больше мужчин меньше Выразить ей соболезнование Ваша ужасная утрата Надеюсь вы вскоре последуете за ним Это только вдовы индусов Она может выйти за другого За него НетХотя кто знает Вдовство больше не в чести как старая королева умерлаВезли на лафете Виктория и Альберт Траурная церемония во Фрогморе Но в конце она себе позволила парочку фиалок на

Комуто уйти первым  в одиночку под землю  и не лежать уж в ее теплой постели Как поживаете Саймон  тихо спросил Нед Лэмберт пожимая руку  Не виделись с вами целую вечность Лучше не бывает А что новенького в нашем преславном Корке Я ездил туда на скачки на светлой неделе  сказал Нед Лэмберт  Нового одно старое Остановился у Дика Тайви И как там наш Дик честняга Как есть ничего между ним и небом  выразился Нед Лэмберт Силы небесные  ахнул мистер Дедал в тихом изумлении  Дик Тайви облысел Мартин Каннингем пустил подписной лист в пользу ребятни  сказал Нед Лэмберт кивнув вперед  По нескольку шиллингов с души Чтобы им продержаться пока получат страховку Дада  произнес неопределенно мистер Дедал  Это что старший там впереди Да  сказал Нед Лэмберт  и брат жены За ними Джон Генри Ментон Он уже подписался на фунт Я был всегда в нем уверен  заявил мистер Дедал  Сколько раз я говорил Падди чтоб он держался за ту работу Джон Генри  это не худшее что бывает А как он потерял это место  спросил Нед Лэмберт  Попивал чересчур Грешок многих добрых людей  со вздохом молвил мистер ДедалОни остановились у входа в часовню Мистер Блум стоял позади мальчика с венком глядя вниз на его прилизанные волосы и тонкую с ложбинкой шею в новеньком тесном воротничке Бедный мальчуган Был ли он при этом когда отец Оба без сознания В последний миг приходит в себя и узнает всех в последний раз Все что он мог бы сделать Я должен три шиллинга ОГрэдиПонимал ли он Служители внесли гроб в часовню Где голова у негоЧерез мгновение он прошел за другими моргая после яркого света Гроб стоял перед алтарем на подставке по углам четыре высокие желтые свечиВсегда впереди нас Корни Келлехер прислонив венки у передних углов знаком указал мальчику стать на колени Вошедшие стали там и сям на колени у мест для молящихся Мистер Блум стоял позади невдалеке от купели и когда все стали на колени аккуратно уронил из кармана развернутую газету и стал на нее правым коленом На левое колено он осторожно поместил свою шляпу и придерживая ее за поля благочестиво склонил головуИз дверей появился служка неся медное ведерко с чемто внутри За ним шел священник в белом одной рукой поправляя столу другой придерживая маленькую книжицу у своего жабьего брюха А кто будет нам читать Каркнул ворон я опятьОни стали у гроба и священник принялся быстро каркать по своей книжкеОтец Гробби Я помню както похоже на гроб  Здоровенная морда Заправляет спектаклем Дюжий христианин Горе тому кто на него косо глянет священник Ты еси ПетрОтъел бока как баран на клевере сказал бы Дедал И брюхо раздулось как у дохлого пса Где он такие выражения находит диву даешься Пуфф бока лопаются        Дает им чувство собственной важности когда над ними молятся полатыниЗаупокойная месса Все в трауре рыдают Бумага с траурной

капусты Может быть тут воздух такой На вид как будто раздут от газов В таком месте должна быть адская пропасть газов Мясников взять сами становятся как сырые бифштексы Кто мне рассказывал Мервин Браун В крипте святой Верберги у них чудный орган старинный полтораста лет им там пришлось пробуравить дырки в гробах чтобы газы выпустить и поджечь Со свистом вырывается синий Свистнуло  и тебя нетКолено больно Ох Вот так лучшеСвященник взял из служкиного ведерка палку с шишкой на конце и помахал ей над гробом Потом пошел в ноги гроба помахал там Вернулся на место и положил ее обратно в ведерко Каким и был покуда не упокоился Это все записано он это все обязан проделать      Служка вторил ему писклявым дискантом Я часто думал что лучше брать прислугу из мальчиков Лет до пятнадцати Старше уже конечноА там святая вода должно быть Окропляет сном Небось уже обрыдло ему махать махалкой над всеми трупами что подвозят Пускай бы полюбовался над чем он машет Каждый божий день свежая порция мужчины средних лет старухи дети женщины умершие родами бородачи лысые бизнесмены чахоточные девицы с цыплячьими грудками Круглый год бормочет над ними одно и то же потом покропит водой спите Сейчас вот Дигнама  Говорит он пойдет в рай или уже в раю Над каждым повторяет Нудное дело Но чтото он должен говоритьСвященник закрыл книжку и вышел служка за ним Корни Келлехер открыл боковые двери и вошли могильщики Они снова подняли гроб вынесли его и опустили на свою каталку Корни Келлехер дал один венок мальчику другой свояку и все следом за ними вышли через боковые двери на воздух теплый и пасмурный Мистер Блум вышел последним сунув обратно в карман сложенную газету Взор его оставался чинно потуплен пока каталка с гробом не повернула налево Железные колеса визгливо скрежетнули по гравию и отряд тупоносых башмаков двинулся за каталкой по аллее могилТари тара тари тара тару Батюшки тут разве можно петь Мавзолей ОКоннелла  сказал Дедал рядом с нимКроткие глаза мистера Пауэра поднялись к вершине высокого обелиска Тут он покоится  произнес он  среди своего народа старый Дэн ОНо сердце его погребено в Риме А сколько разбитых сердец погребено тут Саймон Там вон ее могила Джек  сказал мистер Дедал  Скоро и я лягу рядом Да призовет Он меня когда будет воля ЕгоНе удержавшись он начал тихо всхлипывать бредя неровной оступающейся походкой Мистер Пауэр взял его под руку Ей лучше там где она сейчас  мягко промолвил он Да я знаю  ответил сдавленно мистер Дедал  Она сейчас на небе если только есть небоКорни Келлехер шагнул в сторону и пропустил остальных вперед Печальные события  учтиво заговорил мистер КернанМистер Блум прикрыл глаза и дважды скорбно покивал головой Все остальные надели шляпы  заметил мистер Кернан  Я думаю и нам тоже стоит Мы последние Это кладбище коварное местоОни покрыли головы А вам не кажется что его преподобие отслужил слишком скоропалительно  сказал с неодобрением мистер КернанМистер Блум солидно кивнул глянув в живые глаза с красными прожилкамиСкрытные глаза скрытные и обыскивающие Видимо масон точно не знаюОпять рядом с ним Мы последние В равном положении Авось он чтонибудь еще скажетМистер Кернан добавил Служба Ирландской Церкви на Иеронимовой Горе и проще и более впечатляет я должен это сказатьМистер Блум выразил сдержанное согласие Язык конечно многое значитМистер Кернан торжественно произнес Я есмь воскресение и жизнь  Это проникает до самой глубины сердца Действительно  сказал мистер БлумТвоего то может и да но какой прок малому в ящике шесть футов на два с цветочком из пятки Ему проникает Седалище страстей Разбитое сердце В конечном счете насос качает каждый день сотни галлонов крови Потом в один прекрасный день закупорка и ты с концами Их тут вокруг навалом кишки печенки сердца Старые ржавые насосы и ни черта большеВоскресение и жизнь Уж если умер так умер Или идея насчет страшного суда Всех вытряхнуть из могил Лазарь иди вон А пошла вонь и трюк провалился Подъем Страшный суд И все шныряют как мыши разыскивают свои печенки и селезенки и прочие потроха Чтоб все до крохи собрал за утро так твою и растак Ползолотника праху в черепе Двенадцать гран ползолотника Тройская мераКорни Келлехер пристроился к ним Все было экстракласс  сказал он  АОн искоса поглядел на них тягучим взглядом Грудь полисмена С твоим труляля труляля Как полагается  согласился мистер Кернан Что А  переспросил Корни КеллехерМистер Кернан повторил А кто это позади нас с Томом Кернаном  спросил Джон Генри Ментон  Лицо знакомоеНед Лэмберт мельком оглянулся назад Блум  ответил он  Мадам Мэрион Твиди та что была вернее она и есть певица сопрано Это жена его А вон что  протянул Джон Генри Ментон  Давненько я ее не видал Была эффектная женщина Я танцевал с ней постойка тому назад пятнадцать  семнадцать золотых годиков у Мэта Диллона в Раундтауне Было что подержать в рукахОн оглянулся в конец процессии А что он такое Чем занимается Он не был в писчебумажной торговлеПомню я с ним расплевался както вечером в кегельбанеНед Лэмберт усмехнулся Ну как же был Пропагандист промокашек Бога ради  посетовал Джон Генри Ментон  и что она вышла за этого гуся лапчатого Ведь какая была с изюминкой с огоньком Такой пока и осталась  заверил Нед Лэмберт  А он сейчас рекламный агентБольшие выпуклые глаза Джона Генри Ментона глядели неподвижно впередТележка свернула в боковую аллею Солидный мужчина выступил из засады за кустами и снял шляпу Могильщики тронули свои кепки Джон ОКоннелл  сказал мистер Пауэр довольный  Никогда не забудет другаМистер ОКоннелл молча пожал всем руки Мистер Дедал сказал Я снова с визитом к вам Любезный Саймон  произнес негромко смотритель  я совсем не желаю вас в свои завсегдатаиПоклонившись Неду Лэмберту и Джону Генри Ментону он пошел рядом с Мартином Каннингемом позвякивая связкой ключей у себя за спиной А вы не слышали историю  спросил он у всех  насчет Малкэхи из Кума Я не слыхал  ответил Мартин КаннингемВсе дружно склонили к нему цилиндры Хайнс тоже подставил ухоСмотритель подцепил большими пальцами золотую цепочку от часов и деликатно понизив голос заговорил обращаясь к их выжидательным улыбкам Рассказывают будто бы двое дружков подвыпив в один туманный вечер заявились сюда навестить могилу приятеля Спросили где тут лежит Малкэхи из Кума им объяснили куда идти Нус проплутав сколькото в тумане они находят могилу Один из пьяниц читает по буквам Теренс Малкэхи Другой в это время хлопает глазами на статую Спасителя которую вдова заказала и поставилаСмотритель похлопал глазами на один из попутных памятников Потом снова продолжал Ну поморгал он поморгал на божественную статую и говорит Да ни хрена он не похож на нашего Малкэхи Какойто сапожник делал ни малейшего сходства Вознагражденный улыбками он пропустил их вперед и принялся тихо толковать с Корни Келлехером забирая у него квитанции листая и проглядывая их на ходу Это он специально  объяснил Мартин Каннингем Хайнсу Знаю  ответил Хайнс  я раскусил Подбодрить публику  сказал Мартин Каннингем  Из чистой доброты ничего другогоМистера Блума восхищала осанистая фигура смотрителя С ним все хотят быть в хороших отношениях Глубоко порядочный человек Джон ОКоннелл отличной выпечки Ключи  как реклама для Ключчи  нет опасения что ктото сбежит на выходе не проверяем Хабеат корпус После похорон надо заняться этой рекламой Кажется я написал Боллсбридж на том конверте которым прикрыл листок когда она вдруг вошла а я писал Марте Еще застрянет как неверно заадресованное Не мешало бы побриться Щетина седая Это первый признак когда волос седеет у корней Еще характер портится И в седых волосах уж блестит серебро Интересно что чувствует его жена Как у него хватило духу сделать комуто предложение Пошли будешь жить на кладбище Огорошить ее этим Сначала может это ее возбудит Смерть в ухажерах Тут всюду ночные тени роятся при таком множестве мертвецов Тени могил когда скрипят гроба и Дэниэл ОКоннелл наверно он потомок его кто ж это уверял будто он был со странностями и любвеобилен на редкость но все равно великий католик как огромный гигант во тьме Блуждающие огоньки Могильные газы Ей надо отвлекать мысли от этого а то не сможет зачать Женщины особенно впечатлительны Рассказать ей в постели историю с привидениями чтоб заснула Ты видела когданибудь привидение Знаешь а я видел Стояла тьма хоть глаз выколи Часы пробили двенадцать Но могут и целоваться со всем пылом стоит только настроить В Турции шлюхи на кладбищах Если взять молодую чему угодно научитсяМожешь тут подцепить молодую вдовушку Мужчинам такое нравится Любовь среди могил Ромео Обостряет удовольствие В расцвете смерти объяты мы жизнью Крайности сходятся Танталовы муки для бедных мертвецов Запахи жареных бифштексов для голодных Гложущих собственные потроха Желание подразнить других Молли хотелось заняться любовью перед окном Как бы там ни было восемь детей у негоОн тут насмотрелся вдоволь на уходящих в землю укладывает ими участок за участком вокруг Святые поля Больше было бы места если хоронить стояСидя или же на коленях не выйдет Стоя В один прекрасный день оползень или что вдруг голова показывается наружу и протянутая рука Тут вся земля кругом наверное как соты продолговатые ячейки Содержит все в чистоте бордюры трава подрезана Майор Гэмбл называет Иеронимову Гору мой сад А что верно Должны быть сонные цветы Мастянский говорил в Китае гигантские маки на кладбищах дают самый лучший опиум Ботанический сад тут недалеко Кровь впитывается в землю дает новую жизнь Та же идея у тех евреев что говорят убили христианского мальчика Каждому человеку своя цена Хорошо сохранившийся жирный труп джентльменаэпикурейца необходим для вашего сада Цена дешевая Туша Вильяма Уилкинсона ревизора и бухгалтера недавно скончавшегося три фунта тринадцать и шесть Рады служить вамМожно ручаться почва тучнеет на славу от трупного удобрения кости мясо ногти Начинка склепов Жуть Делаются зеленые и розовые разлагаются В сырой земле гниют быстро Тощие старики дольше держатсяСтановятся не то сальные не то творожистые Потом чернеют сочатся черной вонючей патокой Потом высыхают Мотыльки смерти Конечно клетки или что там есть живут дальше Изменяются но по сути вечные Нечем кормиться кормятся собойНа них ведь должна развестись чертова погибель червей Должно быть в почве так и кишат так и кружат Вскрюжат голову бедняжке Щечки в ямочках кудряшки А вид у него вполне бодрый Дает ему ощущение власти видеть как все уходят в землю раньше него Интересно как он смотрит на жизнь Не прочь пошутить отвести душу Анекдотсообщение Сперджен отправился на небо сегодня утром в  часа Сейчас  вечера время закрытия Еще не прибыл Петр Мертвецы и сами по крайней мере мужчины вполне бы послушали анекдотец а женщинам бы разузнать насчет моды Сочную грушу или дамский пунш крепкий сладкий горячий Предохраняет от сырости Смеяться полезно так что это самое лучшее когда в таком стиле Могильщики в Гамлете говорит о глубоком знании наших душ О мертвых нельзя шутить по крайней мере два года      Сначала чтобы кончился траур Трудно представить себе его похороны Как будто каламбур Говорят прочесть собственный некролог будешь жить дольше Дает второе дыхание Новый контракт на жизнь Сколько у нас на завтра  спросил смотритель Двое  ответил Корни Келлехер  В полодиннадцатого и в одиннадцатьСмотритель сунул бумаги в карман Колеса каталки остановилисьПрисутствующие разделившись пройдя осторожно между могил стали по обе стороны ямы Могильщики сняли гроб и поставили его носом на край подведя снизу веревкиХороним его Днесь Цезаря пришли мы хоронить Его мартовские или июньские иды Он не знает кто тут и ему все равноНет а этото еще кто этот долговязый раззява в макинтоше Нет правда кто хочу знать Нет грош я дам за то чтоб узнать Всегда ктонибудь объявится о ком ты отродясь не слыхивал Человек может всю жизнь прожить в одиночестве А что может Но всетаки ктото ему нужен кто бы его зарыл хотя могилу он себе может выкопать сам Это мы все делаем Только человек погребает Нет еще муравьи Первое что всех поражает Хоронить мертвыхГоворят Робинзон Крузо был на самом деле Тогда стало быть Пятница его и похоронил Каждая Пятница хоронит четверг если так поглядетьО бедный Крузо РобинзонИ как же смог прожить там онБедный Дигнам Последнее земное ложе его в этом ящике Как подумаешь сколько их кажется такой тратой дерева Все равно сгложут А можно было бы придумать нарядный гроб с какойто скажем панелью чтобы с нее соскальзывали Эх только будут возражать чтобы их хоронили в изпод другого Страшная привередливость Положите меня в родной земле Горсточку глины из Палестины Только мать и мертворожденного могут похоронить в одном гробу А я понимаю почему Понимаю Чтобы его защищать как можно дольше даже в земле Дом ирландца его гроб Бальзамирование в катакомбах мумии тот же смыслМистер Блум стоял поодаль со шляпой в руках считая обнаженные головыДвенадцать я тринадцатый Нет Чудик в макинтоше тринадцатый Число смерти И откуда он выскочил В часовне не было за это я поручусьГлупейший предрассудок насчет тринадцатиХороший твид мягкий у Неда Лэмберта на костюме Красноватая искра У меня был похожий когда жили на Западной Ломбардстрит Раньше он был большой щеголь Три раза на день менял костюм А мой серый надо снести к Мизайесу чтоб перелицевал Эге Да он перекрашен Надо бы его жене хотя у него нет жены или там хозяйке повыдергивать эти ниткиГроб уходил из вида могильщики спускали его крепко уперев ноги на подгробных подпорах Они выпрямились и отошли и все обнажили головыДвадцатьПаузаЕсли бы все мы вдруг стали кемто ещеВдалеке проревел осел К дождю Не такой уж осел Говорят никогда не увидишь мертвого осла Стыд смерти Прячутся Бедный папа тоже уехалЛегкий ветерок овевал обнаженные головы шепча Шепот Мальчик возле могилы держал обеими руками венок покорно глядя в открытый черный провалМистер Блум стал позади осанистого и благожелательного смотрителя Фрак хорошо пошит Прикидывает наверно кто из нас следующий Что ж это долгий отдых Ничего не чувствуешь Только сам момент чувствуешь Должно быть чертовски неприятно Сперва не можешь поверить Должно быть ошибка это не меня Спросите в доме напротив Обождите я хотел то Я не успел этоПотом затемненная палата для смертников Им хочется света Кругом перешептываются Вы не хотите позвать священника Потом бессвязная речь мысли путаются Бред все что ты скрывал всю жизнь Борьба со смертью Это у него не естественный сон Оттяните нижнее веко Смотрят а нос заострился а челюсть отвисла а подошвы ног пожелтели Заберите подушку и пусть кончается на полу все равно обречен На той картинке смерть грешника ему дьявол показывает женщину И он умирающий в рубашке тянется ее обнятьПоследний акт Лючии Ужель никогда не увижу тебя Бамм Испустил духОтошел наконецто Люди слегка поговорят о тебе  и забудут Не забывайте молиться о нем Поминайте его в своих молитвах Даже Парнелл День плюща отмирает Потом и сами за ним один за другим все в ямуМы сейчас молимся за упокой его души Три к носу брат и не угоди в адПриятная перемена климата Со сковородки жизни в огонь чистилищаА думает он когданибудь про яму ждущую его самого Говорят про это думаешь если внезапно дрожь проберет в жаркий день Ктото прошел по твоей могиле Предупреждение скоро на выход За другими Моя в том конце к Фингласу участок что я купил Мама бедная мамочка и малютка РудиМогильщики взялись за лопаты и начали швырять на гроб тяжелые комья глины Мистер Блум отвернул лицо А если он все это время был жив БррВот это уж было бы ужасно Нет нет он мертвый конечно Конечно мертвыйВ понедельник умер Надо бы какойто закон чтобы протыкать им сердце для верности или электрический звонок в гробу или телефон и какуюнибудь решетку для доступа воздуха Сигнал бедствия Три дня Летом это довольно долго Пожалуй лучше сразу сплавлять как только уверились что неГлина падала мягче Начинают забывать С глаз долой из сердца вонСмотритель отошел в сторону и надел шляпу С него хватит Провожающие понемногу приободрились и неприметно один за другим тоже покрывали головы Мистер Блум надел шляпу и увидел как осанистая фигура споро прокладывает путь в лабиринте могил Спокойно с хозяйской уверенностью пересекал он поля скорби Хайнс чтото строчит в блокнотике А имена Он же их все знает Нет идет ко мне Я тут записываю имена и фамилии  полушепотом сказал Хайнс  Ваше как имя Я не совсем помню На эл  отвечал мистер Блум  Леопольд И можете еще записать Маккоя Он меня попросил Чарли  произнес Хайнс записывая  Знаю его Он когдато работал во ФрименеВерно работал до того как устроился в морге под началом Луиса БернаХорошая мысль чтобы доктора делали посмертные вскрытия Выяснить то что им кажется они и так знают Он скончался от Вторника Намазал пятки Смылся прихватив выручку с нескольких объявлений Чарли ты моя душка Потому он меня и попросил Ладно кому от этого вред Я все сделал Маккой Спасибо старина премного обязан Вот и пускай будет обязан  а мне ничего не стоит И скажитека  продолжал Хайнс  вы не знаете этого типа ну там вон стоял еще на немОн поискал глазами вокруг Макинтош  сказал мистер Блум  Да я его видел Куда же он делся Макинтош  повторил Хайнс записывая  Не знаю кто он такой Это его фамилияОн двинулся дальше оглядываясь по сторонам Да нет  начал мистер Блум оборачиваясь задержать его  Нет же ХайнсНе слышит А Куда же тот испарился Ни следа Ну что же из всех ктоНе видали Ка е два эл Стал невидимкой Господи что с ним сталосьСедьмой могильщик подошел к мистеру Блуму взять лежавшую рядом с ним лопату О извинитеОн поспешно посторонилсяБурая сырая глина уже видна была в яме Она поднималась Вровень Гора сырых комьев росла все выше росла и могильщики опустили свои лопаты На минуту все опять обнажили головы Мальчик прислонил венок сбоку свояк положил свой сверху Могильщики надели кепки и понесли обглиненные лопаты к тележке Постукали лезвием по земле очистили Один нагнулся и снял с черенка длинный пучок травы Еще один отделился от товарищей и медленно побрел прочь взяв на плечо оружие с синеблещущим лезвием Другой в головах могилы медленно сматывал веревки на которых спускали гроб Его пуповина Свояк отвернувшись чтото вложил в его свободную рукуБезмолвная благодарность Сочувствуем сэр такое горе Кивок ПонимаюВот лично вамУчастники похорон разбредались медленно бесцельно окольными тропками задерживались у могил прочесть имена Давайте кругом мимо могилы вождя  предложил Хайнс  Время есть Давайте  сказал мистер ПауэрОни свернули направо следуя медленному течению своих мыслей Тусклый голос мистера Пауэра с суеверным почтением произнес Говорят его вовсе и нет в могиле Гроб был набит камнями И что он еще вернется когданибудьХайнс покачал головой Парнелл никогда не вернется  сказал он  Он там все то что было смертного в нем Мир праху егоМистер Блум шагал в одиночестве под деревьями меж опечаленных ангелов крестов обломанных колонн фамильных склепов каменных надежд молящихся с поднятыми горе взорами мимо старой Ирландии рук и сердец Разумнее тратить эти деньги на добрые дела для живых Молитесь за упокой души егоКак будто ктото на самом деле Спустили в яму и кончено Как уголь по желобу Потом для экономии времени за всех чохом День поминовенияДвадцать седьмого я буду у него на могиле Садовнику десять шиллинговВыпалывает сорняки Сам старик Сгорбленный в три погибели щелкает своими ножницами В могиле одной ногой Ушедший от нас Покинувший этот мир Как будто они по своей воле Всех выкинули пинком Сыгравший в ящикИнтересней если б писали кто они были Имярек колесник Я был коммивояжер сбывал коркский линолеум Я выплачивал по пять шиллингов за фунт Или женщина с кастрюлей Я стряпала добрую ирландскую похлебку Как там это стихотворение эклогия на сельском кладбище написал то ли Вордсворт то ли Томас Кемпбелл У протестантов говорят обрел вечный покой Или старый доктор Моррен великая

свадьбах никогда не берут в веночек Проржавелые венки гирлянды из фольги висели на крестах и оградках Вот это выгодней Хотя цветы более поэтично А такое надоедает не вянет никогда Совершенно

усевшись на столе продолжал читать вслух Или обратим взор на извивы говорливого ручейка что журча и пенясь враждует с каменистыми препонами на своем пути к бурливым водам голубых владений Нептуна и

направился к двери кабинета Я на минуту мистер Кроуфорд  сказал он  Мне только позвонить насчет одного объявленияОн вошел А как с передовицей для вечернего выпуска  спросил профессор Макхью подойдя к

съежившегося мальчишку за шиворот а остальные врассыпную бросились наутек из вестибюля и вниз по лестнице Сквозняк с мягким шелестом подхватил листки и они описав голубые закорючки в воздухе приземлились под столом Я не виноват сэр Это тот длинный меня впихнул сэр Да вышвырни его и закрой ту дверь  сказал редактор  А то целый ураган поднялсяЛенехан нагибаясь и покряхтывая начал подбирать

БлумОн подошел к двери и взявшись уже за ручку немного помедлилДжДжОМоллой захлопнул тяжелую подшивку В пустом вестибюле эхом отдавались звуки губной гармошки и двух пронзительных голосов мальчишек

сказали что он там рядом у ДиллонаКакой то миг он смотрел на них в нерешительности Редактор который облокотился на каминную полку подперев голову рукой внезапно широким жестом простер руку вперед Гряди  возгласил он  Перед тобою весь мирДжДжОМоллой взял листки у Ленехана из рук и начал читать осторожными дуновениями отделяя их друг от друга не говоря ни слова Он устроит эту рекламу  сказал профессор глядя через очки в черной оправе поверх занавески  Полюбуйтесь как эти юные бездельники за ним увязались Где Покажите  закричал Ленехан подбегая к окнуУЛИЧНОЕ ШЕСТВИЕОба посмеялись глядя поверх занавески на мальчишек которые выплясывали гуськом за мистером Блумом а у последнего белыми зигзагами мотался под ветром шутовской змей с белыми бантиками по хвосту Поглядеть на свистопляску этих разбойников  объявил Ленехан  и тут же загнешься Ох пуп с потехи вспотел Подхватили как тот вышагивает своими плоскостопыми лапищами Мелкие бесенята Подметки на ходу режутВдруг с резвостью он принялся карикатурить мазурку через всю комнату мимо камина скольженьями устремляясь к ОМоллою который опустил листки в готовно протянутые его руки Что это здесь  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд словно очнувшись  А где остальные двое Кто  обернулся профессор  Они отправились в Овал малость выпитьТам Падди Хупер а с ним Джек Холл Приехали вчера вечером Пошли раз так  решил Майлс Кроуфорд  Где моя шляпаДергающейся походкой он прошел в кабинет отводя полы пиджака и звеня ключами в заднем кармане Потом ключи звякнули на весу потом об дерево когда он запирал свой стол А он явно уже хорош  сказал вполголоса профессор Макхью Кажется да  раздумчиво пробормотал ДжДжОМоллой вынимая свой портсигар  Но знаете то что кажется не всегда верно Кто самый богатый спичкамиТРУБКА МИРАОн предложил сигареты профессору взял сам одну Ленехан чиркнул проворно спичкой и дал им по очереди прикурить ДжДжОМоллой снова раскрыл портсигар и протянул ему Мерсибо  сказал Ленехан беря сигаретуРедактор вышел из кабинета в соломенной шляпе криво надвинутой на лобПродекламировал нараспев тыча сурово пальцем в профессора МакхьюДа мощь и слава завлекли тебяИмперия твое пленила сердцеПрофессор усмехнулся не разомкнув своих длинных губ Ну что Эх ты несчастная Римская Империя  сказал Майлс КроуфордОн взял сигарету из раскрытого портсигара Ленехан тут же гибким движением поднес ему прикурить и сказал Прошу помолчать Моя новейшая загадка    произнес негромко ДжДжОМоллой  Это звучит куда благородней чем британская или брикстонская Слова чемто напоминают про масло подливаемое в огоньМайлс Кроуфорд мощно выпустил в потолок первую струю дыма Это точно  сказал он  Мы и есть масло Вы и я  масло в огонь И шансов у нас еще меньше чем у снежного кома в адском пеклеВЕЛИЧИЕ ЧЬЕ ИМЯ  РИМ Одну минуту  сказал профессор Макхью подняв два спокойных когтя  Не следует поддаваться словам звучанию слов Мы думаем о Риме имперском императорском императивномОн сделал паузу и ораторски простер руки вылезающие из обтрепанных и грязных манжет Но какова была их цивилизация Бескрайна согласен но и бездушна  сточные канавы Евреи в пустыне или на вершине горы говорили Отрадно быть здесь Поставим жертвенник Иегове А римлянин как и англичанин следующий по его стопам приносил с собою на любой новый берег куда ступала его нога на наш берег она никогда не ступала одну лишь одержимость клоакой Стоя в своей тоге он озирался кругом и говорил Отрадно быть здесь Соорудим же ватерклозет  Каковой неукоснительно и сооружали  сказал Ленехан  Наши древние далекие предки как можно прочесть в первой главе книги Пития имели пристрастие к проточной воде Они были достойными детьми природы  тихо сказал ДжДжОМоллой  Но у нас есть и римское право И Понтий Пилат пророк его  откликнулся профессор Макхью А вы слышали

обмахивать лицо его шелестящими листочкамиПрофессор возвращаясь на место мимо подшивок тронул легонько рукою распущенные галстуки Стивена и мистера ОМэддена Берка Париж в прошлом и настоящем Вы выглядите как коммунары Как те парни что взорвали Бастилию  сказал ДжДжОМоллой с мягкой иронией  Или может это как раз вы с ним пристрелили генералгубернатора Финляндии Судя по виду вы бы вполне могли

подкрепляя слова энергичным жестом  Вот погодите Мы парализуем Европу как выражался Игнатий Галлахер когда он мытарствовал подрабатывал маркером на бильярде в отеле Кларенс Галлахер вот это был

Кроуфорд И Гамли бедняга тоже там так он мне сказал стережет булыжники для города Ночной сторожСтивен с удивлением обернулся Гамли  переспросил он  Да что вы Тот что друг моего отца Да бросьте вы

Ленехан  И даже очень Преподнес им все на тарелочке  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд  Всю эту дьявольскую историюКошмар от которого ты никогда не проснешься Я видел сам  с гордостью произнес редактор  Я сам был при этомДик Адаме золотое сердце добрейший из всех мерзавцев кого только Господь сподобил родиться в Корке  и яЛенехан отвесил поклон воображаемой фигуре и объявил Мадам а там Адам А роза упала на лапу Азора Всю историю  восклицал Майлс Кроуфорд  Старушка с Принсстрит оказалась первой И был там плач и скрежет зубов Все изза одного рекламного объявления Грегор Грэй сделал эскиз для него и сразу на этом пошел в гору А потом Падди Хупер обработал Тэй Пэя и тот взял его к себе в Стар Сейчас он у Блюменфельда Вот это пресса Вот это талантПайетт Вот кто им всем был папочкой Отец сенсационной

главному судье Дада  с живостью подхватил ДжДжОМоллой  Леди Дадли шла домой через парк хотела поглядеть как там прошлогодний циклон повалил деревья и решила купить открытку с видом Дублина А открыткато эта оказалась выпущенной в честь то ли Джо Брэди то ли Главного или Козьей Шкуры И продавали у самой резиденции вицекороля можете себе представить Теперешние годятся только в департамент мелкого вздора  продолжал свое Майлс Кроуфорд  Тьфу Что пресса что суд Где вы теперь найдете такого юриста как те прежние как Уайтсайд как Айзек Батт как среброустый ОХейган А Эх чушь собачья Тьфу Гроша ломаного не стоятОн смолк но нервная и презрительная гримаса еще продолжала змеиться на губах у негоЗахотела бы какаянибудь поцеловать эти губы Как знать А зачем тогда ты это писалСКЛАД И ЛАДГубы клубы Губы  это какимто образом клубы так что ли Или же клубы  это губы Чтото такое должно быть Клубы тубы любы зубы грубы Рифмы два человека одеты одинаково выглядят одинаково по двое парами

сигарету  вы сделали неверные выводы из моих слов В настоящий момент на меня не возложена защита третьей профессии  профессии но все же резвость ваших коркских ног слишком заносит вас Отчего нам не вспомнить Генри Граттана и Флуда или Демосфена или Эдмунда Берка Мы все знаем Игнатия Галлахера и его шефа из Чейплизода Хармсуорта издававшего желтые газетенки а также и его американского кузена из помойного листка в стиле Бауэри не говоря уж про Новости Падди Келли Приключения Пью и нашего недремлющего друга Скиберинского орла Зачем непременно вспоминать такого мастера адвокатских речей как Уайтсайд Довлеет дневи газета егоОТЗВУКИ ДАВНИХ ДНЕЙ Граттан и Флуд писали вот для этой самой газеты  выкрикнул редактор ему в лицо  Патриоты и добровольцы А теперь вы где Основана в мДоктор Льюкас А кого сейчас можно сравнить с Джоном Филпотом КаррэномТьфу Ну что ж  сказал ДжДжОМоллой  вот скажем королевский адвокат Буш Буш  повторил редактор  Что же согласен Буш я согласен У него в крови это есть Кендал Буш то есть я хочу сказать Сеймур Буш Он бы уже давно восседал в судьях  сказал профессор  если бы не Ну ладно не будемДжДжОМоллой повернулся к Стивену и тихо с расстановкой сказал Я думаю самая отточенная фраза какую я слышал в жизни вышла из уст Сеймура Буша Слушалось дело о братоубийстве то самое дело Чайлдса Буш защищал егоИ мне в ушную полость влил настойКстати как же он узнал это Ведь он умер во сне Или эту другую историю про зверя с двумя спинами И какова же она была  спросил профессор   Он говорил о принципе правосудия на основе доказательств согласно римскому праву  сказал ОМоллой  Он противопоставлял его более древнему Моисееву закону   и здесь напомнил про Моисея Микеланджело в Ватикане Мда Несколько тщательно подобранных слов  возвестил Ленехан  ТишинаПоследовала пауза ДжДжОМоллой извлек свой портсигарНапрасно замерли Какаянибудь ерундаВестник задумчиво вынул спички и закурил сигаруПозднее я часто думал оглядываясь назад на эти странные дни не это ли крохотное действие столь само по себе пустое это чирканье этой спички определило впоследствии всю судьбу двух наших существованийОТТОЧЕННАЯ ФРАЗАДжДжОМоллой продолжал оттеняя каждое слово Он сказал о нем это музыка застывшая в мраморе каменное изваяние рогатое и устрашающее божественное в человеческой форме это вечный символ мудрости и прозрения который достоин жить если только достойно жить чтолибо исполненное воображением или рукою скульптора во мраморе духовно преображенном и преображающем Волнистое движение его гибкой руки эхом сопровождало фразу Блестяще  тотчас отозвался Майлс Кроуфорд Божественное вдохновение  промолвил мистер ОМэдден Берк А вам понравилось  спросил ДжДжОМоллой у СтивенаСтивен плененный до глубины красотой языка и жеста лишь молча покраснел Он взял сигарету из раскрытого портсигара и ДжДжОМоллой протянул портсигар Майлсу Кроуфорду Ленехан как и прежде дал им прикурить а потом уцепил трофей говоря Премногус благодаримусВЫСОКОНРАВСТВЕННЫЙ ЧЕЛОВЕК Профессор Мэйдженнис мне говорил про вас  обратился ОМоллой к Стивену  Скажите по правде что вы думаете обо всей этой толпе герметистов поэтов опалового безмолвия с верховным мистом АЭ Все началось с этой дамы Блаватской Уж это была замысловатая штучка В одном интервью которое он дал какомуто янки АЭ рассказывал как вы однажды явились к нему чуть свет и стали допытываться о планах сознанияМэйдженнис считает что вы должно быть решили попросту разыграть АЭ Он человек высочайшей нравственности МэйдженнисГоворил обо мне Но что он сказал Что он сказал Что он сказал обо мне Нет не спрошу Спасибо  сказал профессор Макхью отклоняя от себя портсигар  Погодите минуту Позвольте я коечто скажу Прекраснейшим образцом ораторского искусства какой я слышал была речь Джона ФТэйлора на заседании университетского исторического общества Сначала говорил судья Фицгиббон теперешний глава апелляционного суда а обсуждали они нечто довольно новое по тем временам эссе где ратовалось за возрождение ирландского языкаОн обернулся к Майлсу Кроуфорду и сказал Вы ведь знаете Джеральда Фицгиббона так что можете себе представить стиль его речи По слухам он заседает с Тимом Хили  вставил ДжДжОМоллой  в административной комиссии колледжа Тринити Он заседает с милым крошкой в детском нагрудничке  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд  Валяйте дальше Ну и что Прошу заметить  продолжал профессор  что это была речь опытного оратора с безупречной дикцией исполненная учтивого высокомерия и изливающая не скажу чашу гнева но скорей горделивое презрение к новому движению Тогда это было новым движением Мы были слабы и стало быть ни на что не годныНа мгновение он сомкнул свои тонкие длинные губы но стремясь продолжать поднес широко отставленную руку к очкам и коснувшись черной оправы подрагивающими пальцами безымянным и большим слегка передвинул фокусИМПРОВИЗАЦИЯНарочито будничным тоном он обратился к ДжДжОМоллою А Тэйлор надо вам знать явился туда больной встал с постели И я не верю что он заранее приготовил речь потому что во всем зале не было ни единой стенографистки Лицо у него было смуглое исхудалое с лохматой бородой во все стороны На шее болтался какойто шарф а сам он выглядел едва ли не умирающим хотя таковым и не былВзгляд его тут же хотя и без торопливости двинулся от ДжДжОМоллоя к Стивену и тут же потом обратился книзу будто ища чтото За склоненною головой обнаружился ненакрахмаленный полотняный воротничок засаленный от редеющих волос Все так же ища он сказал Когда Фицгиббон закончил речь Джон ФТэйлор взял ответное слово И вот что он говорил вкратце и насколько могу припомнитьТвердым движением он поднял голову Глаза снова погрузились во вспоминание Неразумные моллюски плавали в толстых линзах туда и сюда ища выходаОн начал Господин председатель леди и джентльмены Велико было мое восхищение словами с которыми только что обратился к молодежи Ирландии мой ученый друг Мне чудилось будто я перенесся в страну очень отдаленную от нашей и в эпоху очень далекую от нынешней будто я нахожусь в Древнем Египте и слушаю речь некоего первосвященника той земли обращенную к юному Моисею Его слушатели все внимание застыли с сигаретами в пальцах и дым от них восходил тонкими побегами распускавшимися по мере его речи Пусть дым от алтарей Близятся благородные слова Посмотрим А если бы самому попробовать силы И чудилось мне будто я слышу как в голосе этого египетского первосвященника звучат надменность и горделивость И услышал я слова его и смысл их открылся мне ИЗ ОТЦОВ ЦЕРКВИОткрылось мне что только доброе может стать хуже если бы это было абсолютное добро или вовсе бы не было добром то оно не могло бы стать хуже А черт побери Это же из святого Августина Отчего вы евреи не хотите принять нашей культуры и нашей религии и нашего языка Вы  племя кочующих пастухов мы  могущественный народ У вас нет городов и нет богатств наши города словно людские муравейники и наши барки триремы и квадриремы груженные всевозможными товарами бороздят воды всего известного мира Вы едва вышли из первобытного состояния у нас есть литература священство многовековая история и государственные законы НилРебенок  мужчина  изваяниеНа берегу Нила прислужницы преклонили колена тростниковая люлька  муж искусный в битве  каменнорогий каменнобородый сердце каменное Вы поклоняетесь темному безвестному идолу в наших храмах таинственных и великолепных обитают Изида и Озирис Гор и Амон Ра Ваш удел  рабство страх унижения наш  громы и моря Израиль слаб и малочисленны сыны его Египет  несметное воинство и грозно его оружие Бродягами и поденщиками зоветесь вы от нашего имени содрогается мир Беззвучная голодная отрыжка ворвалась в его речь Повышением голоса он отважно поборол ее Но леди и джентльмены если бы юноша Моисей внял этой речи и принял бы этот взгляд на жизнь если бы он склонил свою голову склонил свою волю склонил дух свой пред этим надменным поучением то никогда бы не вывел он избранный народ из дома рабства и не последовал бы днем за столпом облачным Никогда бы не говорил он с Предвечным средь молний на вершине Синая и не сошел бы с нее сияя отсветами боговдохновения на лице неся в руках скрижали закона выбитые на языке изгоев Он смолк и оглядел их наслаждаясь молчаниемЗЛОВЕЩИЙ ЗНАК  ДЛЯ НЕГОДжДжОМоллой не без сожаленья заметил И все же он умер не ступив на землю обетованную Внезапная  в  тот  миг  хотя  и  от  продолжительной  болезни  нередко  задолго  сжижаемая  кончина  изрек Ленехан  И позади у него лежало великое будущееПослышалось как стадо босых ног ринулось через вестибюль и по лестнице вверх Вот что такое искусство речи  сказал профессор не встретив ничьего возраженияУнесено ветром Людские скопища в Моллахмасте и в Таре королевской На целые мили  ушные полости Громовые речи трибуна звучат  и развеиваются ветром Народ обретал убежище в его голосе Умершие звуки Акашахроника где все что происходило когданибудь гденибудь где угодно Обожайте его и восхваляйте  но с меня хватитУ меня есть деньги Джентльмены  произнес Стивен  Следующим пунктом повестки дня позвольте внести предложение о переносе заседания в другое место Вы меня изумляете Надеюсь это не пустая любезность на французский манер  спросил мистер ОМэдден Берк  Ибо мыслю сие есть время когда винный кувшин выражаясь метафорически особливо приятствен в древней вашей гостинице Быть по сему и настоящим решительно решено Все кто за говори в глаза  возгласил Ленехан  Прочим молчок Объявляю предложение принятым В какое же именно питейное заведение Подаю свой голос за МуниОн возглавил шествие поучая Мы резко отвергнем возлияния крепких напитков разве не так Так да не так Ни под каким видомМистер ОМэдден Берк шедший за ним вплотную произнес делая соратнический выпад зонтом Рази Макдуф Весь в папашу  воскликнул редактор хлопнув Стивена по плечу  Двинулись Где эти чертовы ключиОн порылся в кармане и вытащил смятые листки Ящур Помню Все будет в порядке Пойдет Где же они Все в порядкеОн снова сунул листки в карман и ушел в кабинетБУДЕМ НАДЕЯТЬСЯДжДжОМоллой собравшись последовать за ним тихо сказал Стивену Надеюсь вы доживете пока это напечатают Майлс одну минуткуОн прошел в кабинет затворив дверь за собой Пойдемте Стивен  позвал профессор  Это было блестяще не правда ли

с ним в ногу  Кроуфорд нас догонитЕще один мальчишка пронесся мимо них вопя на бегу Специальный выпуск скачкиДОБРЫЙ ДРЯХЛЫЙ ДУБЛИНДублинцы Две дублинские весталки  начал Стивен  престарелые и набожные прожили пятьдесят и пятьдесят три года на Фамболлилейн Это где такое  спросил профессор Неподалеку от БлэкпиттсаСырая ночь с голодными запахами пекарни У стены Пухлое лицо поблескивает под дешевою шалью Неистовые сердца Акашахроника Поживей милокВперед Попробуй рискни Да будет жизнь Они желают посмотреть панораму Дублина с вершины колонны Нельсона У них накоплено три шиллинга десять пенсов в красной жестяной копилке в виде почтового ящика Они вытряхивают оттуда трехпенсовые монетки и шестипенсовики а пенсы выуживают помогая себе лезвием ножа Два шиллинга три пенса серебром один шиллинг семь пенсов медью Они надевают шляпки и воскресные платья берут с собой зонтики на случай дождя Мудрые девы  сказал профессор МакхьюЖИЗНЬ БЕЗ ПРИКРАС Они покупают на шиллинг четыре пенса грудинки и четыре ломтя формового хлеба у мисс Кейт Коллинз хозяйки Северных Столовых на Мальборострит Потом они покупают двадцать и четыре спелые сливы у девчонки торгующей у самого подножия колонны Нельсона чтобы утолять жажду после грудинки И заплатив две трехпенсовые монетки джентльмену у турникета они медленно начинают взбираться по винтовой лестнице кряхтя подбадривая друг друга пугаясь темных мест борясь с одышкой переспрашивая одна другую а грудинка у вас вознося хвалы Господу и Пречистой Деве грозясь повернуть назад и выглядывая в смотровые щелиУ уфф слава Богу Мы и понятия не имели что это так высокоЗовут их Энн Карнс и Флоренс Маккейб Энн Карнс страдает радикулитом и растирается от него лурдской водой которую ей дала одна леди а та получила бутылочку от одного монахапассиониста У Флоренс Маккейб каждую субботу на ужин свиные ножки и бутылка двойного пива Антитезис  молвил профессор кивая дважды  Девывесталки Так и вижу их Но что же наш друг там мешкаетОн обернулсяСтая стремглав летящих мальчишек неслась вниз по ступеням разлетаясь во все стороны вопя размахивая белыми листами газет За ними на лестнице появился Майлс Кроуфорд в нимбе шляпы вокруг малиновой физиономии продолжая беседовать с ДжДжОМоллоем Нагоняйте  крикнул ему профессор и помахал рукойЗатем он снова зашагал рядом со СтивеномВОЗВРАЩЕНИЕ БЛУМА Дада  сказал он  я их вижуМистер Блум весь запыхавшийся попавший в оголтелый водоворот мальчишекгазетчиков возле редакций Айриш католик и Дублин пенни джорнэл воззвал Мистер Кроуфорд Минуточку Телеграф Специальный выпуск скачки Ну в чем дело  спросил Майлс Кроуфорд замедляя шагВыкрик газетчика раздался перед самым носом мистера Блума Ужасная трагедия в Рэтмайнсе Ребенка защемило тискамиИНТЕРВЬЮ С РЕДАКТОРОМ Все об этой рекламе  начал мистер Блум проталкиваясь к ступеням отдуваясь и вынимая вырезку из кармана  Я только что говорил с мистером Ключчи Он сказал что закажет на два месяца А там посмотрит Но он еще хочет заметку в Телеграфе в субботнем розовом чтобы привлечь вниманиеЯ уже говорил советнику Наннетти он хочет такую же как была в Килкенни пипл если еще не слишком поздно Я бы мог ее взять в Национальной Библиотеке Понимаете дом ключей Его фамилия Ключчи получается игра слов Но он можно считать обещал что закажет Но он только хочет чтобы это немножко раздуть Что мне ему передать мистер КроуфордПМЖ Передайте что он может поцеловать меня в жопу  отрезал Майлс Кроуфорд сделав выразительный жест  Вот так в натуре и передайтеСлегка нервничает Надо поосторожней Все двинулись выпить Рука об руку Морская фуражка Ленехана поспешает на дармовщинку Как всегда подольстился Интересно кто всех подбил молодой Дедал что ли Сегодня на нем вполне приличные башмаки В последний раз как я его видел у него пятки высвечивали И гдето вляпался в грязь Беззаботный малый Что же он делал в Айриштауне Что же  сказал мистер Блум снова переводя взгляд на редактора  Если я достану эскиз стоит помоему поместить маленькую заметку Думаю он даст это объявление Я ему передамПМБИЖ Он может поцеловать мою благородную ирландскую жопу  громогласно объявил Майлс Кроуфорд  Совершенно в любое время так вот и передайтеИ покуда мистер Блум стоял взвешивая положение и нерешительно улыбаясь он двинулся дальше своей подергивающейся походкойВ ПОИСКАХ ССУДЫ   Джек  сказал он поднося руку к подбородку  Я и сам вот посюда Тоже крупные передряги Не далее как на прошлой неделе разыскивал кто бы дал поручительство под мой вексель Мне очень жаль Джек Будь хоть малейшая возможность Если бы мог гденибудь найти я бы со всей душойДжДжОМоллой кисло поморщился и молча зашагал дальше Они нагнали остальных и пошли рядом с ними И когда они съели свою грудинку и хлеб и вытерли все двадцать пальцев о бумагу от хлеба тогда они подошли поближе к перилам Тут коечто для вас  пояснил профессор Майлсу Кроуфорду  Две дублинские старушки на вершине колонны НельсонаНУ И КОЛОННА  ВОТ ЧТО СКАЗАЛА ПЕРВАЯ ИЗ ВЗОБРАВШИХСЯ Это свежо  одобрил Майлс Кроуфорд  Это материал Выбрались на гулянье сапожников в Дагл Две старые плутовки а дальше что Но они боятся что колонна упадет  продолжал Стивен  Они глядят на крыши и спорят о том где какая церковь голубой купол в Рэтмайнсе Адама и Евы святого Лаврентия ОТула Но когда смотрят у них начинает кружиться голова так что они задирают платьяЛЕГКАЯ НЕОБУЗДАННОСТЬ ЭТИХ ЖЕНЩИН Полегче  сказал Майлс Кроуфорд  Без поэтических вольностей Мы тут в епархии архиепископа И усаживаются на свои полосатые исподние юбки взирая вверх на статую однорукого прелюбодея Однорукий прелюбодей  воскликнул профессор  Мне это нравится Я уловил мысль Я вижу что вы хотите сказатьМОЖНО ПОДУМАТЬ ДАМЫ ОДАРИВАЮТ ГРАЖДАН ДУБЛИНА СКОРОСТНЫМИ ПИЛЮЛЯМИ И БЫСТРОЛЕТНЫМИ МЕТЕОРИТАМИ Но у них от этого затекает шея  говорил Стивен  и они так устали что уже не могут смотреть ни вверх ни вниз ни даже говорить Они ставят между собой пакет со сливами и начинают их поедать одну за другой утирая платочками сливовый сок стекающий изо рта и не спеша выплевывая косточки через перилаВ конце у него вдруг вырвался громкий молодой смех Услышав его Ленехан и мистер ОМэдден Берк обернулись и помахав

залив небо Ни звука Небо У Львиной Головы цвет моря темнолиловыйЗеленый у Драмлека Желтозеленый к Саттону Подводные заросли в траве слегка виднеются темные линии затонувшие города Ее волосы лежали как на подушке на моем пальто я подложил руку ей под затылок жучки в вереске щекотали руку ах ты все на мне изомнешь Какое чудо Ее душистая нежнопрохладная рука касалась меня ласкала глаза на меня смотрели не отрываясь В восторге я склонился над ней ее полные губы раскрылись я целовал их Умм Мягким движением она подсунула ко мне в рот печенье с тмином которое она жевала Теплая противная масса которую пережевывал ее рот кислосладкая от ее слюны Радость я глотал ее радость Юная жизнь выпятив губки она прильнула ими к моим Губы нежные теплые клейкие как душистый лукум Глаза ее были как цветы глаза полные желания возьми меня Невдалеке посыпались камешки Она не пошевелилась Коза Больше никого Высоко в рододендронах Бен Хоута разгуливала как дома коза роняя свои орешки Скрытая папоротниками она смеялась в горячих объятиях Лежа на ней я целовал ее неистово и безумно ее глаза губы ее открытую шею где билась жилка полные женские груди под тонкой шерстяной блузкой твердые соски глядящие вверх Целуя я касался ее своим горячим языкомОна целовала меня Я получал поцелуи Уже вся поддаваясь она ерошила мои волосы Осыпаемая моими поцелуями целовала меняМеня И вот я теперьБились жужжали

голову посмотреть Посмотрю сегодня Хранитель не заметитЧто нибудь выроню и нагнусь Погляжу есть ли у нееИз его мочевого пузыря просочился неслышный сигнал пойти сделать не делать там сделать Как мужчина в готовности он осушил свой стакан до дна и вышел они отдаются и смертным влекутся к мужскому ложатся с любовникамимужчинами юноша наслаждался с нею во дворКогда затих звук его шагов Дэви Берн от своей книги спросил А что он такое Он не в страховом бизнесе Это дело он давно бросил  отозвался Флинн Длинный Нос  Сейчас он рекламный агент во Фримене На видто я его хорошо знаю  сказал Дэви Берн  У него что несчастье Несчастье  удивился флинн Длинный Нос  В первый раз слышу А почему Я заметил он в трауре Разве  спросил Флинн Длинный Нос  А ведь верно ейей Я у него спросил как дела дома Убей бог ваша правда В трауре Я никогда не завожу разговор об этом  сказал человеколюбиво Дэви Берн  если вижу что у джентльмена такое несчастье Им это только лишний раз напоминает Точно что это не жена  сказал флинн Длинный Нос  Я его встретил позавчера на Генристрит он как раз выходил из молочной Ирландская ферма где торгует жена Джона Уайза Нолана и нес в руках банку сливок для своей драгоценной половины Она отлично упитанна я вам доложу Пышногрудая птичка А он значит трудится во Фримене  сказал Дэви БернФлинн Длинный Нос значительно поджал губы С рекламок что он добывает на сливки не заработаешь Можете всем ручаться Это как же так  спросил Дэви Берн оставив свою книжку и подходя ближеФлинн Длинный Нос проделал пальцами в воздухе несколько быстрых пассов фокусника И подмигнул глазом Он принадлежит к ложе  промолвил он Это вы что серьезно  спросил Дэви Берн Серьезней некуда  сказал Длинный Нос  К древнему свободному и признанному братству Свет жизнь и любовь во как И они его всячески поддерживают Мне это сказал один ээ не важно кто Но это факт У да это отличное братство  сказал Длинный Нос  Они вас никогда не оставят в беде Я знаю одного парня который к ним пытался попасть но только к ним попробуйка попади Скажем женщин они вообще не допускают и правильно делают ейбогуДэви Берн единым разом улыбнулсязевнулкивнул Иииааааааахх Както одна женщина  продолжал Длинный Нос  спряталась в часы подсмотреть чем они занимаются Но будь я проклят они както ее учуяли и тут же на месте заставили дать присягу Мастеру ложи Она была из рода СентЛеже ДонерайльДэви Берн еще со слезами на глазах после сладкого зевка сказал недоверчиво Но всетаки факт ли это Он такой скромный приличный Я его часто тут вижу и ни одного разу не было чтобы он  ну знаете чтото себе позволил Сам Всемогущий его не заставит напиться  энергично подтвердил Длинный Нос  Как чует уже покрупному загудели тут же смывается Не заметили как он посмотрел на часы Хотя да вас не было Его позовешь выпить так он первое что сделает это вытащит свои часы и по времени решит чего ему надо принять внутрь Всегда так делает вот те крест Бывают некоторые такие  сказал Дэви Берн  Но он человек надежный вот что я вам скажу Мужик неплохой  опять согласился Длинный Нос шмыгнув носом  Про него знают что он и кошельком поможет при случае Каждому надо по заслугам Без спору есть у Блума хорошее Но вот одну штуку он ни за что не сделаетЕго рука изобразила как бы росчерк пера подле стакана с грогом Я знаю  сказал Дэви Берн Черным по белому  ни за что  сказал Длинный НосВошли Падди Леонард и Бэнтам Лайонс Следом появился Том Рочфорд поглаживая по бордовому жилету ладонью Почтение мистер Берн Почтение джентльмены Они остановились у стойки Кто ставит  спросил Падди Леонард Как кто не знаю а я на мели  ответил Флинн Длинный Нос Ладно чего берем  спросил Падди Леонард Я возьму имбирный напиток  сказал Бэнтам Лайонс Чегочего  воскликнул Падди Леонард  Это с каких же пор мать честная А ты Том Как там канализация работает  спросил Флинн Длинный Нос прихлебываяВместо ответа Том Рочфорд прижал руку к груди и громко икнул Вас не затруднит дать стаканчик воды мистер Берн  попросил он Сию минуту сэрПадди Леонард оглядел своих собутыльников Ну и дела пошли  сказал он  Вы только полюбуйтесь чему я выпивку ставлю Вода и имбирная шипучка И это парни которые слизали б виски с волдыря на ноге Вот у этого за пазухой какаято чертова лошадка на Золотой кубок Удар без промаха Мускат что ли  спросил Флинн Длинный НосТом Рочфорд высыпал в свой стакан какойто порошок из бумажки Проклятый желудок  сказал он перед тем как выпить Сода хорошо помогает  посоветовал Дэви БернТом Рочфорд кивнул и выпил Так что Мускат Я молчу  подмигнул Бэнтам Лайонс  Сам на это дело пускаю кровные пять шиллингов Да скажи нам если ты человек и черт с тобой  сказал Падди Леонард  Самто ты от кого узналМистер Блум направляясь к выходу поднял приветственно три пальца До скорого  сказал Флинн Длинный НосОстальные обернулись Вот это он самый от кого я узнал  прошептал Бэнтам Лайонс Тьфу  произнес с презрением Падди Леонард  Мистер Берн сэр так значит вы дайте нам два маленьких виски Джеймсон и И имбирный напиток  любезно закончил Дэви Берн Вотвот  сказал Падди Леонард  Бутылочку с соской для младенцаМистер Блум шагал в сторону Доусонстрит тщательно прочищая языком зубы Верно чтото зеленое вроде шпината С помощью рентгеновских лучей можно быНа Дьюк лейн прожорливый терьер вырыгнул на булыжники тошнотворную жвачку из косточек и хрящей и с новым жаром набросился на нееНеумеренность в пище С благодарностью возвращаем полностью переварив содержимое Сначала десерт потом оно же закуска Мистер Блум предусмотрительно обошел Жвачные животные Это ему на второе Они двигают верхней челюстью Интересно сумеет ли Том Рочфорд чтонибудь провернуть с этим своим изобретением Зря трудится втолковывая этому Флинну ему бы только в глотку залить У тощего мужика глотка велика Должны устроить специальный зал или другое место где изобретатели могли б на свободе изобретать Правда конечно туда бы все чокнутые сбежалисьОн стал напевать удлиняя торжественным эхом последние ноты каждого такта

пальцев Мастер на все руки ищет работу За скромное вознаграждение Неприхотлив в едеМистер Блум повернул за угол у витрины кондитерской Кэтрин Грэй с нераскупленными тортами и миновал книжный магазин преподобного Томаса Коннеллана Почему я порвал с католической церковью Птичье гнездышкоЖенщины там заправляют всем Говорят во время неурожая на картошку они подкармливали супом детей бедняков чтобы переходили в протестанты А подальше там общество куда папа ходил по обращению в христианство бедных евреев Одна и та же приманка Почему мы порвали с католической церковьюСлепой юноша стоял у края тротуара постукивая по нему тонкой палкойТрамвая не видно Хочет перейти улицу Вы хотите перейти  спросил мистер БлумСлепой не ответил Его неподвижное лицо слабо дрогнуло Он неуверенно повернул голову Вы на Доусонстрит  сказал мистер Блум  Перед вами Моулсвортстрит Вы хотите перейти Сейчас путь свободенПалка подрагивая подалась влево Мистер Блум поглядел туда и снова увидел фургон красильни стоящий у Парижской парикмахерской Дрейго Где я и увидел его напомаженную шевелюру как раз когда я Понурая лошадь Возчик  у Джона Лонга Промочить горло Там фургон  сказал мистер Блум  но он стоит на месте Я вас провожу через улицу Вам нужно на Моулсвортстрит Да  ответил юноша  На Южную Фредерикстрит Пойдемте  сказал мистер БлумОн осторожно коснулся острого локтя  затем взял мягкую ясновидящую руку повел впередСказать ему чтонибудь Только не разыгрывать сочувствие Они не верят словам Чтонибудь самое обыкновенное Дождь прошел сторонойНикакого ответаПиджак его в пятнах Наверно не умеет как следует есть Все вкусы он чувствует подругому Кормить приходилось сначала с ложечки Ручка как у ребенка Как раньше у Милли Чуткая Я думаю он может представить мои размеры по моей руке А интересно имя у него есть Фургон Палка чтоб не задела лошади за ноги скотинка притомилась пусть дремлет Так Все как надо Быка обходи сзади  лошадь спереди Спасибо сэрЗнает что я мужчина По голосу Все в порядке Теперь первый поворот налевоСлепой нащупал палкой край тротуара и продолжал путь занося палку и постукивая ею перед собойМистер Блум следовал позади за незрячими стопами и мешковатым твидовым костюмом в елочку Бедный мальчик Но каким же чудом он знал что там этот фургон Стало быть както чувствовал Может у них какоето зрение во лбу как бы некоторое чувство объема Веса А интересно почувствует он если чтонибудь убрать Чувство пустоты Какое у него должно быть странное представление о Дублине из этого постукивания по камням А смог бы он идти по прямой если без палки Смиренное и бескровное лицо как у того кто готовится стать священникомПенроуз Вот как фамилия того парняСмотри сколько разных вещей они могут делать Читать пальцами Настраивать рояли А мы удивляемся что у них есть какойто разум Любой калека или горбун нам сразу кажется умным едва он чтото скажет что мы бы сами могли Конечно другие чувства обостряются Могут вышивать Плести корзины Люди должны им помогать Положим я бы подарил Молли корзинку для рукоделья ко дню рождения А она терпеть не может шитья Еще рассердитсяТемные так их называютИ обоняние у них наверное сильней Запахи со всех сторон слитые вместе У каждой улицы свой запах У каждого человека тоже Затем весна лето запахи А вкусы Говорят вкус вина не почувствуешь с закрытыми глазами или когда простужен И если куришь в темноте говорят нет того удовольствияА скажем с женщинами Меньше стыда если не видишь Вон проходит девчонка задравши нос мимо Института Стюарта Глядитека на меня Вот она я при всех доспехах Должно быть это странно если не видишь ее В воображении у него есть какоето понятие о форме Голос разность температур когда он касается ее пальцами должен почти уже видеть очертания округлости К примеру он проводит рукой по ее волосамДопустим у нее черные Отлично Назовем это черным Потом он гладит ее белую кожу Наверно другое ощущение Ощущение белогоПочта Надо ответить Чистая волынка сегодня Послать ей перевод на два шиллинга или на полкроны Прими от меня маленький подарок Вот и писчебумажный магазин рядом Погоди Сначала подумаюЛегкими и очень медленными касаниями его пальцы осторожно пощупали волосы зачесанные назад над ушами Еще раз Как тонкиепретонкие соломинки Затем столь же легко касаясь он пощупал кожу у себя на правой щеке Тут тоже пушистые волоски Не совсем гладкая Самая гладкая на животе Вокруг никого Только тот поворачивает на Фредерикстрит Не иначе настраивать рояль в танцевальных классах Левенстона Может быть это я поправляю подтяжкиПроходя мимо трактира Дорена он быстро просунул руку между брюками и жилетом и оттопырив слегка рубашку пощупал вялые складки на своем животе Но я же знаю что он беловатый желтый Надо посмотреть что будет если в темнотеОн вытащил руку и оправил свою одеждуБедняга Еще совсем мальчик Это ужасно Действительно ужасно Какие у него могут быть сны у незрячего Для него жизнь сон Где же справедливость если ты родился таким Все эти женщины и дети что сгорели и потонули в НьюЙорке

заложили за воротник Истории о судах и выездных сессиях рассказы про синемундирную школу И отвесил я ему десять годиков Я думаю он бы только скривился от того вина что я пил Для них из фирменных погребов бутылки пыльные на каждой поставлен год У него есть свои понятия о том что такое справедливость в суде Старикан с добрыми побуждениями Полицейские сводки битком набиты делами это они натягивают себе проценты фабрикуют преступления из любых пустяков А он им все такие дела заворачивает обратно Гроза для ростовщиков Рувима Дж уж совсем смешал с грязью А что тому только по заслугам

Любовных песен Коннахта Хайда Мне не удалось привести его сюда послушать дискуссию Он тут же побежал к Гиллу покупать ихСпеши скорей мой скромный трудК надменной публике на судКак горький рок тебя постиг Английский немощный язык Дым наших торфяников ему одурманил голову  предположил Джон ЭглинтонМы англичане сознаем Кающийся вор Ушел А я курил его табачокМерцающий зеленый камень Смарагд заключенный в оправу морей Люди не знают как могут быть опасны любовные песни  оккультически предостерегла Расселова яйцевидная аура  Движения вызывающие мировые перевороты рождаются из грез и видений в душе какогонибудь крестьянина на склоне холма Для них земля не почва для обработки а живая матьРазреженный воздух академии и арены рождает грошовый роман кафешантанную песенку Франция рождает в лице Малларме изысканнейший цветок развращенности но вожделенная жизнь  такая какой живут феаки Гомера открывается только нищим духомПри этих словах мистер Супер обратил к Стивену свой миролюбивый взор Понимаете  сказал он  у Малларме есть чудные стихотворения в прозе Стивен Маккенна мне их читал в Париже Одно из них  о ГамлетеОн говорит         понимаете читая книгу о самом себе Он описывает как дают Гамлета во французском городке понимаете в провинции Там выпустили такую афишуЕго свободная рука изящно чертила в воздухе маленькие значки     Он повторил новонасупленному челу Джона Эглинтона    понимаете Это так похоже на французов совершенно в их духе   Беззаботный нищий  закончил СтивенДжон Эглинтон рассмеялся Да это подойдет пожалуй  согласился он  Превосходные люди нет сомнения но в некоторых вещах ужасающе близорукиТоржественнотупое нагроможденье убийств Роберт Грин назвал его палачом души  молвил Стивен  Недаром он был сын мясника который помахивал своим топором да поплевывал в ладоньДевять жизней заплачено за одну  за жизнь его отца Отче наш иже еси во чистилище Гамлеты в хаки стреляют без колебаний Кровавая бойня пятого акта  предвидение концлагеря воспетого СуинберномКрэнли я его бессловесный ординарец следящий за битвами издалекаВрагов заклятых матери и детиКоторых кроме нас никто б не пощадилУлыбка сакса или ржанье янки Сцилла и Харибда Он будет доказывать что Гамлет  это история о призраках  заметил Джон Эглинтон к сведению мистера Супера  Он как жирный парень в Пиквикском клубе хочет чтоб наша плоть застыла от ужасаО слушай слушай слушайМоя плоть внимает ему застыв внимаетЕсли только ты А что такое призрак  спросил Стивен с энергией и волненьем  Некто ставший неощутимым вследствие смерти или отсутствия или смены нравов Елизаветинский Лондон столь же далек от Стратфорда как развращенный Париж от целомудренного Дублина Кто же тот призрак из   возвращающийся в мир где его забыли Кто король ГамлетДжон Эглинтон задвигался щуплым туловищем откинулся назад оценивая Клюнуло Середина июня это же время дня  начал Стивен быстрым взглядом прося внимания  На крыше театра у реки поднят флаг Невдалеке в Парижском саду ревет в своей яме медведь Саккерсон Старые моряки что плавали еще с Дрэйком жуют колбаски среди публики на стоячих местахМестный колорит Вали все что знаешь Вызови эффект присутствия Шекспир вышел из дома гугенотов на Силверстрит Вот он проходит по берегу мимо лебединых садков Но он не задерживается чтобы покормить лебедку подгоняющую к тростникам свой выводок У лебедя Эйвона иные думыВоображение места Святой Игнатий Лойола спеши на помощь Представление начинается В полумраке возникает актер одетый в старую кольчугу с плеча придворного щеголя мужчина крепкого сложения с низким голосом Это  призрак это король король и не король а актер  это Шекспир который все годы своей жизни не отданные суете сует изучал Гамлета чтобы сыграть роль призрака Он обращается со словами роли к Бербеджу молодому актеру который стоит перед ним по ту сторону смертной завесы и называет его по имениГамлет я дух родного твоего отцаи требует себя выслушать Он обращается к сыну сыну души своей юному принцу Гамлету и к своему сыну по плоти Гамнету Шекспиру который умер в Стратфорде чтобы взявший имя его мог бы жить вечно И неужели возможно чтобы актер Шекспир призрак в силу отсутствия а в одеянии похороненного монарха Дании призрак и в силу смерти говоря свои собственные слова носителю имени собственного сына будь жив Гамнет Шекспир он был бы близнецом принца Гамлета  неужели это возможно я спрашиваю неужели вероятно чтобы он не сделал или не предвидел бы логических выводов из этих посылок ты обездоленный сын  я убитый отец  твоя мать преступная королева Энн Шекспир урожденная Хэтуэй Но это копанье в частной жизни великого человека  нетерпеливо вмешался РасселАга старик и ты Интересно лишь для приходского писаря У нас есть пьесы И когда перед нами поэзия Короля Лира  что нам до того как жил поэт Обыденная жизнь  ее наши слуги могли бы прожить за нас как заметил Вилье де ЛильВынюхивать закулисные сплетни поэт пил поэт был в долгах У нас есть Король Лир  и он бессмертенЛицо мистера Супера  адресат слов  выразило согласиеСтреми над ними струи вод тебе подвластныхМананаан Мананаан МакЛирА как любезный насчет того фунта что он одолжил тебе когда ты голодалО еще бы я так

вызов трехсотлетней традиции  язвительно вопросил Джон Эглинтон  Вот уж ее призрак никогда никого не тревожил Она скончалась  для литературы во всяком случае  прежде своего рождения Она скончалась  парировал Стивен  через шестьдесят семь лет после своего рождения Она видела его входящим в жизнь и покидающим ее Она была его первой возлюбленной Она родила ему детей И она закрыла ему глаза положив медяки на веки когда он покоился на смертном одреМать на смертном одре Свеча Занавешенное зеркало Та что дала мне жизнь лежит здесь с медяками на веках убранная дешевыми цветами  Я плакал одинДжон Эглинтон глядел на свернувшегося светлячка в своей лампе Принято считать что Шекспир совершил ошибку  произнес он  но потом поскорее ее исправил насколько мог Вздор  резко заявил Стивен  Гений не совершает ошибок Его блуждания намеренны они  врата открытияВрата открытия распахнулись чтобы впустить квакерабиблиотекаря скрипоногого плешивого ушастого деловитого Строптивицу  возразил строптиво Джон Эглинтон  с большим трудом представляешь вратами открытия Какое интересно открытие Сократ сделал благодаря Ксантиппе Диалектику  отвечал Стивен  а благодаря своей матери  искусство рожденья мыслей А чему научился он у своей другой жены Мирто   у Эпипсихидиона Сократидидиона того не узнает уж ни один мужчина тем паче женщина Однако ни мудрость повитухи ни сварливые поучения не спасли его от архонтов из Шинн Фейн и от их стопочки цикуты Но всетаки Энн Хэтуэй  прозвучал негромкий примирительный голос мистера Супера  Кажется мы забываем о ней как прежде сам ШекспирС задумчивой бороды на язвительный череп переходил его взгляд дабы напомнить дабы укорить без недоброты переместившись затем к тыкве лысорозовой лолларда подозреваемого безвинно У него было на добрую деньгу ума  сказал Стивен  и память далеко не дырявая Он нес свои воспоминания при себе когда поспешал в град столичный насвистывая Оставил я свою подружку Не будь даже время указано землетрясением мы бы должны были знать где это все было  бедный зайчонок дрожащий в своей норке под лай собак и уздечка пестрая и два голубых окна Эти воспоминания Венера и Адонис лежали в будуаре у каждой лондонской прелестницы Разве и вправду строптивая Катарина неказиста Гортензио называет ее юною и прекрасной Или вы думаете что автор Антония и Клеопатры страстный пилигрим вдруг настолько ослеп что выбрал разделять свое ложе самую мерзкую мегеру во всем УорикширеПризнаем он оставил ее чтобы покорить мир мужчин Но его героини которых играли юноши это героини юношей Их жизнь их мысли их речи  плоды мужского воображения Он неудачно выбрал Как мне кажется это его выбрали Бывал наш Вилл и с другими мил но только Энн взяла его в пленБожусь вина на ней Она опутала его на славу эта резвушка двадцати шести лет Сероглазая богиня что склоняется над юношей Адонисом нисходит чтобы покорить словно пролог счастливый к возвышенью это и есть бесстыжая бабенка из Стратфорда что валит в пшеницу своего любовника который моложе нееА мой черед КогдаПриди В рожь  уточнил мистер Супер светло и радостно поднимая новый блокнот свой радостно и светлоИ с белокурым удовольствием для всеобщего сведения напомнил негромкоВо ржи густой слила устаПрелестных поселян четаПарис угодник которому угодили на славуРослая фигура в лохматой домотканине поднялась из тени и извлекла свои кооперативные часы К сожалению мне пора в ХомстедКуда ж это он Почва для обработки Как вы уходите  вопросили подвижные брови Джона Эглинтона  А вечером мы увидимся у Мура Там появится Пайпер Пайпер  переспросил мистер Супер  Пайпер уже вернулсяПитер Пайпер с перепою пересыпал персики каперсами Не уверен что я смогу Четверг У нас собрание Если только получится уйти вовремяЙогобогомуть в меблирашках Доусона Изида без покрова Их священную книгу на пали мы

квинтэссенциальную ничтожностьВ темницу плоти ввергнута душа Говорят что нас ожидает литературный сюрприз  тоном дружеским и серьезным промолвил квакербиблиотекарь  Разнесся слух будто бы мистер Рассел подготовил сборник стихов наших молодых поэтов Мы ждем с большим интересомС большим интересом он глянул в сноп ламповых лучей где три лица высветились блестяСмотри и запоминайСтивен глянул вниз на безглавую шляпенцию болтающуюся на ручке тросточки у его колен Мой шлем и меч Слегка дотронуться указательными пальцами Опыт Аристотеля Одна или две Необходимость есть то в силу чего вещам становится невозможно быть подругому Значится одна шляпа она и есть одна шляпаВнимайЮный Колем и Старки Джордж Роберте взял на себя коммерческие хлопотыЛонгворт как следует раструбит об этом в Экспрессе О в самом деле Мне понравился Погонщик Колема Да у него пожалуй имеется эта диковина гениальность Так вы считаете в нем есть искра гениальности Йейтс восхищался его двустишием Так в черной глубине земли Порой блеснет античный мрамор В самом деле Я надеюсь вы все же появитесь сегодняМэйлахи Маллиган тоже придет Мур попросил его привести Хейнса Вы уже слышали остроту мисс Митчелл насчет Мура и Мартина О том что Мур  это грехи молодости Мартина Отлично найдено не правда ли Они вдвоем напоминают Дон Кихота и Санчо Пансу Как любит повторять доктор Сигерсон наш национальный эпос еще не создан Мур  тот человек который способен на это Наш дублинский рыцарь печального образа В шафранной юбке ОНил Рассел Ну как же он должен говорить на великом древнем наречии А его Дульсинея Джеймс Стивенс пишет весьма неглупые очерки Пожалуй мы приобретаем известный весКорделия  Самая одинокая из дочерей ЛираГлухомань А теперь покажи свой парижский лоск Покорнейше благодарю мистер Рассел  сказал Стивен вставая  Если вы будете столь любезны передать то письмо мистеру Норману О разумеется Он его поместит если сочтет важным Знаете у нас столько корреспонденции Я понимаю  отвечал Стивен  Благодарю васДай тебе Бог Свиная газетка Отменно быколюбива Синг тоже обещал мне статью для Даны Но будут ли нас читатьСдается мне что будут Гэльская лига хочет чтонибудь на ирландскомНадеюсь что вы придете вечером И прихватите СтаркиСтивен снова уселсяОтделясь от прощающихся подошел квакербиблиотекарь Краснея его личина произнесла Мистер Дедал ваши суждения поразительно проясняют всеС прискрипом переступая тудасюда сближался он на цыпочках с небом на высоту каблука и уходящими заглушаем спросил тихонько Значит по вашему мнению она была неверна поэтуВстревоженное лицо предо мной Почему он подошел Из вежливости или по внутреннему озарению Где было примирение  молвил Стивен  там прежде должен был быть разрыв Это верноЛис Христов в грубых кожаных штанах беглец от облавы скрывавшийся в трухлявых дуплах Не имеет подруги в одиночку уходит от погони Женщин нежный пол склонял он на свою сторону блудниц вавилонских судейских барынь жен грубияновкабатчиков Игра в гусей и лисицу А в НьюПлейс  обрюзглое опозоренное существо некогда столь миловидное столь нежное свежее как юное деревце а ныне листья его опали все до единого и страшится мрака могилы и нет прощения Это верно Значит вы полагаетеЗакрылась дверь за ушедшимПокой воцарился вдруг в укромной сводчатой келье покой и тепло располагающие к задумчивостиСветильник весталкиТут он раздумывает о несбывшемся о том как бы жил Цезарь если бы поверил прорицателю  о том что бы могло быть  о возможностях возможного как такового  о неведомых вещах  о том какое имя носил Ахилл когда он жил среди женщинВокруг меня мысли заключенные в гробах в саркофагах набальзамированные словесными благовониями Бог Тот покровитель библиотек увенчанный луной птицебог И услышал я глас египетского первосвященника Книг груды глиняных в чертогах расписных Они недвижны А некогда кипели в умах людей Недвижны но все еще пожирает их смертный зуд хныча нашептывать мне на ухо свои басни навязывать мне свою волю Бесспорно  философствовал Джон Эглинтон  из всех великих людей он самый загадочный Мы ничего не знаем о нем знаем лишь что он жил и страдал Верней даже этого не знаем Другие нам ответят на вопрос А все остальное покрыто мраком Но ведь Гамлет  там столько личного разве вы не находите  выступил мистер Супер  Я хочу сказать это же почти как дневник понимаете дневник его личной жизни Я хочу сказать меня вовсе не волнует кто там понимаете преступник или кого убилиОн положил девственно чистый блокнот на край стола улыбкою заключив свой выпад Его личный дневник в подлиннике          А ты это посыпь английской солью малютка ДжонИ глаголет малютка Джон Эглинтон После того что нам рассказывал Мэйлахи Маллиган я мог ожидать парадоксов Но должен предупредить если вы хотите разрушить мое убеждение что Шекспир это Гамлет перед вами тяжелая задачаПрошу немного терпенияСтивен выдержал тяжелый взгляд скептика ядовито посверкивающий изпод насупленных бровей Василиск      Мессир Брунетто благодарю тебя за подходящее слово Подобно тому как мы  или то матерь Дана  сказал Стивен  без конца ткем и распускаем телесную нашу ткань молекулы которой день и ночь снуют взадвперед  так и художник без конца ткет и распускает ткань собственного образа И подобно тому как родинка у меня на груди по сей день там же справа где и была при рождении хотя все тело уж много раз пересоткано из новой ткани  так в призраке неупокоившегося отца вновь оживает образ почившего сына В минуты высшего воодушевления когда по словам Шелли наш дух словно пламенеющий уголь сливаются воедино тот кем я был и тот кто я есмь и тот кем возможно мне предстоит быть Итак в будущем которое сестра прошлого я может быть снова увижу себя сидящим здесь как сейчас но только глазами того кем я буду тогдаСие покушение на высокий стиль  не без помощи Драммонда из Хоторндена Дада  раздался юный голос мистера Супера  Мне Гамлет кажется совсем юным Возможно что горечь в нем  от отца но уж сцены с Офелией  несомненно от сынаПальцем в небо Он в моем отце Я в его сыне Вот родинка которая исчезнет последней  отозвался Стивен со смехомДжон Эглинтон сделал пренедовольную мину Будь это знаком гения  сказал он  гении шли бы по дешевке в базарный день Поздние пьесы Шекспира которыми так восхищался Ренан проникнуты иным духом Духом примирения  шепнул проникновенно квакербиблиотекарь Не может быть примирения  сказал Стивен  если прежде него не было разрываУже говорил Если вы хотите узнать тени каких событий легли на жуткие времена Короля Лира Отелло Гамлета Троила и Крессиды  попробуйте разглядеть когда же и как тени эти рассеиваются Чем сердце смягчит человек Истерзанный в бурях мира Бывалый как сам Одиссей Перикл что был князем ТираГлава под красношапкой остроконечной заушанная слезоточивая Младенец девочка у него на руках Марина Тяга софистов к окольным тропам апокрифов  величина постоянная  сделал открытие Джон Эглинтон  Столбовые дороги скучны однако онито и ведут в городСтарина Бэкон уж весь заплесневел Шекспир  грехи молодости БэконаЖонглеры цифрами и шифрами шагают по столбовым дорогам Пытливые умы в великом поиске Какой же город почтенные мудрецы Обряжены в имена АЭ  эон Маги  Джон Эглинтон Восточнее солнца западнее луны    Парочка оба в сапогах с посохамиСколько миль до ДублинаТрижды пять и пятьДолго ли при свечке нам до него скакать По мнению господина Брандеса  заметил Стивен  это первая из пьес заключительного периода В самом деле А что говорит мистер Сидней Ли он же Симон Лазарь как некоторые уверяют Марина  продолжал Стивен  дитя бури Миранда  чудо Пердита  потерянная Что было потеряно вернулось к нему дитя его дочери Перикл говорит Моя милая жена была похожа на эту девочку Спрашивается как человек полюбит дочь если он не любил ее мать Искусство быть дедушкой  забормотал мистер Супер     Для человека у которого имеется эта диковина гениальность лишь его собственный образ служит мерилом всякого опыта духовного и практическогоСходство такого рода тронет его Но образы других мужей ему родственных по крови его оттолкнут Он в них увидит только нелепые потуги природы предвосхитить или скопировать его самогоБлагосклонное чело квакерабиблиотекаря осветилось розовою надеждой Я надеюсь мистер Дедал разовьет и дальше свою теорию на благо просвещения публики И мы непременно должны упомянуть еще одного комментатораирландца  Джорджа Бернарда Шоу Нельзя здесь не вспомнить и Фрэнка Харриса у него блестящие статьи о Шекспире в Сатердей ривьюЛюбопытно что и он также настаивает на этом неудачном романе со смуглой леди сонетов Счастливый соперник  Вильям Херберт граф Пембрук Но я убежден что если даже поэт и оказался отвергнутым это более гармонировало  как бы тут выразиться  с нашими представлениями о том чего не должно бытьДовольный он смолк вытянув кротко к ним плешивую голову  гагачье яйцо приз для победителя в спореСупружеская речь звучала бы у него суровым библейским слогом Любишь ли мужа сего Мириам Данного тебе от Господа Твоего И это не исключено  отозвался Стивен  У Гете есть одно изречение которое мистер Маги любит цитировать Остерегайся того к чему ты стремишься в юности ибо ты получишь это сполна в зрелые лета Почему он посылает к известной  к той бухте где все мужи бросали якорь к фрейлине со скандальною славой еще в девичестве какогото мелкого лордишку чтобы тот поухаживал вместо него Ведь он уже сам был лордом в словесности и успел стать отменным кавалером и написал Ромео и Джульетту Так почему же тогда Вера в себя была подорвана прежде времени Он начал с того что был повержен на пшеничном поле виноват на ржаном  и после этого он уже никогда не сможет чувствовать себя победителем и не узнает победы в бойкой игре в которой веселье и смех  путь к постели Напускное донжуанство его не спасет Его отделали так что не переделать Кабаний клык его поразил туда где кровью истекает любовь Пусть даже строптивая и укрощена ей всегда еще остается невидимое оружие женщины Я чувствую за его словами как плоть словно стрекалом толкает его к новой страсти еще темней первой затемняющей даже его понятия о самом себе Похожая судьба и ожидает его  и оба безумия совьются в единый вихрьОни внимают И я в ушные полости им лью Его душа еще прежде была смертельно поражена яд влит в ушную полость заснувшего Но те кого убили во сне не могут знать каким же способом они умерщвлены если только Творец не наделит этим знанием их души в будущей жизни Ни об отравлении ни о звере с двумя спинами что был причиной его не мог бы знать призрак короля Гамлета не будь он наделен этим знанием от Творца своего Вот почему его речь его английский немощный язык все время уходит кудато в сторону кудато назадНасильник и жертва то чего он хотел бы но не хотел бы следуют неотлучно за ним от полушарий Лукреции цвета слоновой кости с синими жилками к обнаженной груди Имогены где родинка как пять пурпурных точекОн возвращается обратно уставший от всех творений которые он нагромоздил чтобы спрятаться от себя самого старый пес зализывающий старую рану Но его утраты  для него прибыль личность его не оскудевает и он движется к вечности не почерпнув ничего из той мудрости которую сам создал и тех законов которые сам открыл Его забрало поднято Он призрак он тень сейчас ветер в утесах Эльсинора или что угодно зов моря слышный лишь в сердце того кто сущность его тени сын единосущный отцу Аминь  раздался ответный возглас от дверейНашел ты меня враг мойАнтракт Охальная физиономия с постной миной соборного настоятеля Бык Маллиган в пестром шутовском наряде продвигался вперед навстречу приветственным улыбкам Моя телеграмма Если не ошибаюсь ты тут разглагольствуешь о газообразном позвоночном  осведомился он у СтивенаЛимонножилетный он бодро слал всем приветствия размахивая панамой словно шутовским жезломОни оказывают ему теплый прием       Орава зубоскалов Фотий псевдомалахия Иоганн МостТот Кто зачал Сам Себя при посредничестве Святого Духа и Сам послал Себя Искупителем между Собой и другими Кто взят был врагами Своими на поругание и обнаженным бичеван и пригвожден аки нетопырь к амбарной двери и умер от голода на кресте Кто дал предать Его погребению и восстал из гроба и отомкнул ад и вознесся на небеса где и восседает вот уже девятнадцать веков одесную Самого Себя но еще воротится в последний день судити живых и мертвых когда все живые будут уже мертвы    Он воздевает руки Завесы падают О цветы Колокола колокола сплошной гул колоколов Да именно так  отвечал квакербиблиотекарь  Очень Ценная и поучительная беседа Я уверен что у мистера Маллигана тоже имеется своя теория по поводу пьесы и по поводу Шекспира Надо учитывать все стороны жизниОн улыбнулся обращая свою улыбку поровну во все стороныБык Маллиган с интересом задумался Шекспир  переспросил он  Мне кажется я гдето слыхал это имяБыстрая улыбка солнечным лучиком скользнула по его рыхлым чертам Ну да  радостно произнес он припомнив  Это ж тот малый что валяет под СингаМистер Супер обернулся к нему Вас искал Хейнс  сказал он  Вы не видали его Он собирался потом с вами встретиться в ДХК А сейчас он направился к Гиллу покупать Любовные песни Коннахта Хайда Я шел через музей  ответил Бык Маллиган  А он тут был Соотечественникам великого барда  заметил Джон Эглинтон  наверняка уже надоели наши замечательные теории Как я слышал некая актриса в Дублине вчера играла Гамлета в четыреста восьмой раз Вайнинг утверждал будто бы принц был женщиной Интересно еще никто не догадался сделать из него ирландца Мне помнится судья Бартон занимается разысканиями на эту тему Он  я имею в виду его высочество а не его светлость  клянется святым Патриком Но замечательнее всего  этот рассказ Уайльда  сказал мистер Супер поднимая свой замечательный блокнот  Портрет ВХ где он доказывает что сонеты были написаны неким Вилли Хьюзом мужем в чьей власти все цвета Вы хотите сказать посвящены Вилли Хьюзу  переспросил квакербиблиотекарьИли Хилли Вьюзу Или самому себе Вильяму Художнику ВХ угадай кто я Дада конечно посвящены  признал мистер Супер охотно внося поправку в свою ученую глоссу  Понимаете тут конечно сплошные парадоксы Хьюз и  то есть он режет и  цвета но это для него настолько типично как он это все увязывает Тут понимаете самая суть Уайльда Воздушная легкостьЕго улыбчивый взгляд с воздушною легкостью скользнул по их лицамБелокурый эфеб Выхолощенная суть УайльдаДо чего же ты остроумен Пропустив пару стопочек на дукаты магистра ДизиСколько же я истратил Пустяк несколько шиллинговНа ватагу газетчиков Юмор трезвый и пьяныйОстроумие Ты отдал бы все пять видов ума не исключая его за горделивый юности наряд в котором он красуясь выступает Приметы утоленного желаньяИх будет еще мно Возьми ее для меня В брачную пору Юпитер охлади их любовную горячку Ага поворкуй с нейЕва Нагой пшеничнолонный грех Змей обвивает ее своими кольцами целует его поцелуй  укус Вы думаете это всего только парадокс  вопрошал квакербиблиотекарь  Бывает что насмешника не принимают всерьез как раз когда он вполне серьезенОни с полной серьезностью обсуждали серьезность насмешникаБык Маллиган с застывшим выражением лица вдруг тяжко уставился на Стивена Потом мотая головой подошел вплотную вытащил из кармана сложенную телеграмму Проворные губы принялись читать вновь озаряясь восторженною улыбкой Телеграмма  воскликнул он  Дивное вдохновение ТелеграммаПапская буллаОн уселся на краешек одного из столов без лампы и громко весело прочитал Сентиментальным нужно назвать того кто способен наслаждаться не обременяя себя долгом ответственности за содеянное  Подпись ДедалОткуда ж ты это отбил Из бардака Да нет Колледж Грин Четыре золотых уже пропил Тетушка грозится поговорить с твоим убогосущным отцомТелеграмма Мэйлахи Маллигану Корабль Нижняя Эббистрит О бесподобный комедиант В попы подавшийся клинкианецОн бодро сунул телеграмму вместе с конвертом в карман и зачастил вдруг простонародным говорком Вот я те и толкую мил человек сидим это мы там я да Хейнс преем да нюним а тут те вдобавок эту несут И этакая нас разбирает тоска по адскому пойлу что вот те крест тут и монаха бы проняло самого даже хилого на эти дела А мы как бараны торчим у Коннери  час торчим потом два часа потом три да все ждем когда ж нам достанется хотя бы по пинте на душуОн причитал И вот торчим мы там мой сердешный а ты в ус не дуешь да еще рассылаешь такие бумаженции что у нас языки отвисли наружу на целый локоть как у святых отцов с пересохшей глоткой кому без рюмашки хуже кондрашкиСтивен расхохоталсяБык Маллиган быстро наклонился к нему с предостерегающим жестом Этот бродяга Синг тебя всюду ищет чтобы убить  сообщил он  Ему рассказали что это ты обоссал его дверь в Гластуле И вот он рыскает везде в поршнях хочет тебя убить Меня  возопил Стивен  Это был твой вклад в литературуБык Маллиган откинулся назад донельзя довольный и смех его вознесся к темному чутко внимавшему потолку Ейей прикончит  заливался онГрубое лицо напоминающее старинных чудищ на меня ополчалось когда сиживали за месивом из требухи на улице СентАндредезар Слова из слов ради слов  Ойсин с Патриком Как он повстречал фавна в Кламарском лесу размахивающего бутылкой вина    Мордует ирландский языкБлуждая повстречал он образ свой А я  свой Сейчас в лесу шута я встретил Мистер Листер  позвал помощник приоткрыв дверь где всякий может отыскать то что ему по вкусу Так судья Мэдден в своих Записках магистра Вильяма Сайленса отыскал у него охотничью терминологию Дада в чем дело Там пришел один джентльмен сэр  сказал помощник подходя ближе и протягивая визитную карточку  Он из Фримена и хотел бы просмотреть подшивку Килкенни пипл за прошлый год Пожалуйстапожалуйстапожалуйста А что этот джентльменОн взял деловитую карточку глянул не рассмотрел отложил не взглянув посмотрел снова спросил скрипнул спросил А он А вон тамСтремительно в гальярде он двинулся прочь наружу В коридоре при свете дня заговорил он велеречиво исполнен усердия и доброжелательства с сознанием долга услужливейший добрейший честнейший из всех сущих квакеров Вот этот джентльмен Фрименс джорнэл Килкенни пиплВсенепременно Добрый день сэр Килкенни Ну конечно имеетсяТерпеливый силуэт слушал и ждал Все ведущие провинциальные Нозерн виг Корк икземинер Эннискорти гардиан За тысяча девятьсот третий Желаете

силуэт поспешал за его скорым шагомДверь затворилась Это тот пархатый  воскликнул Бык МаллиганРезво вскочив он подобрал карточку Как там его Ицка Мойше БлумИ тут же затараторил Иегова сборщик крайней плоти больше не существует Я этого встретил в музее когда зашел туда поклониться пеннорожденной Афродите Греческие уста что никогда не изогнулись в молитве Мы каждый день должны ей воздавать честь О жизни жизнь твои уста воспламеняютНеожиданно он обернулся к Стивену Он знает тебя И знает твоего старикана Ого я опасаюсь что он погречистей самих греков Глаза его бледного галилеянина были так и прикованы к ее нижней ложбинке Венера Каллипига О гром сих чресл фавн преследует дев те же укрыться спешат Мы бы хотели послушать дальше  решил Джон Эглинтон с одобрения мистера Супера  Нас заинтересовала миссис Ш Раньше мы о ней думали если когданибудь приходилось как об этакой верной Гризельде о Пенелопе у очага Антисфен ученик Горгия  начал Стивен  отнял пальму первенства в красоте у племенной матки Кюриоса Менелая аргивянки Елены у этой троянской кобылы в которой квартировал целый полк героев  и передал ее скромной Пенелопе Он прожил в Лондоне двадцать лет и были времена когда он получал жалованья не меньше чем лордканцлер Ирландии Жил он богатоЕго искусство которое Уитмен назвал искусством феодализма скорее уж было искусством пресыщения Паштеты зеленые кубки с хересом соусы на меду варенье из розовых лепестков марципаны голуби начиненные крыжовником засахаренные коренья Когда явились арестовать сэра Уолтера Рэли на нем был наряд в полмиллиона франков и в том числе корсет по последней модеРостовщица Элиза Тюдор роскошью своего белья могла бы поспорить с царицей Савской Двадцать лет он порхал между супружеским ложем с его чистыми радостями и блудодейною любовью с ее порочными наслаждениями Вы знаете эту историю Маннингема про то как одна мещаночка увидев Дика Бербеджа в Ричарде Третьем позвала его погреться к себе в постель а Шекспир подслушал и не делая много шума из ничего прямиком взял корову за рогаТут Бербедж является устраивает стук у врат а Шекспир и отвечает ему изпод одеял мужарогоносца Вильгельм Завоеватель царствует прежде Ричарда Третьего  И милая резвушка миссис Фиттон оседлай и воскликни О и его нежная птичка леди Пенелопа Рич и холеная светская дама годится актеру и девки с набережной пенни за разКур ляРен           Сливки высшего света И мамаша сэра Вильяма Дэвенанта из Оксфорда у которой для каждого самца чарка винцаБык Маллиган подняв глаза к небу молитвенно возгласил О блаженная Маргарита Мария Ксамцускок И дочь Генрихашестиженца и прочие подруги из ближних поместий коих воспел благородный поэт ЛаунТеннисон Но как вы думаете что делала все эти двадцать лет бедная Пенелопа в Стратфорде за ромбиками оконных переплетовДействуй действуй Содеянное Вот он седеющий шатен прогуливается в розарии ботаника Джерарда на Феттерлейн Колокольчик что голубей ее жилок Фиалка нежнее ресниц Юноны Прогуливается Всего одна жизнь нам дана Одно тело Действуй Но только действуй Невдалеке  грязь пахучий дух похоти руки лапают белизнуБык Маллиган с силою хлопнул по столу Джона Эглинтона Так вы на кого думаете  спросил он с нажимом Допустим он  брошенный любовник в сонетах Брошенный один раз потом другой Однако придворная вертихвостка его бросила ради лорда ради его бесценнаямоялюбовьЛюбовь которая назвать себя не смеет Вы хотите сказать  вставил Джон бурбон Эглинтон  что он как истый англичанин питал слабость к лордамУ старых стен мелькают молнией юркие ящерицы В Шарантоне я наблюдал за ними Похоже что так  отвечал Стивен  коль скоро он готов оказать и ему и всем другим и любому невспаханному одинокому лону ту святую услугу какую конюх оказывает жеребцу Быть может он совсем как Сократ имел не только строптивую жену но и матьповитуху Но тато строптивая вертихвостка не нарушала супружеского обета Две мысли терзают призрака нарушенный обет и тупоголовый мужлан ставший ее избранником брат покойного супруга У милой Энн я уверен была горячая кровь Соблазнившая один раз соблазнит и в другойСтивен резко повернулся на стуле Бремя доказательства не на мне на вас  произнес он нахмурив брови  Если вы отрицаете что в пятой сцене Гамлета он заклеймил ее бесчестьем  тогда объясните мне почему о ней нет ни единого упоминания за все тридцать четыре года с того дня когда она вышла за него и до того когда она его схоронила Всем этим женщинам довелось проводить в могилу своих мужчин Мэри  своего благоверного Джона Энн  бедного дорогого Вилли когда тот вернулся к ней умирать в ярости что ему первому Джоан  четырех братьев Джудит  мужа и всех сыновей Сьюзен  тоже мужа а дочка Сьюзен Элизабет если выразиться словами дедушки вышла за второго убравши первого на тот свет О да упоминание есть В те годы когда он вел широкую жизнь в королевском Лондоне ей чтобы заплатить долг пришлось занять сорок шиллингов у пастуха своего отцаТеперь объясните все это А заодно объясните и ту лебединую песнь в которой он представил ее потомкамОн обозрел их молчаниеНа это ЭглинтонТак вы о завещаньеЮристы кажется его уж разъяснилиЕй как обычно дали вдовью частьВсе по законамВ них он был знатокКак говорят нам судьиА Сатана в ответ емуНасмешникИ потому ни слова нет о нейВ наброске первом но зато там естьПодарки и для внучки и для дочекИ для сестры и для друзей старинныхИ в Стратфорде и в ЛондонеИ потому когда он все ж включилСдается мне отнюдь не добровольноКой что и ей то он ей завещалСвою притом не лучшуюКроватьЗавещалЕйкроватьВторосортВтороватьКровещалТпру В те времена у прелестных поселян бывало негусто движимого имущества  заметил Джон Эглинтон  как впрочем и ныне если верить нашим пьесам из сельской жизни Он был богатым землевладельцем  возразил Стивен  Он имел собственный герб земельные угодья в Стратфорде дом в Ирландском подворье Он был пайщиком в финансовых предприятиях занимался податными делами мог повлиять на проведение закона в парламенте И почему он не оставил ей лучшую свою кровать если он ей желал мирно прохрапеть остаток своих ночей Были наверное две кровати одна получше а другая  так второй сорт  подал тонкую догадку мистер Второсорт Супер        суперсострил Бык Маллиган и повлек улыбание У древних упоминаются знаменитые постели Сейчас попробую вспомнить  наморщил лоб Второсорт Эглинтон улыбаясь постельно У древних упоминается  перебил его Стивен  что Стагирит школьникшалопай и лысый мудрец язычников умирая в изгнании отпустил на волю и одарил своих рабов воздал почести предкам и завещал чтобы его схоронили подле останков его покойной жены Друзей же он просил позаботиться о своей давней любовнице вспомним тут новую Герпиллис Нелл Гвинн и позволить ей жить на его вилле А вы тоже считаете что он умер так  спросил мистер Супер слегка озабоченно  Я имею в виду Он умер упившись в стельку  закрыл вопрос Бык Маллиган  Кварта эля  королевское блюдо Нет вот я лучше расскажу вам что изрек Доуден А что  вопросил СуперэглинтонВильям Шекспир и Ко акционерное общество Общедоступный Вильям Об условиях справляться ЭДоуден Хайфилдхаус Бесподобно  вздохнул с восхищением Бык Маллиган  Я у него спросил что он думает насчет обвинения в педерастии взводимого на поэтаА он воздел кверху руки и отвечает Мы можем единственно лишь сказать что в те времена жизнь била ключом БесподобноИзвращенец Чувство прекрасного совлекает нас с путей праведных  сказал грустнопрекрасный Супер угловатому УглинтонуА непреклонный Джон отвечал сурово Смысл этих слов нам может разъяснить доктор Невозможно чтобы и волки были сыты и овцы целыТако глаголеши Неужели они будут оспаривать у нас у меня пальму первенства в красоте А также и чувство собственности  заметил Стивен  Шейлока он извлек из собственных необъятных карманов Сын ростовщика и торговца солодом он и сам был ростовщик и торговец зерном попридержавший десять мер зерна во время голодных бунтов Те самые личности разных исповеданий о которых говорит Четтл Фальстаф и которые засвидетельствовали его безупречность в делах  они все были без сомнения его должники Он подал в суд на одного из своих собратьевактеров за несколько мешков солода и взыскивал людского мяса фунт в проценты за всякую занятую деньгу А как бы еще конюх и помощник суфлера  смотри у Обри так быстро разбогател Что бы ни делалось он со всего имел свой навар В Шейлоке слышны отзвуки той травли евреев что разыгралась после того как Лопеса лекаря королевы повесили и четвертовали а его еврейское сердце кстати вырвали из груди пока пархатый еще дышал в Гамлете и Макбете  отзвуки восшествия на престол шотландского философуса любившего поджаривать ведьм В Бесплодных усилиях любви он потешается над гибелью Великой Армады Помпезные его хроники плывут на гребне восторгов в духе Мафекинга Судят ли иезуитов из Уорикшира тут же привратник поносит теорию двусмысленности Вернулся ли Отважный мореход с Бермудских островов пишется тут же пьеса что восхитила Ренана и в ней  Пэтси Калибан наш американский кузен Слащавые сонеты явились вслед за сонетами Сидни А что до феи Элизабет или же рыжей Бесс разгульной девы вдохновившей Виндзорских проказниц то уж пускай какойнибудь герр из Неметчины всю жизнь раскапывает глубинные смыслы на дне корзины с грязным бельемЧто ж у тебя совсем недурно выходит Вот только еще подпусти чегонибудь теологофилологологического     Докажите что он был еврей  решился предложить Джон Эглинтон  Вот ваш декан утверждает будто он был католик   В Германии  отвечал Стивен  из него сделали образцового французского лакировщика итальянских скандальных басен Несметноликий человек  сметливо припомнил мистер Супер  Кольридж его назвал несметноликим             Святой Фома  начал Стивен     пробурчал Монах Маллиган опускаясь в креслоИ запричитал с жалобным подвываньем     Теперь не иначе пропали мы Как пить дать пропалиВсе внесли по улыбке Святой Фома  сказал улыбаясь Стивен  чьи толстопузые тома мне столь приятно почитывать в оригинале трактует о кровосмесительстве с иной точки зрения нежели та новая венская школа о которой говорил мистер МагиВ своей мудрой и своеобычной манере он сближает его со скупостью чувствИмеется в виду что отдавая любовь близкому по крови тем самым как бы скупятся наделить ею того кто дальше но кто быть может жаждет ееЕвреи которым христиане приписывают скупость больше всех наций привержены к единокровным бракам Но обвинения эти  по злобе Те же христианские законы что дали евреям почву для накопления богатств ведь им как и лоллардам убежищем служили бури оковали стальными обручами круг их привязанностей Грех это или добродетель  лишь старый Никтоотец откроет нам в Судный день Но человек который так держится за то что он именует своими правами на то что он именует себе причитающимся  он будет цепко держаться и за то что он именует своими правами на ту кого он именует своей женой И пусть никакой окрестный сэр смайл не пожелает вола его или жены его или раба или рабыни его или осла его Или ослицы его  возгласил антифонно Бык Маллиган С нашим любезным Биллом сурово обошлись  любезно заметил мистер Супер сама любезность С какой волей мягко вмешался Бык Маллиган  Мы рискуем запутаться Воля к жизни  пустился в философию Джон Эглинтон  была волею к смерти для бедной Энн вдовы Вилла  помолился СтивенВоли к действию уж нетИ в помине много лет И все же она положена охладелая на эту на второсортную кровать поруганная царица хотя б вы и доказали что в те дни кровать была такой же редкостью как ныне автомобиль а резьба на ней вызывала восторги семи приходов На склоне дней своих она сошлась с проповедниками один из них останавливался в НьюПлейс и получал кварту хереса за счет города однако не следует спрашивать на какой кровати он спал и прослышала что у нее есть душа Она прочла или же ей прочли книжицы из его котомки предпочитая их Проказницам и облегчаясь в ночной сосуд размышляла о Крючках и Петлях для Штанов Истинно Верующего и о Наидуховнейшей Табакерке что Заставляет Чихать Наиблагочестивейшие Души Венера изогнула свои уста в молитве Жагала сраму угрызения совести Возраст когда распутство выдохшись начинает себе отыскивать бога История подтверждает это      Один возраст жизни сменяется другим Однако мы знаем из высокоавторитетных источников что худшие враги человека  его домашние и семья Мне кажется Рассел прав Какое нам дело до его жены до отца Я бы сказал что семейная жизнь существует только у поэтов семейного очага Фальстаф не был человеком семейного очага А для меня тучный рыцарь  венец всех его созданийТощий откинулся он назад Робкий отрекись от сородичей своих жестоковыйных праведников Робкий в застолье с безбожниками он тщится избегать чаши Так ему наказал родитель из Ольстера из графства АнтримНавещает его тут в библиотеке ежеквартально Мистер Маги сэр вас там желает видеть какойто господин Меня Он говорит что он ваш отец сэрПодайте ка мне Вордсворта Входит Маги Мор Мэтью в грубом сукне косматый керн на нем штаны с гульфиком на пуговицах чулки забрызганы грязью десяти лесов и ветка яблонидичка в рукахА твой Он знает твоего старикана ВдовецСпеша из веселого Парижа в нищенскую лачугу к ее смертному ложу на пристани я коснулся его руки Голос звучавший неожиданной теплотой Ее лечит доктор Боб Кении Взгляд что желает мне добра Не зная меня однако Отец  произнес Стивен пытаясь побороть безнадежность  это неизбежное зло Он написал знаменитую пьесу вскоре после смерти отца Но если вы станете утверждать что он седеющий муж с двумя дочерьми на выданье в возрасте тридцати пяти лет        и добрых пятидесяти по своему опыту  что он и есть безусый студиозус из Виттенберга тогда вам придется утверждать что его старая мать уже лет семидесяти это похотливая королева Нет Труп Джона Шекспира не скитается по ночам Он с часу и на час гниет Отец мирно почиет сложивши бремя отцовства и передав сие мистическое состояние сыну Каландрино герой Боккаччо был первым и последним мужчиной кто чувствовал будто бы у него ребенок Мужчина не знает отцовства в смысле сознательного порождения Это  состоянье мистическое апостольское преемство от единорождающего к единородному Именно на этой тайне а вовсе не на мадонне которую лукавый итальянский разум швырнул европейским толпам стоит церковь и стоит непоколебимо ибо стоит как сам мир макро и микрокосм  на пустоте На недостоверном невероятном Возможно что   родительный субъекта и объекта  единственно подлинное в мире Возможно что отцовство  одна юридическая фикция Где у любого сына такой отец что любой сын должен его любить и сам он любого сынаКуда это тебя понесло черт побериЗнаю Заткнись Ступай к черту На то у меня причины   Или ты обречен этим заниматься Телесный стыд разделяет их настолько прочной преградой что мировые анналы преступности испещренные всеми иными видами распутств и кровосмесительств почти не сообщают о ее нарушениях Сыновья с матерями отцы с дочерьми лесбиянкисестры любовь которая назвать себя не смеет племянники с бабушками узники с замочными скважинами королевы с быкамирекордистами Сын пока не

этого на рю МсьелеПренс Что в природе их связывает Миг слепой похотиА я отец А если бы былСморщенная неуверенная рука Африканец Савеллий хитрейший ересиарх из всех зверей полевых утверждал что Сам же Отец  Свой Собственный Сын Бульдог Аквинский которого ни один довод не мог поставить в тупик опровергает его Отлично если отец у которого нет сына уже не отец то может ли сын у которого нет отца быть сыном Когда Ратлендбэконсаутхемптоншекспир или другой какойнибудь бард с тем же именем из этой комедии ошибок написал Гамлета он был не просто отцом своего сына но больше уже не будучи сыном он был и он сознавал себя отцом всего своего рода отцом собственного деда отцом своего нерожденного внука который заметим в скобках так никогда и не родился ибо природа как полагает мистер Маги не терпит совершенстваГлаза эглинтоньи вмиг оживившись искорку удовольствия метнули украдкой Весел и радостен пуританина взгляд хоть игл полн тонПольстить Изредка Но польстить Сам себе отец  пробормотал сам

продолжал Стивен  то имя матери его живет в Арденском лесу Ее смертью навеяна у него сцена с Волумнией в Кориолане Смерть его сынамальчика  это сцена смерти юного Артура в Короле Иоанне Гамлет черный принц это Гамнет Шекспир Кто были девушки в Буре в Перикле в Зимней сказке  мы уже знаем Кто была Клеопатра котел с мясом в земле Египетской и кто Крессида и кто Венера мы можем догадываться Но есть и еще один член его семейства чей след  на его страницах Интрига усложняется  заметил Джон ЭглинтонБиблиоквакерпрыгун вернулся припрыгивая на цыпочках личина его подрагивает суетливо подпрыгивает поквакиваетДверь затворилась Келья ОгниОни внимают Трое ОниЯ Ты Он ОниНачнемте ж судариСтивен У него было три брата Гилберт Эдмунд Ричард Гилберт рассказывал в старости неким благородным господам как однова случись Господин Кассир пожаловали ему вот не соврать дармовой билет и как видал он там в этом самом Лонноне свово брательника что сочиняет пиесы господина Виля в камеди со знатною потасовкой а у того здоровый детина сидел на закорках Колбаса что продавали в партере преисполнила Гилбертову душу восторгом Он сгинул бесследно  но некий Эдмунд и некий Ричард присутствуют в сочинениях любящего ВильямаМагиглинджон Имена Что значит имяСупер Ричард понимаете это же мое имя Я надеюсь у вас найдется доброе словечко для Ричарда понимаете уж ради меняСмехБык Маллиган  Тут промолвил медик ДикСвоему коллеге ДэвиСтивен В его троице черных Биллов злокозненных смутьянов Яго Ричардгорбун и Эдмунд в Короле Лире двоим присвоены имена злых дядюшек И кстати еще эту последнюю пьесу он писал или собирался писать в то самое время когда его брат Эдмунд умирал в СаутуоркеСупер Я надеюсь что на орехи попадет Эдмунду Я не хочу чтобы Ричард мой тезкаСмехКвакерлистер   Но тот кто незапятнанное имя мое крадетСтивен  Он запрятал свое имя прекрасное имя Вильям в своих пьесах дав его где статисту где клоуну как на картинах у старых итальянцев художник иногда пишет самого себя гденибудь в неприметном уголку Но он выставил его напоказ в Сонетах где Вильям преизобилует Как для Джона оГонта его имя дорого для него столь же дорого как щит и герб ради которых он пресмыкался на черном поясе золотое копье с серебряным острием   и дороже чем слава величайшего в стране потрясателя сцены Что значит имя Этот вопрос каждый задает себе в детстве когда впервые пишет то имя которое как объясняют ему есть его имяЗвезда сияющая и днем огнедышащий дракон поднялась в небесах при его рождении Она одиноко сияла средь бела дня ярче чем Венера ночью а по ночам светила над дельтой Кассиопеи созвездия что раскинулось среди звезд изображая его инициал Его взгляд останавливался на ней стоящей низко над горизонтом восточной медведицы когда в полночный час он проходил летними дремлющими полями возвращаясь из Шоттери и из ее объятийОни оба довольны Я тожеТолько не говори им что ему было девять лет когда она исчезлаИ из ее объятийЖдешь пока тебя улестят и обольстят Эх ты тихоня Кто тебя станет

явление Ночью  звезда  отвечал Стивен  Днем же  облачный столпО чем еще сказатьСтивен окинул взглядом свою шляпу трость башмакиСтефанос мой венец Мой меч А эти башмаки его только уродуют ноги Надо купить пару Носки дырявые И носовой платок надо Вы неплохо обыгрываете его имя  признал Джон Эглинтон  А ваше собственное довольно странно Как мне кажется оно объясняет ваш эксцентрический склад умаЯ Маги и МаллиганЛегендарный искусник Человексокол Ты летал Куда же Ньюхейвен  Дьепп низшим классом Париж и обратно Зуек Икар   Упал барахтается в волнах захлебывается Зуек вот ты кто Быть зуйкомМистер Супер в тихом воодушевлении поднял блокнот Это очень интересно потому что мотив брата понимаете встречается и в древнеирландских мифах Как раз то о чем вы говорите Трое братьев Шекспиров И то же самое у Гриммов понимаете в сказках Там всегда третий брат  настоящий супергерой он женится на спящей принцессе и все такоеСупер из супербратьев Хороший получше суперБиблиоквакер припрыгал и стал подле Мне бы хотелось полюбопытствовать  начал он  о ком это вы из братьев Как я понял вы намекаете что были предосудительные отношения с одним из братьев Или может быть это я забегаю впередОн поймал себя с поличным  поглядел на всех  смолкПомощник позвал с порога Мистер Листер Отец Дайнин просит Ах отец Дайнин СейчассейчасБыстрым шагом часчас с бодрым скрипом часчас он часчас удалилсяДжон Эглинтон стал в позицию Ну что ж  произнес он  Посмотрим что у вас найдется сказать про Ричарда и Эдмунда Вероятно вы их приберегли напоследок Ожидать чтобы вы запомнили двух благородных родичей дядюшку Ричи и дядюшку Эдмунда  парировал Стивен  как видно значит ожидать слишком многого Братьев забывают так же легко как зонтикиЗуекГде брат твой У аптекаря Мой оселок Он потом Крэнли потом Маллиган  а теперь эти Речи речи Но действуй же Действуй речью Они насмешничают проверяя тебя Действуй Отвечай на действияЗуекЯ устал от собственного голоса голоса Исава Полцарства за глотокВперед Вы скажете что это просто имена из тех хроник откуда он брал себе материал для пьес А почему тогда он выбрал эти а не другие Ричард горбатый злодей бастард приударяет за овдовевшей Энн что значит имя улещает и обольщает ее злодей  веселую вдову Ричардзавоеватель третий брат царствует после Вильямапобежденного И все остальные четыре акта драмы не то что зависят а прямотаки висят на этом первом Ричард  единственный из всех королей кого Шекспир не ограждает почтенья долгом суетным как мир Почему побочный сюжет в Короле Лире где действует Эдмунд утащен из Аркадии Сидни и пристегнут к кельтской легенде доисторической древности Уж так делал Вилл  вступился Джон Эглинтон  Это не значит что мы сегодня должны склеивать скандинавскую сагу с обрывком романа Мередита    как сказал бы Мур У него и Богемия находится на берегу моря а Одиссей цитирует Аристотеля Почему  продолжал Стивен сам отвечая себе  Потому что тема братаобманщика братазахватчика братапрелюбодея или же брата в котором все это сразу была тем для Шекспира чем нищие не были тем что всегда с собой Мотив изгнания изгнания из сердца изгнания из дома звучит непрерывно начиная с Двух веронцев и до того момента когда Просперо ломает жезл свой зарывает в землю и топит книги в глубине морской Этот мотив раздваивается в середине его жизни продолжается в другом повторяется протасис эпитасис катастасис катастрофа Он повторяется вновь когда герой уже на краю могилы а его замужняя дочь Сьюзен вся в папочку обвиняется в прелюбодействе Однако онто и был тот первородный грех что затемнил его понятия расслабил волю и вселил в него упорную тягу ко злу Таковы точные слова господ епископов МанутскихПервородный грех и как первородный грех содеян он был другим грехами которого он также грешил Он кроется между строками последних слов им написанных он застыл на его надгробии под которым не суждено было покоиться останкам его жены Время над ним не властно Красота и безмятежность не вытеснили его В тысячах видов он рассеян повсюду в мире созданном им в Много шума из ничего дважды  в Как вам это понравится в Буре в Гамлете в Мере за меру  и во всех прочих пьесах коих я не читалОн рассмеялся чтобы ум его сбросил оковы его ума Истина посредине  подытожил судия Эглинтон  Он призрак и он принц Он  все во всем Именно так  подтвердил Стивен  Мальчишка из первого акта  это зрелый муж из акта пятого Все во всем В Цимбелине в Отелло он сводник и рогоносец Он действует и отвечает на действия Влюбленный в идеал или в извращенье он как Хозе убивает настоящую Кармен Его неумолимый рассудок  это Яго одержимый рогобоязнью и жаждущий чтобы мавр в нем страдал не зная покоя Ррога Ррога  Рык Маллиган прорычал похабно  Опасный звук Приводит он мужей в испугТемный купол уловил и откликнулся Да Яго Что за характер  воскликнул неиспугавшийся Джон Эглинтон Когда все уже сказано остается лишь согласиться с Дюмасыном Или с Дюмаотцом После Господа Бога больше всех создал Шекспир Мужчины не занимают его и женщины тоже  молвил Стивен  Всю жизнь свою проведя в отсутствии он возвращается на тот клочок земли где был рожден и где оставался всегда и в юные и в зрелые годы немой свидетель Здесь его жизненное странствие кончено и он сажает в землю тутовое дерево Потом умирает Действие окончено Могильщики зарывают Гамлетаотца и Гамлетасына Он наконецто король и принц в смерти с подобающей музыкой И оплакиваемый  хотя сперва ими

единым махом очутился у стола Эглинтона Вы позволите  спросил он  Господь возговорил к МалахииОн принялся чтото кропать на библиотечном бланкеБудешь уходить  захвати бланков со стойки Кто уже в браке  возвестил мистер Супер сладостный герольд  пусть так и живут все кроме одного Остальные пускай попрежнему воздерживаютсяВ браке отнюдь не состоя он засмеялся глядя на Эглинтона Иоанна искусств

Эглинтон Стивену  Вы нас заставили проделать весь этот путь чтобы в конце показать банальнейший треугольник Вы самито верите в собственную теорию Нет  отвечал Стивен незамедлительно А вы не запишете все это  спросил мистер Супер  Вам нужно из этого сделать диалог понимаете как те платонические диалоги что сочинял УайльдДжон Эклектикон улыбнулся сугубо В таком случае  сказал он  я не вижу почему вы должны ожидать какойто платы за это коль скоро вы сами в это не верите Доуден верит что в Гамлете имеется какаято тайна но больше ничего говорить не желает Герр Бляйбтрой тот господин с которым Пайпер встречался в Берлине развивает версию насчет Ратленда и думает что секрет таится в стратфордском памятнике Пайпер говорил будто бы он собирается нанести визит нынешнему герцогу и доказать ему что пьесы были написаны его предком Это будет такой сюрприз для его сиятельства Однако он верит в свою теориюВерую Господи помоги моему неверию То есть помоги мне верить или помоги мне не верить Кто

люди Черны только вороны попы и английский угольПрерывистый смешок слетел с его уст Лонгворт чуть ли не окочурился  сообщил он  изза того что ты написал про эту старую крысу Грегори Ах ты надравшийся

чтобы переступить через тебя лежащего в своей винноцветной разноцветной и изобильной блевотине Невиннейший из сыновей Эрина  откликнулся Стивен  ради которого когдалибо юбки поднималисьПочти у самого

Каннингема Да Оказать ему эту услугу если можно Добрый католик соблюдает обряды помогает в сборах на церковьОдноногий матрос продвигаясь вперед ленивыми бросками своих костылей прорычал какието звуки Возле монастыря сестер милосердия он оборвал броски и протянул фуражку за подаянием к высокопреподобному Джону Конми ОИ Отец Конми благословил его под щедрыми лучами солнца памятуя что в кошельке у него только серебряная кронаОтец Конми свернул к Маунтджойсквер Мысли его ненадолго задержались на солдатах и матросах которые лишились конечностей под пушечными ядрами и доживают остаток дней в нищенских приютах а также на словах кардинала Уолси Если бы я служил Богу своему как я служил своему королю Он бы не покинул меня в дни старости  Он шел под деревьями в тени играющей зайчиками листвы навстречу же ему приближалась супруга мистера Дэвида Шихи ЧП Благодарю вас просто прекрасно А вы святой отецОтец Конми себя чувствовал поистине превосходно Он собирался в Бакстон на воды А как ее сыновья у них все хорошо в Бельведере Правда Отец Конми был поистине очень рад это слышать А как сам мистер Шихи Еще в Лондоне Ну да конечно парламент ведь еще заседает Какая прекрасная погода право на редкость Да это весьма возможно что отец Бернард Вохен возобновит свои проповеди О да огромный успех Поистине необыкновенный человекОтец Конми был очень рад повидать супругу мистера Дэвида Шихи ЧП и рад что она так хорошо выглядит Он попросил передать его наилучшие пожелания мистеру Дэвиду Шихи ЧП Да он непременно их навестит Всего доброго миссис ШихиОтец Конми приподнял свою шелковую шляпу в прощальном приветствии стеклярусу ее мантильи чернильно поблескивающему на солнце И вновь улыбнулся уходя Он знал что его зубы почищены пастой с пальмовым масломОтец Конми шел и на ходу улыбался вспоминая чудаковатые глаза отца Бернарда Вохена и его сочные лондонские словечки Пилат Да что ж ты не разогнал весь этот сброд в шеюНо в рвении ему не откажешь Никоим образом И несомненно приносил много пользы на свой манер Этого тоже не отнять Он говорил что любит Ирландию и любит ирландцев Кстати ведь из хорошей семьи кто бы подумалКажется из УэльсаО берегитесь чтоб не забыть Письмо к отцупровинциалуОтец Конми остановил трех малышейшкольников на углу МаунтджойскверДа они были из Бельведера Из приготовительного ага И хорошо себя ведут в школе Оо Ну тогда очень хорошо А как тебя зовут Джек Сохен А тебя Джер Галлахер А этого молодого человека Его звали Бранни ЛайнемНу как приятно носить такое красивое имяОтец Конми достав письмо из внутреннего кармана вручил его юному Бранни Лайнему и указал на красный столбикящик на углу Фицгиббонстрит Смотри только сам не проскочи в ящик малыш  пошутил онМальчуганы шестиглазея на отца Конми засмеялись О сэр Нус покажи как ты умеешь опускать письма  сказал отец КонмиЮный Бранни Лайнем перебежал через дорогу и сунул письмо отца Конми к отцу провинциалу в щель яркокрасного почтового ящика Отец Конми улыбнулся кивнул опять улыбнулся и зашагал по восточной стороне МаунтджойскверМистер Дэнис ДжМаджинни учитель танцев и пр в цилиндре в сероголубом сюртуке с шелковыми лацканами в белом галстуке в узких сиреневых брюках канареечных перчатках и лаковых остроносых штиблетах выступая с внушительною осанкою наипочтительнейше свернул на обочину обгоняя леди Максвелл на углу ДигнамскортА это не миссис МакгиннессМиссис Макгиннесс статная седовласая поклонилась отцу Конми с соседнего тротуара по которому она величаво проплывала Отец Конми улыбнулся и отдал поклон Как она поживаетКакая великолепная манера Есть нечто в ней прямо как у Марии СтюартИ только подумать  процентщица Ну и ну С такой как бы это сказатьс такой царственной минойОтец Конми следовал по ГрейтЧарльзстрит поглядывая налево на закрытую протестантскую церковь Преподобный ТРГрин бакалавр искусств будет  читать проповедь Он у них называется бенефициарием Полатыни благодетель Решил их облагодетельствовать проповедью Но будем однако снисходительныНепреодолимое неведение Действуют по мере света им даннойОтец Конми повернул за угол и зашагал по Северной окружнойУдивительно что нет трамвайной линии на такой важной магистралиБесспорно тут должна бытьС Ричмондстрит высыпали гурьбой школьники с ранцами за спиной и все как один приподняли измятые фуражки Отец Конми несколько раз благосклонно покивал им Из школы Христианских братьевС правой стороны до отца Конми донесся запах ладана Церковь Святого Иосифа Портлендроу Для престарелых и добродетельных особ женского полаОтец Конми обнажил голову пред совершающимся Святым Таинством Да добродетельны  но иногда просто невыносимыПроходя мимо особняка Олдборо отец Конми подумал про этого расточительного аристократа А теперь тут какаято контора или нечто подобноеОтец Конми вышел на Северную Стрэндроуд где его приветствовал мистер Вильям Галлахер стоявший в дверях своей лавки Отец Конми приветствовал мистера Вильяма Галлахера и ощутил запахи исходившие от пластов бекона и объемистых кубов масла Он миновал табачную торговлю Грогана опершись на которую газетные щиты сообщали об ужасной катастрофе в НьюЙорке В Америке то и дело подобные происшествия Какое несчастье для людей вот так умереть без приуготовления Хотя еще остается акт совершенного сокрушенияОтец Конми прошел мимо трактира Дэниэла Бергина возле окон которого прислонились к стене двое праздных мужчин Они поклонились ему и получили ответный поклонОтец Конми миновал похоронное заведение ГДжОНила где Корни Келлехер жуя сухую травинку подбивал сумму в своем гроссбухе Констебль делавший обход приветствовал отца Конми и отец Конми приветствовал констебля В витрине Юкстеттера торговца свининой отец Конми окинул взглядом свиные колбасы белые черные и красные свернутые аккуратными кольцамиПод деревьями Чарлвиллмэлл отец Конми увидел причаленную торфяную баржу свесившую голову лошадь в лямках и лодочника в грязной соломенной шляпе который сидел на барже покуривая и глядя на ветку тополя над головой Картина была идиллической  и отец Конми задумался о мудром провидении Творца создавшего торф в болотах дабы люди могли его извлекать оттуда и привозить в город и делать из него топливо согревающее домы бедняковНа мосту Ньюкомен высокопреподобный Джон Конми ОИ из церкви святого Франциска Ксаверия что на Верхней Гардинерстрит сел в трамвай идущий от центраС трамвая идущего к центру на мост Ньюкомен сошел преподобный Николае Дадли викарий церкви святой Агаты что на Северной ВильямстритНа мосту Ньюкомен отец Конми сел в трамвай идущий от центра поскольку он не любил ходить пешком по грязной дороге мимо МадайлендОтец Конми уселся в углу вагона аккуратно засунув синий билетик в глазок одной из своих толстых лайковых перчаток а четыре шиллинга шестипенсовик и пять монеток по пенни скользнули в его кошелек с ладони обтянутой другою толстою лайковою перчаткою Проезжая мимо церкви увитой плющом он размышлял о том что контролер непременно является тогда когда по беспечности выбросишь свой билет Торжественный вид пассажиров казался отцу Конми излишним для такой краткой и дешевой поездки Отец Конми любил непринужденную обстановкуДень был безмятежным Джентльмен в очках сидевший напротив отца Конми перестал чтото объяснять и опустил взгляд Жена его подумал отец КонмиЕдва заметный зевок чутьчуть приоткрыл рот жены джентльмена в очках Она подняла маленький кулачок в перчатке зевнула опять столь же деликатно похлопывая себя по губам своим маленьким кулачком и улыбнулась чутьчуть мягкомягкоЗапах ее духов привлек внимание отца Конми Его внимание также привлекло что неуклюжий мужчина по другую сторону от нее сидит на самом краешке своего сиденьяОтец Конми стоя на амвоне не без труда вложил гостию в рот неуклюжего старика с трясущейся головойТрамвай остановился на мосту Эннсли и уже трогался снова когда какаято старушка неожиданно поднялась к выходу Кондуктор дернул за веревку звонка чтобы остановить трамвай для нее Она вышла с корзинкой и с рыночной плетенкой Отец Конми видел как кондуктор помогал ей сойти с этою корзинкою и плетенкой  и зная что она чуть не проехала дальше чем полагалось за пенни отец Конми подумал что она была одной из тех добрых душ которым всегда надо повторять по два раза благословляю тебя дитя мое  что грехи им отпущены молись за меня Но ведь у них столько тревог в жизни столько забот бедные созданияС афишных щитов мистер Юджин Стрэттон ухмылялся отцу Конми толстыми негритянскими губамиОтец Конми подумал о душах всех чернокожих темнокожих и желтокожих людей о своей проповеди на тему о святом Петре Клавере ОИ и африканской миссии о распространении истинной веры и о миллионах черных коричневых и желтых душ что не успели принять крещенья водой когда их смертный час подкрался яко тать в нощи Как полагал отец Конми в той книге бельгийского иезуита     отстаивалась разумная точка зрения Ведь все миллионы человеческих душ что не были  обращены в истинную веру были тем не менее души которые сотворил Господь по Своему образу и подобию Все это были Божьи души сотворенные Богом И отцу Конми казалось жаль что все они должны быть потеряны как пустые отходы если так можно выразитьсяНа остановке Хоутроуд отец Конми высадился и в ответ на прощальный поклон кондуктора также поклонился емуМалахайд роуд была безлюдна Отцу Конми нравились и эта улица и ее название Веселый звон колоколов над Малахайд плывет Лорд Толбот де Малахайд по прямой линии наследный лордадмирал Малахайда и прилежащих морей Свадебные колокола и тут же  набат к оружию и она оказывается девицей супругою и вдовой в один день То были стародавние дни пора беззаботных городков не знавших крамолы давняя баронская старинаОтец Конми продолжая путь подумал о своей небольшой книжке Баронская старина и о той книге которую можно было бы написать о домах иезуитов и о Мэри Рочфорт дочери лорда Моулсворта первой графине БельведерПечальная женщина немолодая уже одиноко бродила по берегам озера Эннел Мэри первая графиня Бельведер печально бродившая вечерами и всплеск выдры нырнувшей в воду не вызывал у нее ни удивления ни испугаКто мог знать правду Не лорд Бельведер снедаемый ревностью и не ее исповедник если только она не совершала прелюбодеяния до конца до       с братом своего мужа Она бы исповедалась лишь наполовину если бы согрешила не до конца женщины поступают так И знали бы только Бог и она и он брат ее мужаОтец Конми думал о неумолимом плотском влечении без которого не может однако продлиться род людской на земле и о путях Божиих которые не суть пути нашиДон Джон Конми продолжая идти перенесся во времена оны Он был там почитаем и добр Он хранил в своей памяти исповедальные тайны и улыбался улыбающимся благородным лицам в гостиных с навощенным паркетом с пышными гроздьями плодов по плафонам И руки жениха и невесты благородного и благородной соединял ладонями дон Джон КонмиСтоял чудный деньСквозь калитку на поле отцу Конми показались гряды капусты кочаны кланялись ему широко разводя нижние листья Небо показало ему стадо небольших белых облачков медленно плывущих по ветру  говорят французы Меткое слово и такое уютноеОтец Конми читая молитвенное правило следил за барашками облаков над Рэткоффи Поля Клонгоуза покалывали своей стерней его лодыжки в тонких носках По вечерам он гулял там творя молитвы и слушал возгласы мальчиков занятых своими играми юные возгласы в тихом вечернем воздухеОн был у них ректором  и правил над ними с кротостьюОтец Конми снял перчатки и вынул свой молитвенник с красными уголкамиЗакладка слоновой кости указывала страницуЧас девятый Это надо было прочесть еще до обеда Но пришла леди МаксвеллОтец Конми прочитал мысленно Отче наш и Аве Мария и перекрестился   Он шел в спокойствии неслышно читая службу девятого часа шагал и шагал читая пока не дошел до Реш в            Раскрасневшийся юноша выбрался на тропу через просвет в живой изгороди за ним девушка с поникшими полевыми ромашками в руке Юноша поспешно приподнял свою шляпу девушка поспешно поклонилась и старательно принялась снимать с юбки приставший к ней стебелекОтец Конми степенно благословил обоих и перевернул тоненькую страничку молитвенника Шин            Корни Келлехер захлопнул толстый гроссбух и глянул лениво на сосновую крышку гроба стоявшую на часах в углу Он выпрямился подошел к ней и повертев вокруг оси осмотрел ее поверхность и медные украшения Жуя сухую травинку он положил крышку на пол и отошел к выходу Там он надвинул шляпу так чтобы тень падала на глаза и прислонился к косяку двери бесцельно глядя на улицуОтец Джон Конми на мосту Ньюкомен сел в трамвай в сторону ДоллимаунтаКорни Келлехер сомкнув свои огромные башмаки в надвинутой на лоб шляпе глазел по сторонам жуя сухую травинкуКонстебль С патрульный на обходе остановился рядом с ним скоротать минутку Отличный день мистер Келлехер Угу  пробурчал Корни Келлехер Только вот душно  сказал констебльКорни Келлехер пустил дугою сквозь зубы беззвучную струю травяного сока а щедрая белая ручка бросила

тележку мороженщика от Рабайотти и запрыгал на костылях по ЭкклсстритПриближаясь к Ларри ОРурку стоявшему у себя в дверях без пиджака он вызывающе рявкнул За Англию Резкими раскачивающимися рывками он продвинулся вперед мимо Кейти и Буди Дедал остановился и рявкнул дом и красуБледному изглоданному заботой лицу ДжДжОМоллоя было сказано что мистер Лэмберт на складе с посетителемГрузная дама остановилась вынула медяк из своего кошелька и бросила в протянутую к ней фуражку Матрос пробурчал благодарность угрюмо глянул на безучастные окна и опустив низко голову сделал еще четыре раскачивающихся рывка впередПотом остановился и в сердцах рявкнул За Англию Двое босоногих мальчишек сосущих длинные палочки лакрицы остановились возле него разинув на искалеченный обрубок свои желтослюнявые ртыОн мощными рывками продвинулся еще вперед остановился поднял к окну голову и прорычал низким басом дом и красу Веселое щебетанье и посвистыванье за окном еще продолжалось одиндва

впереди ухватившись за поручни Бледнолицые Руки мужчин без стеснения обвивали их щуплые талии Они смотрели со стороны Тринити на глухой весь в колоннах портал Ирландского банка где гургургулили голуби

Долки   торопливо и дружески сказал Альмидано Артифони             отозвался Стивен высвободившейся рукою приподымая шляпу       спросил Альмидано Артифони      Альмидано Артифони подняв как сигнал свернутые в трубку ноты в своих обширных штанах устремился вслед за трамваем из Долки Тщетно стремился он подавая тщетно сигналы средь толчеи голоногих горцев протаскивавших музыкальные принадлежности через ворота ТринитиМисс Данн засунула подальше в стол Женщину в белом взятую из библиотеки на Кейплстрит и заправила в свою машинку цветастый лист почтовой бумагиСлишком тут много всего таинственного Любит он эту Мэрион или нетЛучше поменять да взять чтонибудь Мэри Сесил ХэйДиск скользнул вниз по желобку немного покачался затих и показал им в окошечке шестьМисс Данн отстучала по клавишам  июня Пять фигур в белых цилиндрах с рекламными щитами прозмеились между углом Монипени и постаментом где не было статуи Вулфа Тона повернулись показав  и проследовали назад откуда пришлиПотом она уставилась на большую афишу с изображением Марии Кендалл очаровательной субретки бездумно откинувшись и черкая в блокноте цифры шестнадцать и заглавные Эс Горчичные волосы и размалеванные щеки Что тут

выступили в мерцании слабого огонька Кто это  спросил Нед Лэмберт  Это Кротти что ли Рингабелла и Кроссхейвен  отозвался голос человека нащупывающего ногой ступеньки А это вы Джек здравствуйте  сказал Нед Лэмберт приветственно поднимая гибкую рейку к мерцающим сводам  Идите сюда Учтите что там ступенькиСпичка в поднятой руке священника изошла длинным гибким язычком пламени и была брошена Ее последняя искорка умерла у их ног  и затхлый воздух сомкнулся вокруг них Как интересно  произнес отточенный выговор во мраке Да сэр  подхватил с живостью Нед Лэмберт  Мы с вами стоим в той самой исторической палате аббатства святой Марии где на совете шелковый Томас объявил о начале мятежа в  году Это ведь самое историческое место во всем Дублине ОМэдден Берк собирается вскорости о нем чтонибудь написать До унии тут помещался старый Ирландский банк и самый первый еврейский храм тоже тут был пока они не построили свою синагогу на Аделаидроуд Джек вы ведь тут раньше никогда не были Нет не случалось Он въезжал через Дэймуок  произнес отточенный выговор  если мне память не изменяет Замок Киллеров был в Томаскорт Это верно  сказал Нед Лэмберт  Совершенно верно сэр Если вы будете столь добры  произнес священник  то возможно в следующий раз вы мне позволите Ну конечно  сказал Нед Лэмберт  Приносите фотоаппарат когда вам угодно Я распоряжусь чтобы эти мешки убрали бы с окон Вы сможете снимать вот отсюда или отсюдаОн двигался в слабом мигающем свете постукивая своей рейкой по грудам мешков с зерном и по удобным местам на полуС вытянутого лица нависали над шахматной доской борода и пристальный взгляд Я глубоко признателен мистер Лэмберт  сказал священник  Не буду более занимать вашего драгоценного времени Всегда буду рад вам  сказал Нед Лэмберт  Заходите когда угодноМожно на следующей неделе Вам видно Да да Всего доброго мистер Лэмберт Было приятно познакомиться Мне тоже очень приятно сэр  отвечал Нед ЛэмбертОн проводил гостя к выходу и на дворе зашвырнул свою рейку между колонн Вместе с ДжДжОМоллоем они вышли неторопливо на аббатства Марии где ломовики нагружали на фургоны мешки с альгарробой и с пальмовой мукой ОКоннор ВексфордОн остановился прочесть визитную карточку которую держал в руке Преподобный Хью КЛав Рэткоффи Адрес в настоящее времяСент Майклс Соллинс Очень славный малый Он мне сказал он пишет книгу о Фицджеральдах В истории отлично подкован ейбогуДевушка старательно принялась снимать с юбки приставший к ней стебелек А я подумал вы тут затеваете новый пороховой заговор  сказал ДжДжОМоллойНед Лэмберт щелкнул пальцами в воздухе Фу черт  воскликнул он  Я же забыл ему рассказать про графа Килдерского после того как тот поджег кафедральный собор в Кэшеле Знаете эту историю Чертовски сожалею что я это сделал так он сказал но только готов поклясться я думал что архиепископ был там внутри  Хотя ему могло не понравиться А Нет все равно расскажу ему Это был великий граф Фицджеральд Мор Они все были горячие головы эти ДжералдайныЛошади мимо которых он проходил беспокойно подергивались в распущенной упряжи Он шлепнул по чалопегому крупу что вздрагивал совсем рядом с ним и прикрикнул Нно балуйПотом обернулся к ДжДжОМоллою и спросил Ну ладно Джек В чем дело Что там стряслось Ох погодите минуткуДержитеськаОткинув далеко голову и разинув рот он на мгновение застыл неподвижно после чего громко чихнул Апчхи  произнес он  Черт побери Это пыль от мешков  вежливо заметил ДжДжОМоллой Да нет  выдохнул Нед Лэмберт  это я подхватил холодная ночь поза вот дьявол ночь позавчера и такие гуляли сквознякиОн приготовил носовой платок для уже подступающего Я был утром бедный как его зовут Апчхи Вот сатанаТом Рочфорд взял верхний диск из стопки которую он прижимал к своему бордовому жилету Видите  спросил он  Допустим сейчас идет шестой номер Кладу вот сюда смотрите Номер На СценеУ них на глазах он опустил диск в левую щель Диск скользнул вниз по желобку слегка покачался и затих показывая им в окошечке шестьЮристы былых времен важные и надменные отправляя дела закона взирали как Ричи Гулдинг прошел из податного управления в гражданский суд с папкою фирмы Гулдинг Коллис и Уорд и слышали как от адмиралтейского отделения королевского суда к суду апелляционному прошуршала пожилая особа женского пола с недоверчивою усмешкою открывшей вставные зубы в черной шелковой юбке весьма пространной Видите  повторил он  Смотрите последний что я опустил теперь там сверху Прошедшие Номера Давление Принцип рычага понятноОн показал им растущую стопку дисков на правой стороне Ловко придумано  сказал Флинн Длинный Нос сопя  Значит кто опоздал может видеть какой сейчас номер и какие уже прошли Видите  повторил Том РочфордОн опустил диск для собственного удовольствия  и наблюдал как тот скользит вниз качается затихает и показывает четыре Номер На Сцене Я его сейчас увижу в Ормонде  сказал Ленехан  и я его прощупаюЧтоб путный номер даром не помер Давай  одобрил Том Рочфорд  Скажи ему я уж тут

Ленехан  Да это было в люкеОни миновали мюзикхолл Дэна Лаури где на афише им улыбалась размалеванной улыбкой Мария Кендалл очаровательная субреткаИдя вниз по тротуару Сайкморстрит мимо мюзикхолла Эмпайр Ленехан представлял Маккою как было дело Один из этих чертовых люков прямо как газовая труба и какойто бедолага застрял там причем наполовину уже задохся от канализационных газов Ну Том Рочфорд тут же лезет вниз в чем был при всем букмекерском параде только обмотался канатом И убей бог он както ухитрился обмотать того бедолагу канатом и обоих вытянули наружу Геройский поступок  заключил онУ Дельфина они остановились и пропустили карету скорой помощи галопом промчавшуюся на Джервисстрит Вот сюда  сказал он сворачивая направо  Заскочу к Лайнему поглядеть начальные ставки на Корону Сколько

что он покупает  сказал Маккой оглядываясь назад Леопольде или История заблумшей души  сказал Ленехан Он просто помешан на распродажах  сказал Маккой  На днях мы шли с ним по Лиффистрит и он купил книгу у какогото старика за два шиллингаТак в этой книге одни гравюры стоили вдвое там звезды луна кометы с хвостами Чтото насчет астрономииЛенехан рассмеялся Сейчас вот я вам одну историйку про

снова принялся он  Делахант с Кэмденстрит обеспечил весь стол а ваш покорнейший был за главного виночерпия Блум тоже там был со своей женой Выпивки хоть залейся  портвейн и херес и кюрасо и уж мы всему там воздали честь Разгулялись на славу От жидкостей  к твердым телам Холодный филей навалом паштеты Я знаю  сказал Маккой  В тот год когда моя дражайшая там былаЛенехан с большим жаром обнял его под локоть Да нет дайте мне рассказать  повторил он  После всей этой увеселительности мы еще устроили легкий полночный завтрак и когда мы отчалили то уж было времени хренадцатый час того утра что после ночиДомой возвращались в дивную зимнюю ночь через гору Фезербед Блум и Крис Каллинан были на одной стороне кареты а я с его женой  на другой Мы там принялись распевать квартеты дуэты Взгляни уж

могу  задыхался онБледное лицо Маккоя на миг улыбнувшись приняло строгое выражениеЛенехан зашагал дальше Он приподнял свою капитанку и быстрым движением почесал затылок Под ярким солнцем он искоса бросил взгляд на Маккоя Блум  человек знающий и культурный  произнес он серьезно  Это не какойнибудь простофиля с улицы понимаете Наш старина Блум в нем гдето чувствуется артистМистер Блум лениво

потускневшую от времени цепочку Пыль подернула паутиной окно и полки витрины От пыли потемнели усердные пальцы с ястребиными когтями Пыль дремала на тусклых завитках бронзы и серебра на ромбиках

Сводник и мясник так я сказал Еще бы Но погоди малость ОглядисьДа совершенно верно Большие замечательные прославленной точностиСовершенная правда сэр В понедельник утром как вы сказалиСтивен спускался по Бедфордроу ясеневой рукояткой трости постукивая себя по лопатке В витрине у Клохисси взгляд его привлекла выцветшая гравюра  года изображающая боксерский матч между Хиненом и СейерсомЗа канатами глазели на ринг сделавшие ставки зрители в допотопных шляпахТяжеловесы в тесных набедренниках любезно протягивали друг другу шарообразные кулаки Они тоже бьются  сердца героевОн повернул за угол и

прядямиГоревшее румянцем когда сидя у огня она в него подбрасывала старые башмаки Я ей рассказывал о Париже Любила подольше поваляться в постели укрывшись старым тряпьем без конца теребя свой браслетик под золото подарок Дэна Келли   Что это у тебя  спросил Стивен На другом лотке купила за пенни  сказала Дилли с нервным смешком  Она годится на чтонибудьГоворят у нее мои глаза Таким вот и видит меня взор прочих Живым смелым и отчужденным Тень моего умаОн взял у нее из рук книгу с оторванной обложкой Шарденаль французский язык для начинающих Зачем ты это купила  спросил он  Учиться пофранцузскиОна кивнула покраснев и сжав плотно губыНе показывай удивления Вполне естественно Держи  сказал Стивен  Годится почему ж нет Смотри чтобы Мэгги ее не унесла у тебя в заклад Я так думаю мои книги туда все ушли Часть из них  ответила Дилли  Нам пришлосьВедь она тонет Жагала Спасти ее Жагала Все против нас Она утопит и меня с собой глаза и волосы Гладкие кольца волосводорослей обвивают

звучным рукопожатием возле магазина Редди и Дочь Отец Каули сложив ладонь лодочкой мелкими движениями пригладил усы Ну что хорошенького  спросил мистер Дедал Да небогато  отвечал отец Каули  В дом свой Саймон не попаду два субъекта у входа караулят чтоб было право войти Как мило  отозвался мистер Дедал  А кто это постарался Да так  сказал отец Каули  Некий процентщик из числа наших знакомых Тот что спина крюком  спросил мистер Дедал Он самый Саймон  отвечал отец Каули  Рувим из колена Рувимова Я тут как раз поджидаю Бена Долларда Он должен пойти к Длинному Джону да замолвить за меня словечко чтобы он убрал этих двух Мне бы только дали немного времениВ смутной надежде он кинул взгляд туда и сюда по набережной Его крупный кадык заметно выдавался на шее Знаю знаю  сказал кивая мистер Дедал  Старый сердяга БенВечно старается для когонибудь ПогодитекаОн нацепил пенсне и на секунду всмотрелся в направлении чугунного моста Подходит  возвестил он  Явился собственнозадно прости ГосподиСтаромодная шляпа и просторная синяя визитка Бена Долларда над мешковатыми брюками на всех парах двигались через набережную от чугунного моста Он приближался к ним рысцой рьяно почесывая у себя под фалдамиМистер Дедал приветствовал его появление Держитека мне вот этого в дурацких штанах Нуну давайте  отозвался Бен ДоллардМистер Дедал с холодным презрением оглядел Бена Долларда с головы до ног Затем кивая на него отцу Каули он язвительно процедил Какой удачный наряд для летнего дня не правда ли Чточто  прорычал свирепо Бен Доллард  Да разрази вас гром я на своем веку столько сносил костюмов сколько вам и во сне не снилосьСтоя рядом он лучезарно улыбался им и своему пространному одеянию с которого мистер Дедал сбивал там и сям пушинки приговаривая Нет что ни говори Бен это сшито на мужчину в расцвете сил Да провалиться тому еврею который сшил это  отозвался Бен Доллард Слава богу ему еще не заплачено А как поживает ваш   Бенджамин  спросил отец КаулиКэшел Бойл ОКоннор Фицморис Тисделл Фаррелл омоноклив глаз чтото невнятно бормоча прошагал мимо клуба на КилдерстритБен Доллард нахмурил брови и сделав вдруг рот как у певца издал низкую ноту Оо  прогудел он Вот это класс  заметил мистер Дедал одобрительно кивнув Ну как  вопросил Бен Доллард  Не заржавел пока АОн обернулся поочередно к обоим Подходяще  сказал отец Каули и тоже кивнулПреподобный Хью КЛав шел от бывшего здания капитула аббатства святой Марии мимо спиртоочистительного завода Джеймса и Чарльза Кеннеди в сторону Фолсела что за скотопрогонным бродом и воображению его рисовались целые сонмы Джералдайнов один другого осанистей и отважнейБен Доллард грузно кренясь в сторону магазинных витрин увлекал их вперед весело жестикулируя пальцами Пойдемтека вместе со мной в полицию  говорил он  Я вам хочу показать какого красавчика Рок недавно зачислил в приставы Нечто среднее между вождем зулусов и Джеком Потрошителем Стоит взглянуть уверяю васПойдемте Я только что встретил случайно Джона Генри Ментона в Бодеге и это мне дорого обойдется если я не Погодите малость Наше дело верное Боб можете мне поверить Вы ему скажите мне бы несколько дней  сказал отец Каули с тоскливой тревогойБен Доллард резко остановился и уставился на него разинув свой звучный зев Оторванная пуговица визитки ярко поблескивая закачалась на своей ниточке когда он принялся вытирать слезящиеся глаза чтобы лучше слышать Какие еще несколько дней  прогремел он  Ваш домохозяин разве не подал ко взысканию Подал  сказал отец Каули Ну а тогда исполнительный лист нашего друга не стоит и той бумаги на которой написан  заявил Бен Доллард  Право первого иска всегда за домохозяином Я ему сообщил все сведения Виндзоравеню  Его фамилия Лав Да да  сказал отец Каули  Его преподобие мистер Лав Он кажется священник гдето в провинции Но вы точно уверены Можете от меня передать Варавве  сказал Бен Доллард  чтобы он сунул этот лист туда где мартышки прячут орехиОн решительно увлекал за собой отца Каули прикованного к его туше Я думаю не грецкие а лесные  пробормотал мистер Дедал следуя за ними и опуская пенсне на лацканы своего сюртука Насчет мальчика все в порядке  сказал Мартин Каннингем когда они проходили мимо ворот КаслярдаПолисмен дотронулся до фуражки Дай вам Бог  ободряюще произнес Мартин КаннингемОн сделал знак поджидавшему кучеру тот дернул вожжи и тронулся в сторону ЛордЭдвардстритЗа бронзой золото за головкой мисс Кеннеди головка мисс Дус появились над занавеской отеля Ормонд Дада  сказал Мартин Каннингем потрагивая бороду  Я написал отцу Конми и все изложил ему Вы бы могли попытаться и у нашего друга  предложил задним числом мистер Пауэр У Бойда Благодарю покорно  отрезал коротко Мартин КаннингемДжон Уайз Нолан отставший за чтением списка быстро пустился их нагонять по КоркхиллНа ступенях ратуши советник Наннетти спускаясь приветствовал поднимающихся олдермена Каули и советника Абрахама ЛайонаМуниципальный фургон пустой завернул на Верхнюю Эксчейнджстрит Взглянитека Мартин  сказал Джон Уайз Нолан догнав их возле редакции Мейл  Я тут вижу что Блум подписался на пять шиллингов Совершенно верно  сказал Мартин Каннингем забирая у него лист  Мало того он их немедленно внес Без громких речей  заметил мистер Пауэр Довольно странно но факт  добавил Мартин КаннингемДжон Уайз Нолан удивленно раскрыл глаза Как много у еврея доброты замечу я  щегольнул он цитатойОни направились по Парламентстрит А вот и Джимми Генри  сказал мистер Пауэр  как раз поспешает к Каване Раз так  сказал Мартин Каннингем  то и мы за нимВозле    Буян Бойлан изловил горбатого зятя Джека Муни бывшего в подпитии и направлявшегося в слободкуДжон Уайз Нолан с мистером Пауэром шли теперь позади а Мартин Каннингем взял под руку маленького аккуратного человечка в сером с искрой костюме который нетвердой торопливой походкой проходил мимо часового магазина Микки Андерсона Видно у младшего муниципального секретаря мозоли дают себя знать  заметил Джон Уайз Нолан мистеру ПауэруОни обогнули угол следуя к винному погребу Джеймса Каваны Пустой муниципальный фургон стоявший у Эссексгейт оказался перед самым носом у них Мартин Каннингем все продолжал говорить то и дело показывая Джимми Генри подписной лист на который тот ни разу не глянул И Длинный Джон Феннинг тоже здесь  сказал Джон Уайз Нолан  во всю натуральную величинуВысокая фигура Длинного Джона Феннинга заполняла собой всю дверь Добрый день господин главный инспектор  произнес Мартин Каннингем и все остановились для обмена приветствиямиДлинный Джон феннинг не освободил им проход Резким движением он вынул изо рта большую сигару и его круглые глаза пронзительно окинули их умным и хищным взглядом Сенаторы Рима продолжают предаваться мирной беседе  проговорил он звучно и насмешливо обращаясь к младшему муниципальному секретарюУстроили там адские баталии заговорил с раздражением Джимми Генри вокруг своего треклятого ирландского языка Он бы хотел знать чем занимается распорядитель когда надо поддерживать порядок в зале заседаний А старый Барлоу хранитель жезла слег изза своей астмы жезла на столе нет сплошной кавардак нет даже кворума и сам лордмэр Хатчинсон в Лландудно а маленький Лоркан Шерлок изображает его   Пропади он пропадом этот язык наших предковДлинный Джон Феннинг выпустил изо рта струю дымаМартин Каннингем покручивая кончик бороды снова принялся говорить обращаясь то к главному инспектору то к младшему муниципальному секретарю а Джон Уайз Нолан мирно помалкивал А какой это Дигнам  спросил Длинный Джон феннингДжимми Генри сделал гримасу и потряс в воздухе левой ногой Ох мои мозоли  жалобно простонал он  Пойдемте бога ради наверх чтобы я мог хоть присесть Уу Оххохо ПозвольтеВ сердцах он протиснулся сбоку от Длинного Джона Феннинга и поднялся по лестнице Да пойдемте наверх  сказал Мартин Каннингем главному инспектору  Мне кажется что вы не знали его хотя конечно возможноМистер Пауэр и Джон Уайз Нолан последовали за ними Он был скромный и честный малый  поведал Джек Пауэр дюжей спине Длинного Джона Феннинга которая поднималась навстречу Длинному Джону Феннингу в зеркале Небольшой такой Дигнам из конторы Ментона  дополнил Мартин КаннингемДлинный Джон Феннинг не мог припомнить егоВ воздухе пронеслось цоканье лошадиных копыт Что это  спросил Мартин КаннингемВсе обернулись где кто стоял Джон Уайз Нолан снова спустился внизСтоя в прохладной тени прохода он видел как кони двигались по Парламентстрит сбруя и лоснящиеся бабки поблескивали на солнце Весело не спеша они проследовали мимо под его холодным недружелюбным взглядомВпереди скакали впереди на седлах мерно подскакивали форейторы Так что это там  спросил Мартин Каннингем когда они снова начали подниматься Лорднаместник и генералгубернатор Ирландии  отвечал Джон Уайз Нолан с нижней ступенькиКогда они шли по толстому ковру Бык Маллиган прикрывшись своей панамой шепнул Хейнсу Брат Парнелла Вон в том углуОни выбрали маленький столик у окна напротив человека с вытянутым лицом борода и пристальный взгляд которого нависали над шахматной доской Вот это он  спросил Хейнс поворачиваясь на своем сиденье Да  ответил Маллиган  Это Джон Хауард его брат наш городской церемониймейстерДжон Хауард Парнелл спокойно передвинул белого слона и снова поднес грязноватый коготь ко лбу где он и остался неподвижноЧерез мгновение изпод его заслона глаза его бросили на противника быстрый неуловимо сверкнувший взгляд и вновь устремились на критический участок доски Мне кофе повенски  сказал Хейнс официантке Два кофе повенски  сказал Маллиган  И еще принесите нам масло булочки и какихнибудь пирожныхКогда она удалилась он со смехом сказал Мы тут говорим что ДХК значит дрянной холодный кофе Да но вы упустили Дедаловы речи о ГамлетеХейнс раскрыл свою свежеприобретенную книгу Мне очень жаль  сказал он  Шекспир  это благодатная почва для тех умов что утратили равновесиеОдноногий матрос приблизившись к Нельсонстрит  рявкнул Англия ждет Лимонный жилет Быка Маллигана весело всколыхнулся от смеха Вам стоит на него посмотреть  сказал он  когда его тело утрачивает равновесие Я его называю ЭнгусСкиталец Я уверен у него есть какаято    сказал Хейнс задумчиво пощипывая подбородок большим и указательным пальцами  И я раздумываю в чем бы она могла быть У таких людей она всегда естьБык Маллиган с серьезным выражением наклонился к нему через стол Ему свихнули мозги  заявил он  картинами адских мук И теперь ему уж никогда не достичь эллинской ноты Той ноты что из всех наших поэтов была у одного Суинберна и смерти белизна и алое рожденье едино сутьВот в чем его трагедия Ему никогда не стать поэтом Радость творчества Вечные мучения  произнес Хейнс учтиво кивая  да я понимаюСегодня утром я его слегка попытал на тему о вере Я видел у него засело чтото в уме Все это довольно любопытно потому что в Вене профессор Покорный из этого делает любопытные выводыБык Маллиган заметив бдительным оком приближение официантки помог ей освободить поднос В древнеирландском мифе ему не найти даже намека на ад  промолвил Хейнс оказавшись между бодрящих чаш  Похоже что там нет и нравственной идеи нет чувства судьбы возмездия Довольно странно что у него именно такая   Он какнибудь участвует в вашем литературном движенииЛовким жестом он запустил сбоку в чашку два куска сахара сквозь слой взбитых сливок Бык Маллиган разрезал еще горячую булочку и намазал маслом дышащую парком мякоть С большим аппетитом он основательно откусил от нее Десять лет  со смехом проговорил он жуя  Вот через столько он чтонибудь напишет Довольно изрядный срок  сказал Хейнс задумчиво подняв ложечку  И все же я не удивлюсь если ему удастся в конце концовОн снял и отведал ложечку с макушки белокремовой шапки на своей чашке Надеюсь что это настоящие ирландские сливки  снисходительно произнес он  Я не люблю

крысиные зубы он пробормотал  И зашагал дальше в сторону Клэрстрит пережевывая свои смелые словаКогда он вышагивал мимо окон мистера Блума дантиста его плащ болтаясь резко сбил в сторону тоненькую постукивавшую тросточку и повлекся дальше хлестнув по хилому телу Слепой юноша повернул вслед прохожему свое болезненное лицо Будь ты проклят кто ты там есть  воскликнул он с озлоблением  Не я слепой

воротничок вылез Задрав подбородок чтобы его застегнуть он увидел невдалеке от боксеров изображение Марии Кендалл очаровательной субретки Картинки с такими девками бывают в пачках от сигарет Стор за окурками охотится а его однажды родитель застукал как он курил и задал просто страшенную трепкуЮный Дигнам заправил свой воротничок и двинулся дальше По силе удара самый первый из боксеров это Фицсиммонс Такой даст разочек в поддых и ты очухаешься через неделю дружок Но самый первый по технике это был Джем Корбетт до тех пор пока Фицсиммонс не вышиб из него все его хитрости и все потроха в придачуНа Грэфтонстрит юный Дигнам увидал шикарного франта у которого был во рту красный цветок а на ногах ботинки  картинки и ему какойто пьяный все чегото толкует а он только ухмыляетсяТрамвая на Сэндимаунт все не былоЮный Дигнам пошел по Нассаустрит переложив свиные котлеты в другую руку Воротничок у него опять отстегнулся и он запихнул его обратноУродская запонка не подходит для этой дырки надоела до чертиков Ему повстречались школьники с ранцами Завтра опять не пойду останусь до понедельника Навстречу еще шли школьники Интересно они заметили что я в трауре Дядя Барни сказал он даст сегодня об этом в газету Тогда все в газете увидят и прочитают мое имя напечатанным и папино имяЛицо у него вместо красного как всегда было сделалось совсем серое и муха ползла по нему вверх к глазам Так скрипело когда ввинчивали винты в гроб и так глухо стукалось когда несли внизПапа был там внутри а мама плакала в зале а дядя Барни показывал как пронести на повороте Гроб был такой большой высокий тяжелый с виду Как все это было В последний вечер когда папа напился он стоял на лестничной площадке и орал чтоб ему дали башмаки он пойдет к Танни и там еще напьется и он казался таким толстым и низеньким в рубашке Больше никогда его не увижу Это называется смерть Папа умер Мой отец умер Он мне сказал чтобы я был маме хорошим сыном Я не мог разобрать что он еще говорил но я видел

для тенора сказал Ричи из СомнамбулыНекогда он ее слышал в исполнении Джо Мааса Ах этот Макгаккин Да В своей манере Под мальчика из церковного хора Этакий мальчик от мессыМесс мальчик Маас Лирический тенор если угодно Никогда этого не забудуНикогдаС чутким сочувствием Блум над беспеченочным беконом увидал как напряглись осунувшиеся черты Поясница у него И глаза блестят все как при воспалении почек Следующий номер программы Повеселился пора расплачиваться Пилюли толченый хлеб цена за коробочку  гинея Хоть чуть отсрочить Мурлычет Долой к покойникам Подходяще И ест почки нежнейшее  нежнейшей

Пиком А когда первая нотаТут сделали паузу уста РичиСейчас наплетет вранья О чем угодно насочиняет И верит сам в свои бредни Притом всерьез Редкостный враль Но всетаки память хорошая И какая же это ария  спросил Леопольд Блум Все уж потеряноРичи вытянул губы трубочкой Начальная нота нежная фея тихонько шепнула все Дрозд Пенье дрозда Его дыханье с легкостью певчей птицы сквозь крепкие зубы предмет его гордости как флейта высвистывало горькую жалобу Потеряно Сочный звук А тут две ноты в одной Както слышал скворца в кустах боярышника он у меня подхватывал мотив и переиначивал так и сяк Все новый новый зов зовет и уж потерян вновь во всем ЭхоСколь нежен отклик А как оно получается Все потеряно Скорбно высвистывал он Рухнуло отдано потеряноБлум ближе наклонив Леопольдово ухо поправлял краешек салфетки под вазой Порядок Да я помню Чудная ария Она к нему пошла во снеНевинность при лунном свете Все равно удержать ее Смелые не ведают об опасности Окликнуть по имени Дать коснуться воды Коляска позвякиваетПоздно Сама стремилась пойти В этом все дело Женщина Море удержать проще Да все потеряно Прекрасная ария  сказал Блум потерявший Леопольд  Я ее хорошо знаюРичи Гулдинг никогда в жизниОн тоже ее хорошо знает Или чувствует Все норовит о дочке Мудрое дитя что узнает отца как выразился Дедал ЯБлум искоса над беспеченочным наблюдал Печать на лице все потеряноЖивчик Ричи былых времен Одни избитые штучки остались Шевелить ушамиКольцо от салфетки в глаз Да сынка посылает со слезными прошениямиКосоглазого Уолтера да сэр исполнено сэр Ни за что не обеспокоил бы случайность

аккорды вступления Протяжно взывающему аккорду отозвался звенящий голос Когда явился дивный обликРичи обернулся Это Сай Дедал его голос  заметил онЗадетые за живое закрасневшись они слушали впитывали тот поток дивный поток струящийся по коже членам сердцу душе хребту Блум кивнул Пэту лысый служитель Пэт плохо слышит чтобы раскрыл двери бара Двери бара Вот так Хорошо Служитель Пэт послушно стал слушать глухарь тугоухий у самых дверей стал слушал Мои печали унеслисьСквозь тишину взывал к ним негромкий голос не дождя шелест не шепот листьев не похожий на голос ни струн ни свирелей ни какужихтам цимбалов касающийся их притихшего слуха словами их притихших сердец воспоминаниями о жизни  своей у каждого Полезно полезно слушать печали свои у каждого унеслись едва лишь они услышали Едва лишь они увидели все потерявшие Ричи Польди милосердие красоты услышали от того от кого уж никак не ждешь ее милосердное мягколюбовное нежнолюбимое словоЭто любовь поет Все та же старая сладкая

малость и дух вонФигура сидевшая на гигантском валуне у подножия круглой башни являла собою широкоплечего крутогрудого мощночленного смеловзорого рыжеволосого густовеснушчатого косматобородого большеротого широконосого длинноголового низкоголосого голоколенного стальнопалого власоногого багроволицего мускулисторукого героя В плечах он был нескольких косых саженей а колени его подобные горным утесам как и все остальное тело видное глазу густо покрыты были колючею рыжеватой порослью цветом и жесткостью походившей на дикий терн   Ноздри с широчайшими раскрыльями откуда торчали пучки волос того же рыжеватого цвета были столь дивно поместительны что в их сумрачной мгле полевой жаворонок без труда свил бы себе гнездо Глаза его в которых слеза и улыбка вечно оспаривали первенство превосходили размерами отборный кочан капусты Мощная струя горячего пара размеренно исторгалась из его бездонной груди и столь же ритмически могучие звучные удары его исполинского сердца громоподобными раскатами сотрясали почву заставляя содрогаться до самых вершин башню что вознеслась высоко и стены пещеры вознесшиеся еще вышеНа нем было длинное одеяние без рукавов из свежесодранной бычьей шкуры свободно ниспадавшее до колен словно килт и перехваченное в поясе кушаком из стеблей тростника и соломы Под этим одеянием имелись штаны из оленьей кожи грубо сшитые жилами Нижние конечности его защищали высокие болбриггенские гетры крашенные пурпурным лишайником а стопы были обуты в башмаки дубленой коровьей кожи зашнурованные трахеей того же животногоНа поясе подвешены были морские камешки побрякивавшие при каждом движении его устрашающей фигуры на них грубо но с поразительным мастерством были вырезаны изображения покровителей кланов древних героев и героинь Ирландии

просит ОлфТеренций ОРайен вняв слову его в тот же миг ему подал хрустальную чашу до краев полную пенистым темным элем который варили издавна в божественных своих чанах благородные близнецыбратья Пивайви и Пивардилон хитроумные подобно сыновьям Леды бессмертной Ибо сбирают они сочные плоды хмеля и ссыпают просеивают толкут и варят их и примешивают к ним терпкие соки и ставят сусло на священный

жестом ему он подал обол из бесценной бронзы Искусною рукою чеканщика был выбит на нем величавый лик королевы происходившей из дома Брунсвик Виктории именем Ее Августейшего Величества милостью Божией Соединенного Королевства Великобритании и Ирландии и британских заморских владений королевы защитницы веры императрицы Индии той что царствовала над несметными покоренными народами и была им любезна

Какойтакой  Джо спрашивает Вот она  говорит Олф выуживая монетку  Вы значит о повешенииТак я вам покажу сейчас чего вы сроду не видели Письма того кто вешаетВот глядитеИ вытаскивает из кармана целую

Чего про Дигнама  это снова Боб Дорен  А ну кто тут про Умер  говорит Олф  Да он не больше умер чем ты Уж не знаю  Джо говорит  Но только сегодня утром совершили такую вольность похоронили его Как Падди  говорит Олф Его самого  отвечает Джо  Исполнил закон природы помилуй Господи его душу Господи Иисусе  говорит ОлфЕй ей парень был что называется убийственно ошарашенВо тьме ощущалось как вибрировали руки духа и когда моление по тантрическому обряду было устремлено в надлежащую область сделалось постепенно видимым слабое но все нарастающее свечение рубинового оттенкаВ своем явлении эфирный двойник обретал подобие жизни в особенности за счет импульсов витальной энергии доставляемых аурой головы и лицаОбщение происходило посредством гипофизной железы а также лучей оранжевопламенного и алого цвета исходивших из сакральной области и солнечного сплетения Когда к нему обратились назвав его именем которое он носил в земной жизни и спросили о его пребывании в духовных мирах то он сообщил что в настоящее время проходит путь возвращения пралайю однако первоначально находится во власти неких кровожадных сущностей на низших астральных планах В ответ на вопрос о своих первых ощущениях по прохождении великого порога запредельных миров он сообщил что прежде видел как бы сквозь тусклое стекло однако переступившим порог открываются высочайшие возможности атмического развития Будучи спрошен о том напоминает ли жизнь там наше земное существование он сообщил что как слышал он от существ на более высоких ступенях в духовном мире их обиталища наделены всеми самыми современными домашними удобствами как то талафонтра лифтра сортиртра и атапалентра а посвященные самых высших ступеней купаются в чистейших и бесконечнейших наслаждениях Когда же он испросил кварту топленого молока то указанное было принесено и доставило явное облегчение Затем справились не желает ли он чтолибо передать живущим и он призвал всех кто еще пребывает на ложной стороне кто поглощен Майей вступить на путь истины ибо в кругах деванических стало известно что Марс и Юпитер находятся в противостоянии угрожая восточному дому где властвует овен Тогда осведомились нет ли каких особенных пожеланий со стороны усопших и ответ был Мы шлем вам привет наши земные друзья еще пребывающие во плоти Следите чтобы КК не заходил слишком далеко  Установлено было что инициалы относятся к мистеру Корнелиусу Келлехеру управляющему известной похоронной конторой ГДжОНила и другу усопшего лично ведавшему устройством и церемонией погребения Перед тем как удалиться он попросил также передать его любимому сыну Пэтси что второй ботинок который тот разыскивал лежит в настоящее время под комодом в угловой комнате и всю пару следует отнести к Коллену причем чинить лишь подметки поскольку каблуки вполне в целости Он добавил что это тяжко тревожило покой его духа в ином мире и убедительно просил об исполнении своей просьбыБыли даны заверения в том что все необходимое будет сделано и как можно было заметить это принесло удовлетворениеОн оставил жилища смертных ОДигнам солнце нашего утра Легким его стопам лесных уж не попирать папоротников о Патрик с челом сияющимОплачь его Банба своими ветрами и ты Океан ураганами своими Вон он опять там  говорит Гражданин выглядывая в окно Кто  говорю Да Блум  отвечает он  Как постовой мотается взадвперед вот уже минут десятьИ тут ейпра я заметил как его физия зыркнула внутрь и шасть тут же опять исчезлаА малыша Олфа как будто по башке треснули Не может в себя прийти Боже милостивый  говорит  Я же поклясться могу что это он былИ тут снова Боб Дорен шапка на затылке он просто жуткий громила делается когда на него найдет А нука кто тут сказал Боже милостивый Пердон сударь  говорит Олф Так потвоему это милость  рявкает Боб  что он у нас отнял нашего бедного Вилли Дигнама Ну понимаешь  юлит Олф пытаясь спустить на тормозах  сейчас его уже ничто не тревожитНо тут Боб как гаркнет Вонючий мерзавец вот он кто раз он отнял у нас нашего бедного Вилли ДигнамаТерри выходит и моргает ему чтоб он потише мол в ихнем приличном заведении таких разговоров не полагается И тогда Боб Дорен вот вам сущая правда начинает проливать горькую слезу над судьбой Падди Дигнама Прекраснейший человек был  ноет Боб всхлипывая  чистейшая прекраснейшая душаВ глазах твоих слеза чертовски близко И все несет свой собачий бредСтупал бы лучше к своей сучонке на которой его женили к блажной этой Муни дочке пристава из какогото захолустья Мамаша держала меблирашки на Хардвикстрит так она там вечно шлялась по лестницам мне Бэнтам Лайонс рассказывал бывало выйдет часа в два ночи в чем мать родила и так стоит гляди и приходи кто угодно доступ для всех на равных условиях Честнейший и благороднейший  Боб все ноет  И вот он скончался наш бедный Вилли то есть бедный наш Падди ДигнамВ глубокой скорби с тяжким бременем на душе оплакивал он угасший светоч небесТут старина Гарриоун опять заворчал на Блума что все крутился у двери Да заходите смелей не съест  говорит ГражданинБлум пробирается косясь на пса и спрашивает у Терри не был ли тут Мартин Каннингем Ах ты Господь МакКеун  говорит Джо еще все за письмами  Послушайтека вот это хотитеИ начинает зачитыватьЛиверпуль Хантерстрит  Начальнику дублинской полиции ДублинГлубокожаемый Сэр осмелюсь вам предложить свои услуги насчет помянутого деликатного дела как я повесил Джо Ганна в Бутлской тюрьме  февраля  года и еще повесил  Покажи покажика Джо  говорю рядового Артура Чейса за убивство Джесси Тильзит в Пентонвильской тюрьме и еще был помощником когда  Господи  говорю  Биллингтон казнил злодея убивца Тода Смита Тут Гражданин хотел было у него цапнуть письмо Потерпи  это Джо ему  а еще имею самоличный спосоп накидки петли так чтоб уже не выпутался и остаюсь со всей надеждой на вашу милость а также моя цена пять гиней ХРамболд Цирюльник  Этот цирюльник заслужил хороший пиндюльник  говорит Гражданин Грязная поганая тварь  Джо плюется  На  говорит  Олф заберика их с глаз долой Приветствую  говорит  Блум чего выпьетеНу тут они пошли препираться Блум я мол не хочу да я не могу да вы не сочтите за оскорбление и так далее а в конце концов говорит ладно тогда я пожалуй возьму сигару Ейей благоразумный субъект ничего не скажешь Дайка нам Терри самую лучшую из твоих вонючек  говорит ДжоОлф между тем толкует как один такой малый прислал открытку с соболезнованиями и с черной каймой вокруг Все эти  говорит  цирюльники из черных краев они за пять фунтов плюс дорожные расходы готовы отца родного повеситьИ начинает рассказывать как там при этом двое стоят внизу и тянут за ноги когда повиснет чтобы задохся как следует а потом они режут веревку на кусочки и продают выручают по нескольку шиллингов с головыВ темных краях обитают они мстительные рыцари бритвы Держат они наготове свое смертоносное вервие и неумолимо препровождают в Эреб всякого кто бы ни совершил кровавое злодеяние ибо отнюдь не буду терпеть того так говорит ГосподьТут они начали рассуждать насчет смертной казни и конечно Блум давай выступать со всякими почему да отчего со всей хренопруденцией этого дела а пес чтото все время его обнюхивает мне говорили от этих жидов какойто особый запах который собаки чуют и рассусоливает про средство устрашения и прочее в этом духе А я знаю одну штуку на которую не действует устрашение  это Олф Это какая же  Джо спрашивает Член того бедняги которого вешают  отвечает Олф Правда что ли  это Джо Чистейшая правда  Олф ему  Я сам слышал от главного надзирателя который был в Килмаинхеме когда там вешали Джо Брэди непобедимого Он говорит когда они сняли его с веревки то у него так и торчал прямо им в нос как свечка Страсть господствует и в смерти ктото там говорил  это Джо Наука это все объясняет  говорит Блум  Это естественный феномен понимаете ли поскольку за счетИ начинает сыпать слова от которых язык сломаешь про феномены да про науку мол тот феномен да еще вон тот феноменЗнаменитый ученый герр профессор Луитпольд Блюмендуфт представил медицинские основания в силу которых внезапный перелом шейных позвонков с проистекающим отсюда разрывом спинного мозга согласно надежным и проверенным принципам

мужского организма носящей название пенис или же половой член и вызывает феномен который именуется в медицине патологической филопрогенитивной вертикальногоризонтальной эрекцией      Гражданин уж само собой только повода ждал и тут же его вовсю понесло насчет непобедимых старой гвардии и героев шестьдесят седьмого года и про девяносто восьмой год не бойтесь говорить и Джо в одну дудку с ним обо всех кого повесили замучили судили военнополевым судом и за новую Ирландию за новое то да новое се Раз ты за новую Ирландию ты себе заведи для начала нового пса так я считаю А кабысдох паршивый кругом все обнюхивает слюнявит чешется и гляжу подбирается он к Бобу Дорену который выставляет Олфу полпинты и давай подлизываться к немуБоб ясное дело начинает с ним дурака валять Дай нам лапку Ну дай лапку песик Славный хороший песик Ну давай сюда лапку конец его лапанью песьих лап и наверняка он с табуретки приземлился бы на свои четыре прямо на окаянного пса не подхвати его Олф а сам все продолжает нести околесицу мол надо дрессировать лаской и пес породистый и пес умный так что аж тошно делается Потом просит Терри подать старую жестянку изпод печенья братьев Джекоб и начинает оттуда выскребывать крошки для пса Ну тот их проглотил одним духом и язык вывалил наружу просит еще Вместе с жестянкой чуть не слопал зверюгаА Гражданин с Блумом завели спор насчет всего этого про братьев Шире про Вулфа Тона невдалеке тут на Арборхилл про Роберта Эммета и гибель за родину и про плаксивый стих Томми Мура в честь Сэры Каррэн Она вдали от той земли Блум тут пыжится со своей сногсшибательной сигарой с жирной физиономией барина вовсю строит Феномен Жена его толстая туша тоже отличный феномен по спине хорошо кегельные шары катать Когда они жили в Городском гербе мне рассказывал Сикун Берк там была старуха одна с придурковатым племянником и Блум ее все пытался охмурить больного из себя корчил играл с ней в безик в тех видах значит чтоб потом ему обломилось по завещанию и мяса по пятницам не ел потому как старуха первостатейная ханжа и того блажного на прогулки водил И вот однажды повел он его по всем дублинским кабакам как добрый пастырь и все поддавал да поддавал пару пока не приволок домой упившимся хуже вареной совы причем объяснил что это он мол хотел ему преподать урок о вреде алкоголя а три бабы ейей чуть его не съели живьем это цирк та старуха жена его и миссис ОДауд хозяйка гостиницы Черт побери я со смеху лег когда Сикун передразнивал как там бабы костят его а он Блум все со своими но видите ли да но с другой стороны  А самоето интересное мне рассказывали что этот придурок работал потом у винного оптовика Пауэра на Коупстрит и каждый божий день домой возвращался на бровях после того как по службе перепробует всю продукцию в заведении Феномен Памяти павших  говорит Гражданин поднимает свою кружку и смотрит в упор на Блума Правильно  присоединяется Джо Но вы не улавливаете мою мысль  Блум ему  Я хочу сказать    перебивает его Гражданин     Любимые друзья бок о бок с нами заклятые враги  лицом к лицуПоследнее прощание было невыразимо трогательным Со всех ближних и дальних колоколен доносился несмолкаемый похоронный звон а повсюду вокруг назначенного места скорби раскатывалась зловещим предвестием приглушенная дробь сотен и сотен барабанов перемежаемая гулкими артиллерийскими залпами Оглушительные раскаты грома и яркие вспышки молний озарявшие ужасную сцену свидетельствовали о том что небесная артиллерия решила явить всю свою сверхъестественную мощь ради вящей грандиозности зрелища и без того вселявшего дрожь Разгневанные небеса разверзли хляби свои и проливной дождь потоками низвергался на обнаженные головы собравшихся толп в которых по самым скромным подсчетам было не менее пятисот тысяч человек Сводный отряд Дублинской городской полиции под личным руководством главного комиссара поддерживал порядок в этом обширном скоплении народа а чтобы скоротать время ожидания духовой оркестр Йоркстрит украсив инструменты траурным крепом предлагал слуху собравшихся великолепное исполнение той бесподобной мелодии которую уроднила нам с колыбели рыдающая муза Сперанцы Скоростные экскурсионные поезда и комфортабельные пассажирские кареты с мягкой обивкой предоставлены были к услугам наших провинциальных сородичей прибывавших большими группами Бурное оживление вызвали любимцы дублинской публики уличные певцы Лнхн и Мллгн со своим неизменным заразительным весельем исполнившие В ночь перед тем когда вздернули Ларри Два наших неподражаемых комика сделали фантастический сбор среди ценителей юмора продавая листовки со словами и музыкой своего коронного номера и ни один из тех кто лелеет в сердце любовь к истинно ирландской шутке лишенной тени вульгарности не попрекнет их оболом добытым в поте лица Детишки из Приюта Подкидышей Женского и Мужского Пола гроздьями облепившие окна что выходили к месту события были в восторге от этого нежданного дополнения к обычным забавам и тут по праву стоит сказать слова похвалы в адрес монахиньпопечительниц за их превосходную идею доставить бедным малышам лишенным матери и отца поистине поучительное зрелище Гости вицекороля среди которых можно было заметить многих блистательных светских дам в сопровождении Их Сиятельств проследовали к удобнейшим местам на большой трибуне между тем как живописная иностранная делегация известная как Друзья Изумрудного Острова разместилась на трибуне напротив В эту делегацию которая присутствовала в полном своем составе входили командор Бачибачи Бенинобеноне наполовину парализованный дуайен группы

заклеймили неслыханное варварство свидетелями коего предстояло им стать В дальнейшем среди ДИО завязался оживленный диспут о том какова истинная дата рождения святого покровителя Ирландии восьмое или девятое мартаАктивное участие приняли все В ходе дискуссии широко применялись пушечные ядра ятаганы бумеранги аркебузы дымовые завесы тесаки зонтики катапульты кастеты дубины чугунные болванки происходил непринужденный и щедрый обмен ударами Постовой Макфадден по прозвищу Мальчик с пальчик вызванный с нарочным из Бутерстауна во мгновение ока восстановил порядок и с блестящей находчивостью предложил в качестве решения спора семнадцатое число равно воздающее честь каждой из тяжущихся партий Предложение двухметрового самородка пришлось сразу по вкусу всем и было единодушно принято Сердечные поздравления постовому Макфаддену принесли все ДИО многие из которых были покрыты кровавыми ранами Командор Бенинобеноне был извлечен изпод председательского кресла и его юрисконсульт Адвокате Пагамими разъяснил что разнообразные предметы таившиеся в его тридцати двух карманах были им отчуждены во время побоища из карманов более молодых коллег в надежде призвать их к здравому смыслу Указанные предметы в том числе несколько сотен золотых и серебряных мужских и дамских часов были незамедлительно возвращены законным владельцам и торжество гармонии было полнымСпокойно и просто Рамболд поднялся на эшафот в безукоризненном деловом костюме с любимым своим цветком   в петлице Он возвестил о своем появлении тем милым чисто рамболдовым откашливаньем которому столь многие пытались и безуспешно подражать  коротким натужным неповторимо присущим лишь ему одному Прибытие всемирно прославленного палача было встречено бурей приветственных восторгов всей огромной массы собравшихся дамы из окружения вицекороля в экстазе размахивали платочками а иностранные делегаты в еще большем воодушевлении издавали ликующие клики слившиеся в многоголосый хор хох банзай эльен живио чинчин полла крониа гипгип вив Аллах  на фоне которого легко можно было различить звонкое эввива делегата из страны песен его высокое и долгое фа напоминало те дивные пронзительные ноты которыми евнух Каталани пленял наших прапрабабушек Ровно в семнадцать часов через мегафоны был подан сигнал к молитве и во мгновение ока головы всех были обнажены патриархальное сомбреро со времен революции Риенци принадлежавшее семье командора было бережно снято с головы последнего его дежурным личным врачом доктором Пиппи Высокоученый прелат явившийся предоставить героюмученику на пороге казни последние утешения нашей святой религии с истинно христианским смирением преклонил колена в луже дождевой воды задрав сутану на свою седовласую голову и обратил к престолу милосердия горячие и усердные молитвы Рядом с плахой возвышалась зловещая фигура совершителя казни чье лицо закрывал десятигаллоновый горшок с двумя круглыми прорезанными отверстиями сквозь которые яростно сверкали его глаза В ожидании рокового знака он пробовал остроту своего ужасающего оружия то подтачивая его о свое мускулистое предплечье то мгновенными взмахами отрубая головы барашкам доставленным для этой цели поклонниками его жестокого но необходимого искусства На изящном столике красного дерева перед ним аккуратно были разложены нож для четвертования набор инструментов для потрошения выполненных из лучшей стали по специальному заказу мастерами знаменитой шеффилдской фирмы Джон Раунд и Сыновья горшочек из терракоты куда по мере успешного извлечения должны были помещаться двенадцатиперстная кишка толстая кишка слепая кишка аппендикс и тд а также два вместительных молочных кувшина предназначенных для собирания драгоценнейшей крови драгоценнейшей жертвыЭконом Объединенного Приюта для Кошек и Собак имел предписание доставить эти сосуды по наполнении их в указанное благотворительное заведениеАппетитнейшая трапеза состоявшая из яичницы с беконом превосходно зажаренного бифштекса с луком горячих хрустящих булочек и бодрящего чая была любезно предложена устроителями главному герою трагедии который приготовившись к смерти демонстрировал отличное расположение духа и живой интерес ко всем деталям происходящего однако проникшись величием момента и проявив самоотречение небывалое в наши дни он выразил последнюю волю исполненную незамедлительно чтобы трапеза его была разделена поровну между членами Общества Больных и Неимущих Квартиросъемщиков в знак его внимания и почтения Волнение достигло  и    когда невестаизбранница прорвалась сквозь плотные ряды зрителей и бросилась зардевшись на его мужественную грудь грудь того кому через миг предстояло отправиться в вечность ради ее прекрасных глаз Герой любовно заключил в объятия ее гибкий стан шепча с нежностью Шейла моя любимая Воодушевленная звуками своего имени из его уст она покрыла страстными поцелуями все разнообразные части его особы каких только ее пылкость могла достичь через препоны его тюремных одежд Соленые ручьи их слез слились в единый поток и она поклялась ему что будет вечно хранить память о нем и никогда не забудет своего геройского парня который пошел на смерть с песенкой на устах как будто на хоккейный матч в парке Клонтерк Она напомнила ему златые дни счастливого детства которое они провели вместе на берегах Анны Лиффи в невинных отроческих играх Забыв весь ужас действительности они хохотали от души и зрители как один не исключая достопочтенного пастора предались вместе с ними дружному безудержному веселью Чудовищная толпа буквальнотаки помирала со смеху Однако скорбь вскоре взяла свое и вот уже они сплели свои пальцы в последний раз Ручьи слез хлынули с новой силой из их слезных протоков и все несметное собранье людей потрясенное до глубины разразилось душераздирающими рыданиями Сам престарелый служитель Господа был растроган отнюдь не менее остальных Рослые закаленные мужи блюстители порядка и добродушные исполины из ирландской королевской полиции не таясь прибегали к помощи носовых платков и можно с уверенностью сказать что ничьи глаза не остались сухими во всем этом грандиозном собрании Засим случилось романтичнейшее происшествие юный красавец выпускник Оксфордского университета известный своим рыцарским отношением к прекрасному полу выступил вперед и представив свою визитную карточку чековую книжку и родословное древо просил руки несчастной молодой леди умоляя немедленно назначить день свадьбы Его предложение с готовностью было принято Каждой даме из публики вручен был изящный сувенир в виде брошки с черепом и костями и этот дар столь щедрый и подобающий случаю вызвал новый прилив восторга Когда же галантный питомец Оксфорда  заметим попутно носитель одной из самых громких фамилий в истории Альбиона  надел на палец зардевшейся невесты бесценное обручальное кольцо с изумрудами образующими трилистник из четырех листьев общий энтузиазм перешел все границы Что говорить даже сам грозный глава военной полиции подполковник ТомкинМаксвелл Ффренчмаллен Томлинсон руководивший печальною церемонией тот самый что не моргнув глазом дюжинами отправлял в ад сипаев привязывая их к жерлам пушек не в силах был сдержать своих чувств Его рука в железной перчатке смахнула непрошеную слезу и те избранные бюргеры что составляли его ближайший  могли уловить прерывистый шепот Эх в богово ребро ну краля ну забористая бабенция В богово ребро так бы и взвыл глядя на нее как вспомнишь старую лоханку что поджидает дома в ЛаймхаусеИ тут Гражданин пошел толковать про ирландский язык заседание муниципалитета и все прочее да честить тех  которые не знают родного языка Джо тоже встревает раз уж он наколол когото на фунт и Блум туда же надсаживает глотку дымит своим грошовым окурком что выклянчил у Джо да разоряется про Гэльскую лигу и лигу противников угощения и что мол пьянство  это проклятье ИрландииНе угощать не выставлять дружкам выпивку  и все мол будет в порядкеЕще бы самто он зальет себе в пасть чего ты ему ни выставь а от него пены с пинты не дождешься до второго пришествия Я тут както пошел с приятелем на ихний музыкальный вечер танцы и песни она приляжет на стожок и скажет где ты мой дружок потом один деятель со значком Общества трезвости из кожи лез чесал поирландски и тут же целая куча   разгуливают с безалкогольными напитками медальки какието продают оранжад лимонад да занюханные пирожки  одно слово роскошь  развлечение Ирландия трезва  Ирландия свободна А потом какойто старый козел принимается дуть в волынку и вся эта похоронная компания притопывает ногами под музыку от которой корова сдохнет И ко всему еще двое длиннорясых орясин следят чтоб никто не подваливался к бабенкам  уж вовсе я скажу удар ниже поясаНу так да эдак о чем я бишь старая псина увидевши что жестянка пуста начинает егозить вокруг меня с Джо Будь он моим я б его подрессировал лаской я не я буду Хорошего пинка наподдать да потом снова напомнить чтобы не по глазам только Что боишься укусит  Гражданин ухмыляется Да нет  говорю  Только не принял бы он моей ноги за фонарный столбикОтозвал свою псину Ну чего ты ну чего Гарри  говорит емуИ давай его валять да трепать да толковать ему поирландски а этот шелудяга рычит в ответ так что у них выходит чистая опера с дуэтомТакого рычанья век не услышишь как они между собой развели Ктонибудь кому делать нечего пускай написал бы письмо в газеты    чтобы на таких вот собак непременно надевали намордники Рычит ворчит глаза налились кровью от жажды и с морды бешенство капаетВсе кто интересуется передачей человеческой культуры нашим низшим собратьям а имя им  легион никоим образом не должны упустить из виду поразительные проявления кинантропии продемонстрированные знаменитым рыжим ирландским сеттеромволкодавом который известен был прежде под  Гарриоун однако недавно обширным кругом друзей и знакомых был переименован в Оуна Гарри Указанные проявления итог многолетней дрессировки лаской и тщательно продуманной системы питания включают наряду с прочими достижениями также и чтение стиховКрупнейший из ныне здравствующих специалистов по фонетике имя его из нас не вытянут и клещами употребил гигантские усилия на то чтобы проделать сравнительный анализ читаемых стихов причем обнаружил разительное их сходство курсив наш с рунами древних кельтских бардов Мы говорим здесь не столько о тех прелестных любовных песнях с которыми познакомил мир книголюбов автор укрывшийся под очаровательным псевдонимом Хрупкая Веточка но скорее о тех более резких и личных как указывает некий мистер ДОК в интересном сообщении промелькнувшем в одном из наших вечерних изданий мотивах которые мы находим в сатирических излияниях знаменитого Рафтри а также Донола Макконсидайна не говоря уж о более современном лирике столь привлекающем ныне взоры просвещенного общества Ниже мы предлагаем один отрывок в переводе на наш язык принадлежащем видному ученому имя которого мы в настоящий момент не вправе открыть хоть мы и убеждены что читатель сумеет извлечь из местных аллюзий больше нежели простую подсказку Метрическая система собачьего подлинника напоминающая изощренные аллитеративные и изосиллабические правила валлийского энглина имеет гораздо большую сложность но как мы убеждены читатель не сможет не признать что общий дух донесен отлично Возможно стоит добавить что эффект несравненно увеличивается если читать стихи Оуна медленно и невнятно голосом напоминающим злобное сдавленное рычаниеПроклятья глухие Я шлю судорожно Семижды будь тошно Тебе Барни Кирнан Воды не дает ни глотка Остудить мою глотку Кишки мои все горят Потрохов лауриных хотятНу тут он попросил Терри принести псу воды и убей бог как тот хлебает было за милю слышно А Джо его спрашивает не против ли он если повторить Не откажусь  отвечает   чтоб ты не подумал будто я зло какое держуЕй ей он только прикидывается что у него на плечах кочан Шляется по всем кабакам с этой псиной старого Гилтрапа и ты моргнуть не успеешь обернет будто его угостить самая великая честь так вот и сидит на шее у избирателей и налогоплательщиков Вечный праздник для человека и зверя А Джо мне Ты как можешь еще одну А утка плавать может  говорю Повторика нам Терри  говорит Джо  А вы уверены что не желаете ничего из разряда прохладительных жидкостей  это он Блуму Нет спасибо  тот отвечает  Собственно я зашел сюда для встречи с Мартином Каннингемом понимаете ли по поводу страховых дел бедняги Дигнама Мартин меня попросил зайти в закладную контору Дело в том что он то бишь Дигнам заложил свою страховку и не уведомил страховую компанию а в этом случае по закону кредиторзакладчик не может ничего получить Потеха  смеется Джо  вот это отличный фокус старый Шейлок сам себя наколол А повезлото на этом его жене точно Что ж  говорит Блум  уж это дело ее поклонников Каких таких поклонников  это Джо Законников я хотел сказать адвокатов его жены  поправляется БлумИ начинает всякую муть про залоговое законодательство и как лордканцлер выносит решение и интересы вдовы и был создан фонд а с другой стороны Дигнам остался должен некую сумму Бриджмену и если теперь жена или вдова будут оспаривать права кредиторазакладчика пока не забил мне все мозги этим залоговым законодательством Он сам прохвост должен радоваться что не угодил под законодательство как мошенник и бродяга пусть скажет спасибо дружок в суде выручил Продавал какието липовые билеты под видом Венгерской королевской лотереи с привилегией от властейНе верите  побожусь Нет про евреев вы мне не говорите Венгерский королевский грабеж с привилегиейТут возникает пошатываясь Боб Дорен и просит Блума передать миссис Дигнам что он сочувствует ее горю и ему горько что он не мог быть на похоронах и передать ей что он сказал и каждый кто только знал его скажет что отродясь не бывало лучшего и честнейшего чем наш бедный Вилли ныне покойный передать ей Путаясь в словах как в соплях И жмет Блуму руку с трагическим видом передайте ей это Пожмем брат руки Ты мошенник и я мошенник Льщусь сударь надеждою  сказал он  что я не злоупотребляю нашим знакомством которое сколь ни казалось бы малым в рассуждении времени однако зиждется смею верить на обоюдном почтении решаясь испросить у вас сию милость Если же паче чаяния преступил я границы скромности то пусть сама искренность чувств моих послужит во извинение моей дерзости Помилуйте сударь  возразил собеседник  Я совершенно уважаю те побуждения коими вы были подвигнуты и не пожалею усердия на исполнение комиссии вашей утешаясь той мыслию что сколь ни печален к ней повод но уже самое изъявление доверия вашего ко мне чувствительно умягчает сей чаши горечь Тогда позвольте же мне пожать руку вашу  воскликнул он  Не усомнюсь что благородство вашего сердца верней нежели скудные мои словеса укажет вам каковым способом передать терзание столь жестокое что если б я отдался этому чувству оно лишило бы меня дара речиИ на том отчаливает стараясь держаться прямо В пять и уже мертвецкиОднажды ночью чутьчуть не попал в кутузку повезло что Падди Леонард знал того полисмена бляха А Накачался до бровей в притоне на Брайдстрит после часа закрытия да завел блудни с двумя шлюхами тут же ихний кот с ними и все глушат портер чайными чашками Назвался шлюхам будто бы он француз Жозеф Манюо и давай хулить католическую религию а сам между прочим еще мальчишкой прислуживал за мессой в церкви Адама и Евы глаза от восторга закрывал и про то кто сочинил новый завет и ветхий завет не забывая их лапать и обжимать Обе шлюхи со смеху подыхают обчистили у него остолопа все карманы пока он заливал кровать портером и визжат хохочут как очумелые Давай покажика твой завет А он шибко у тебя уже ветхий твой завет Хорошо Падди там как раз проходил А поглядеть на него в воскресенье как он со своей женойпотаскушкой в церкви она вертя задом шествует вдоль придела туфли лакированные не какнибудь на груди фиалки мила как пончик строит из себя барыньку Сестрица Джека Муни А мамаша старая курва сдает номера уличным парочкам Джек ему вправил мозги посвойски Посулил что пусть он только не женится на своих грехах из него живо дурь вышибутТерри стало быть приносит три кружки Прошу  говорит Джо потчуя нас  Прошу Гражданин    отвечает тот Твои успехи Джо  говорю  Бывай здоров ГражданинМать честная а уж тот больше половины своей махнул Его поить это только под силу миллионеру А кого долговязый хочет протолкнуть в мэры Олф  спрашивает Джо Одного твоего друга  тот отвечает Наннетти  спрашивает Джо  Члена Имен не называем  говорит Олф Я так и думал  говорит Джо  Я только что его видел еще с одним депутатом с Вилли Филдом на заседании скотопромышленников Иопад длинновласый  говорит Гражданин  извергающийся вулкан любимец всех стран и кумир своей собственнойИ Джо начинает заливать Гражданину про ящур скотопромышленников принятие срочных мер Гражданин эти меры посылает куда подальше а Блум давай толковать про серные ванны для лечения парши у овец и какие отвары от кашля для телят и про вернейшее средство от актиномикоза Когдато работал на живодерне Слонялся с блокнотиком и карандашиком путался у всех под ногами покуда Джо Кафф не наградил его орденом пинка за то что он нагрубил какомуто скотоводу Мистер Всезнайка Всех выучит кур доитьСикун говорил бывало его жена в Городском гербе все плачется миссис ОДауд слезы льет в три ручья на свои жировые складки Он ей не даст спокойно зад подтереть непременно привяжется мельтешит вокруг да учит

отправляются в Лондон и сделают об этом запрос в палате общин Вы уверены  спрашивает Блум  что советник уезжает Дело в том что я его хотел повидать С почтовым пароходом сегодня вечером  Джо отвечает Какое невезение  говорит Блум  Мне так надо было Может быть только мистер Филд уезжает Я не мог позвонить Нет Вы в самом деле уверены Наннан тоже уезжает  говорит Джо  Лига поручила ему сделать завтра запрос о том что комиссар полиции запретил ирландские виды спорта в парке Как тебе это Гражданин СлукнахЭйреаннМистер РогатиСкотт Молтифарнэм националист В связи с запросом моего уважаемого друга депутата от Шиллелы я бы хотел спросить глубокоуважаемого коллегу действительно ли правительством были отданы распоряжения о том чтобы упомянутых животных забивали невзирая на отсутствие медицинских признаков их патологического состоянияМистер Озверелл Тамошант консерватор Уважаемые члены палаты уже располагают сведениями которые были представлены комитету парламента Я не думаю что я мог бы добавить чтолибо существенное к этим сведениямОтвет на запрос уважаемого члена палаты будет утвердительнымМистер Орелли Монтенотте националист Отдавались ли аналогичные распоряжения касательно забоя животных человеческого рода дерзнувших заниматься ирландскими видами спорта в парке ФениксМистер Озверелл Ответ будет отрицательнымМистер РогатиСкотт А не повлияла ли знаменитая митчелстаунская телеграмма глубокоуважаемого коллеги на политику господ из казначействаШум в зале Мистер Озверелл По этому вопросу я должен справиться с материаламиМистер ПлоскиШутки Банком независимый Стреляйте без

собственной персоной Человек вырвавший из тюрьмы Джеймса Стивенса Чемпион всей Ирландии по метанию шестнадцатифунтового молота Какой у тебя лучший бросок Гражданин    тот отвечает напуская на себя скромность  Хотя в свое время и я был не хуже других Да уж оставь Гражданин  Джо ему  Другим за тобой и во сне было не угнаться Это что в самом деле  Олф спрашивает Дада  отвечает Блум  Хорошо известный факт А вы не зналиИ пошли они про ирландские виды спорта и про игры которыми тешатся  вроде лаунтенниса про ирландский хоккей и метание камня про почвенность и да будет нация опять и все такое Ну Блум само собой и тут должен высказаться мол если у кого слабое сердце то ему силовые упражнения вредны Клянусь своими подштанниками если подымешь с полу соломину и скажешь этому Блуму Гляди Блум Видишь эту соломину Это соломина   клянусь троюродной бабкой он будет про нее толковать битый час я точно вам говорю и не запнется ни разуВ старинной зале Брайена ОКирнона на СроднаБретонВегпри содействии СлукнахЭйреанн состоялась интереснейшая дискуссия о возрождении старинных гэльских видов спорта и о значении физической культуры как она понималась в Древней Греции Древнем Риме и Древней Ирландии для развития нации Достопочтенный президент благородной ассоциации занимал председательское кресло и публика была многочисленнойПосле содержательной речи председателя блиставшей красноречием и энергией завязалась интереснейшая и содержательнейшая дискуссия о желаемости возрождаемости древних игр и спортивных занятий наших древних панкельтских пращуров Дискуссия проходила на высшем уровне учтивости привычном в этом кругу Широко известный и глубоко почитаемый труженик на ниве нашего древнего языка мистер Джозеф Маккарти Хайнс горячо призвал воскресить древние гэльские спортивные игры и забавы каким предавался по утрам и вечерам Финн Маккул дабы оживить лучшие традиции мощи силы и мужества донесенные к нам из глубины веков ЛБлум который получил смешанный прием встретив как овации так и свист избрал противоположную точку зрения и председатель  вокалист уступая многочисленным просьбам и пылким аплодисментам со всех концов переполненной залы заключил дискуссию замечательным исполнением поистине неувядаемой песни Да будет нация опять на слова бессмертного Томаса Осборна Дэвиса к счастью слишком общеизвестные чтобы напоминать их здесь Не убоявшись противоречия мы скажем что в этом исполнении наш ветеран патриот и чемпион превзошел самого себя Ирландский КарузоГарибальди был в превосходной форме и его громовой голос как нельзя лучше явил себя в освященном временем гимне спетом так как мог спеть его только наш гражданин Великолепному пению которое своим сверхвысоким уровнем подняло еще выше его и без того высочайшую репутацию с жаром аплодировали массы собравшихся среди которых можно было увидеть многих видных деятелей нашего духовенства равно как представителей прессы судейского сословия и прочих просвещенных профессий На этом собрание закончилосьВ числе представителей духовенства находились высокопреподобный Вильям Делани ОИ доктор словесности преп Джеральд Моллой доктор богословия преп ПДжКавана Общины Святого Духа преп ТУотерс викарий преп

насчет силовых упражнений  говорит Олф  вы не были на этом матче Кео  Беннет Нет  отвечает Джо Как я слыхал мистер Такойто сделал на этом чистую сотню фунтов А кто Буян небось  Джо спрашиваетТут Блум влезает Вот например в теннисе там нужны ловкость и верный глаз Буян кто же  говорит Олф  Распустил слух будто бы Майлер пьет без просыпу чтоб на него не ставили а тот на самом деле целыми днями потел готовился Знаем мы его  говорит Гражданин  Сын предателя Знаем откуда у него английское золото в карманах Что верно то верно  соглашается ДжоТут Блум опять влезает про лаунтеннис и про кровообращение и спрашивает у Олфа А вы так не считаете Берген Майлер его по полу растер  гнет свое Олф  Матч Хинен  Сейерс  это детская шутка если сравнить Отлупил так что тот папу с мамой забылЭто надо видеть один  стручок едва до пупа тому а другой каланча знай молотит по воздуху Эх а под конец еще в поддых двинул От такого выблюешь чего и не жрал Правила Куинсбери все как надоТо был памятный и жестокий бой в котором Майлер и Перси оспаривали приз в пятьдесят соверенов Любимец Дублина будучи намного легче соперника с лихвой возмещал эту невыгоду своим фантастическим искусствомФейерверк финального раунда едва не стал роковым для обоих чемпионов В предыдущем раунде артиллеристтяжеловес для начала слегка пролил красного винца четко обработав любимцу нос так что Кео Главный Получатель и с правой и с левой выглядел как под мухой Солдат продолжил дело мощным коротким слева но тут ирландский гладиатор ответил молниеносным прямым целясь Беннету в челюсть Красный мундир сделал нырок но наш дублинец настиг его левым хуком отличнейшим ударом по корпусу Противники перешли в ближний бой Майлер развив бурную деятельность подавил своего соперника и к концу раунда здоровяк висел на канатах осыпаемый градом ударов Англичанин правый глаз которого совершенно заплыл удалился в свой угол и освежившись изрядным количеством воды к моменту гонга был снова бодр и полон отваги не сомневаясь что живо пошлет в нокаут бойца из Эбланы Это был бой до победы и победа ждала сильнейшего Оба дрались как тигры Волнение зрителей достигло предела Судья сделал Вояке Перси два предупреждения за захваты однако любимец был ловок и как работали его ноги  это стоило видеть После беглого обмена любезностями в ходе которого у Майлера кровь полилась изо рта ручьем от элегантного солдатского апперкота любимец вдруг резко перешел в наступление по всем фронтам и нанес Беннету ошеломляющий левый в живот Вояка рухнул на землю как сноп То был нокаут чистый и мастерский Среди напряженного молчания над портобелльским тузилой начали отсчитывать секунды Но тут Оле Пфоттс Веттштейн секундант Беннета выбросил на ринг полотенце и парень из Сентри был объявлен победителем под бешеные овации и крики зрителей которые хлынули на ринг и в бурном восторге едва не затоптали героя Уж онто своей выгоды не упустит  говорит Олф  Я слышал сейчас он устраивает концертное турне по северу Я тоже слыхал  говорит Джо  А что разве нет Кто  говорит Блум  Ах да Совершенно верно Нечто типа летних гастролей понимаете Так отдохнуть Миссис Б будет яркой и несравнимой звездой не так ли  Джо спрашивает Моя жена  говорит Блум  Да она будет петь Я думаю все должно быть успешно Он просто отличный организатор ОтличныйХо хо так вот оно что сказал я себе сказал Вот собакато где зарыта Буян исполняет мелодию на флейте Концертное турне Сынок вонючего симулянта с Айлендбридж старого Дэна который тех же лошадей продавал правительству по два раза во время бурской войны Мистер Чегочего Я к вам насчет налогов водного и на бедных мистер Бойлан Насчет чегоНалога водного мистер Бойлан Чегочего А этот хлыщ уж он организует ее это я вам ручаюсь Все между нами цыпочкаГордость скалистой Горы Кальпы дочь Твиди дева с волосами черней воронова крыла Там возрастала она там расцветала ее краса где мушмула и миндаль наполняют воздух своим ароматом Сады Аламеды знали легкую ее поступь оливковые рощи узнавали ее и кланялись клоня ветви То непорочная супруга Леопольда роскошногрудая МэрионИ се зрите грядет муж из клана ОМоллоев пригожий и белолицый с легким румянцем советник его величества в законах всеведущий и с ним принц и наследник благородного рода Лэмбертов Привет Нед Привет Олф Привет Джек Привет Джо Спаси вас Бог  говорит Гражданин Спаси и вас Он по Своей доброте  говорит ДжДж  Чего вы возьмете Нед Половинку  Нед отвечаетДжДж заказывает им выпить В суде толкались  Джо спрашивает Да  отвечает ДжДж  Он все устроит Нед  это он Неду Будем надеяться  говорит НедЗначит какие у этой пары делишки ДжДж устраивает чтобы того вычеркнули из списков присяжных а тот ему помогает перебиться Его имято уже у Стаббса Картеж да кутеж с шикарными вертопрахами при моноклях шампанское рекой и ясно завяз по шею в счетах да повестках в судЗакладывал свои золотые часы у Камминса на Френсисстрит где никто не знает его а я там возьми да и окажись с Сикуном тот как раз сапоги из заклада выкупал Как ваша фамилия сэр А он отвечает Палл Ага думаю этот крепко попалЕй ей однажды он горько обо всем пожалеет могу ручаться А вы там не видели этого чокнутого Брина  Олф спрашивает  Ккку ку Видели  отвечает ДжДж  Искал частного детектива Ага  это уже Нед  он было прямиком собрался к судье только Корни Келлехер его завернул сказал что надо сначала провести экспертизу почерка Десять тысяч фунтов  смеется Олф  Эх я бы дорого дал за то чтоб полюбоваться на него перед судьей и присяжными Небось твоя это работа Олф  Джо спрашивает  Говорите правду всю правду ничего кроме правды и да поможет вам Джимми Джонсон Моя  возмущается Олф  Прошу не капать на мою кристальную репутацию Любое заявление сделанное вами  Джо ему  может использоваться как свидетельство против вас Иск у него конечно должны принять  говорит ДжДж  Ведь там подразумевается что он не   Кк куку Засунь компос себе в нос  Олф смеется  Ты что не знаешь что он чокнутый Стоит взглянуть на его башку Ты знаешь что он по утрам себе помогает рожком для обуви когда надо на нее шляпу напялить Да  возражает ДжДж  но в глазах закона истинность порочащих сведений не освобождает от судебной ответственности за их огласку Айяйяй Олф  сочувствует Джо Но всетаки  говорит Блум  если подумать про бедную женщину я хочу сказать про жену его Да жаль ее  говорит Гражданин  И вообще всякую у которой муж ни то ни се Как это ни то ни се  Блум спрашивает  Вы хотите сказать Я хочу сказать ни то ни се  Гражданин повторяет  Такой который ни рыба ни мясо А черт знает что  говорит Джо Вот это я и хотел сказать  говорит Гражданин   если вам известно что это значитНу я чую каша заваривается Блум все объясняет он мол имел в виду как это жестоко когда бедная женщина всюду должна таскаться за своим тронутым заикой А что оно и впрямь жестокое обращение с животными когда Брина выпускают пастись нищего этого идиота бородой по земле метет от такой картинки небеса дождем прослезятся А онато еще нос задирала когда вышла за него как же его троюродный дядюшка  прислужник в церкви при самом папе Портрет его на стене с закрученными усами синьор Брини из Саммерхилла гутальянец папский зуав при Святейшем Отце покинул набережную и переселился на Моссстрит А кто он такой скажите на милость Да никто в третьем этаже комнатенка семь шиллингов в неделю окна во двор и разгуливал навешав себе на грудь какихто жестянок в знак вызова всему миру А почтовая открытка  продолжает ДжДж  означает огласку В прецедентном деле Сэдгрова против Хоула это признали достаточным доказательством злого умысла По моему мнению иск могут принятьОпять двадцать пять приехали Да кому оно надо твое мнение Дай нам спокойно пивка попить Ейей уже и этого не дадут Ваше здоровье Джек  говорит Нед И ваше Нед  это ДжДж А вот и опять он  говорит Джо Гдегде  спрашивает ОлфИ убей бог он снова плетется мимо дверей томищи оба под мышкой а рядом жена и Корни Келлехер тот зыркнул к нам проходя своим оловянным глазом а сам все время ему отечески втолковывает пытается всучить гробик бывший в употреблении А как там дело о канадском мошенничестве  Джо спрашивает Отложено  отвечает ДжДжЭто значит некто из крючконосой братии по имени Джеймс Воут он же Шапиро он же Спарк он же Спайро поместил в газетах что он любому желающему обеспечивает проезд в Канаду за двадцать шиллингов Чего Вы что меня за кретина считаете Нечего говорить это все был чистейший блеф Как вам это Всех околпачил не только разных служанок да мужичье из графства Мит но заодно уж и своих соплеменников ДжДж рассказывал там один древний иудей Зарецкий или как бишь его стоит на свидетельском месте не снявши шляпу льет слезы и клянется святым Моисеем что его накололи на два фунта А кто вел процесс  Джо спросил Главный судья  отвечает Нед Бедный старый сэр Фредерик  говорит Олф  его каждый младенец обведет вокруг пальца Большое сердце больше чем у слона  Нед за ним  Ему расскажут страшную сказку про долги за квартиру и про больную жену и кучу детей и убей бог он тут же разрыдается в своем кресле Точно  соглашается Олф  Рувиму Дж просто дьявольски повезло ему как пить дать полагалась кутузка за то что разорил Гамли бедняга теперь булыжники стережет возле Баттского мостаИ начинает передразнивать как этот старикан главный судья причитает Вовеки неслыханно Этот бедный труженик Сколько у вас детей Десять вы говорите Да ваша честь А у жены моей брюшной тиф И жена лежит с тифом Какой позор Извольте немедленно покинуть зал сэр Нет сэр я не вынесу постановления о взыскании И как вы посмели сэр явиться сюда с таким иском Бедный усердный труженик Я прекращаю делоИ был день шестнадцатый месяца волоокой богини и неделя третья по светлом празднике Троицы Единосущной и Нераздельной дочь же небес луна дева пребывала в своей первой четверти и вот свершилось что просвещенные судьи направились в чертоги закона И там магистр Кортни заседающий в своей палате представил свое суждение а судья магистр Эндрюс заседавший без присяжных в суде по наследственным делам со вниманием рассмотрел и взвесил права первого истца на имущество означенное в подлежащем утверждению завещании и в окончательном завещательном распоряжении касательно недвижимого и движимого имущества умершего Джекоба Холлидея виноторговца покойного против прав Ливингстона несовершеннолетнего душевнобольного и компаньона И вот под торжественные своды суда на Гринстрит вступил сэр Фредерик СокольничийИ воссел он там около пятого часу дабы вершить правосудие по законам брехонов в комиссии поставленной для всего того округа и для прилежащих и для графства города Дублин И восседал вкупе с ним великий синедрион двенадцати колен Иаровых по одному мужу от каждого из колен от колена Патрикова и от колена Хьюгова и от колена Оунова и от колена Коннова и от колена Оскарова и от колена Фергусова и от колена Финнова и от колена Дермотова и от колена Кормакова и от колена Кевинова и от колена Куилтова и от колена Оссианова и всего было их двенадцать мужей честных и праведных И он заклинал их Умершим на кресте дабы они судили здраво и справедливо и высказали справедливое суждение по делу их повелителя короля против подсудимого и вынесли бы справедливый вердикт в соответствии со всеми показаниями в чем да поможет им Бог и целуйте книгу И они встали на своих местах сии двенадцать Иаровых и поклялись именем Предвечного что будут править Его правый суд И тотчас блюстители закона привели из казематов замка того кого ищейки правосудия изловили следуя полученным сведениям И был он скован по рукам и ногам и они не отпускали его ни под залог ни на поруки но нашли нужным предать суду ибо был он злодей Милое дело получается  говорит Гражданин  Приезжают к нам в Ирландию всякие и клопов тут разводятТут Блум делает вид как будто ничего не слыхал и начинает говорить Джо что насчет той мелочи он может не беспокоиться до первого но вот если бы он замолвил словечко мистеру Кроуфорду А Джо ему клянется всеми святыми и на чем свет стоит что он для него в лепешку готов разбиться Потому что видите ли  объясняет Блум  для рекламы необходим повтор В этомто весь секрет Можете на меня положиться  Джо обещает Обманывают крестьян  гнет свое Гражданин  наживаются на ирландских бедняках Больше мы не желаем чужаков в нашем доме О я уверен все будет в порядке Хайнс  говорит Блум  Просто уж этот Ключчи понимаете Считайте что дело сделано  Джо ему Большая любезность с вашей стороны  благодарит Блум Чужаки  Гражданин свое  А виноваты мы сами Сами пустили их Сами сюда зазвали Эта прелюбодейка со своим полюбовником зазвали сюда англосаксов чтобы грабили нас Условное постановление  говорит ДжДжТеперь Блум притворяется будто со страшным интересом разглядывает неведомо что может паутину в углу Гражданин на него уставился с грозным видом а пес у него в ногах поднял морду глядит пора ли уже бросаться и на кого Опозоренная жена  заявляет Гражданин  вот где причина всех наших бедствий А вот как раз и она  говорит Олф они с Терри все хихикали у стойки над Полис газетт  во всей боевой раскраске Дайка и нам глянуть  говорюА у них там оказывается одна из тех похабных американских картинок которые Терри берет у Корни Келлехера Секрет как увеличить ваши интимные органы Шалости светской красавицы Норман ВТаппер богатый подрядчик из Чикаго находит свою прелестную но неверную жену в объятиях капитана Тэйлора Красавица в панталончиках предается шалостям кавалер ее трогает за места а Норман ВТаппер врывается со своим пугачом как раз когда она только что поиграла с капитаном Тэйлором в палочку и колечко Ах Дженни милочка  говорит Джо  не простудись без юбочки Есть за что подержаться Джо  я ему  Ты бы не прочь кус филея от этой телочки аТо да се а тем временем заходит Джон Уайз Нолан и за ним Ленехан у которого физиономия вытянулась до шестой пуговицы Нус  говорит Гражданин  изложите вести с театра событий Чего там эти сапожники из муниципалитета решили на своем сборище насчет ирландского языкаОНолан в сияющую броню одетый земным поклоном воздал должные почести великому и грозному и могучему владыке Эрина и поведал ему обо всем свершившемся как достойные старейшины смиреннейшего из градов второго во всем том царстве встретили их под сводами Фолсела и там вознеся подобающие молитвы богамнебожителям торжественный держали совет дабы решить надлежит ли им буде окажется то возможным возвеличить вновь среди смертных крылатую речь морями разъединенных кельтов Дело двигается  говорит Гражданин  К матери этих сукиных саксов и с их кваканьемНу тут ДжДж давай строить просвещенного барина и заправляет де мол возможны разные точки зрения и люди отворачиваются от фактов и вспомните прием Нельсона глядеть в трубу слепым глазом и можно ли обвинять огульно целую нацию а Блум ему вовсю подпевает про умеренность да похеренность да ихние колонии да ихнюю цивилизацию Сифилизация уж лучше сказать  гремит Гражданин  К матери их Да разрази их всех в три слоя с покрышкой этих тупых ублюдков Ни в музыке ни в литературе ни в живописи нигде у них ни хрена одни жалкие потугиВсе что у них из цивилизации  это у нас украдено Стадо гугнивых выродков Семья европейских народов  ОМоллой вякает Они никакие не европейцы  режет Гражданин  Я был в Европе с Кевином Игеном Парижским Нигде в Европе никакого следа ни их ни ихнего языка если только в  А Джон Уайз говорит Сколь многие цветы ничей не узрит взорА Ленехан который слегка может по этой фене      Сказал он и поднял своей большой заскорузлой и мощной дланью кубок крепкого темного пенистого эля и испустив боевой клич своего клана Лам Дерг Абу осушил его за победу над врагом над племенем могучих и отважных героев что правят морями и восседают на алебастровых тронах безмолвные словно бессмертные боги Чего это с тобой приключилось  я спрашиваю у Ленехана  У тебя вид как будто ты ждал триста а получил свиста Золотой кубок  отвечает Кто же выиграл мистер Ленехан  Терри спрашивает Реклама  тот отвечает  Выдача двадцать к одному Чистейший аутсайдер А все остальные с носом А Бассова кобылка  опять Терри Скоро доскачет  говорит Ленехан  Мы все накололись Бойлан по моему совету поставил на Корону два фунта за себя и за одну знакомую Я и сам полкроны поставил  говорит Терри  на Муската мне мистер Флинн подсказал Лорда Хауарда де Уолдена Двадцать к одному  повторяет Ленехан  Вот такая дерьмовая жизньРеклама  повторяет  Запудрила всем мозги и хапнула все печенье Корона тебе имя  вероломствоТут он подбирает жестянку от печенья что Боб Дорен оставил и смотрит нет ли там чем поживиться на шаромыжку а паршивая дворняга за ним глядит повезет ему или нет разинув свою поганую пасть Стала бабушка искать хочет кость собачке дать Шиш с маслом детка  тот ему Держи хвост морковкой  Джо утешает  Корона бы выиграла если б не эта сучкаА ДжДж с Гражданином все препираются насчет истории да законов и Блум уж конечно тоже суется Некоторые люди  говорит Блум  в чужом глазу увидят соринку а в собственном бревна не заметят   отвечает Гражданин  Не зря говорят слепому очков не подберешь Куда делись наши двадцать миллионов ирландцев которых мы должны бы иметь сейчас вместо четырех наши потерянные коленаА наши гончары наши ткани лучшие во всем мире А наши сукна их еще в Риме продавали во времена Ювенала и наш лен и камчатное полотно что ткут в Антриме и кружева из Лимерика и наши дубленые кожи и флинтглас изпод Баллибоха и гугенотский поплин который у нас еще со времен Жаккара из Лиона и наши тканые шелка и фоксфордский твид и кремовый гипюр из кармелитского монастыря в НьюРоссе ничего подобного во всем мире нет Где греческие купцы что проходили через Геркулесовы Столбы ныне Гибралтар захваченный врагом рода человеческого и плыли в Вексфорд на торжище Кармен торговать золотом и тирским пурпуром Почитайтека Тацита и Птолемея или хотя бы Гиральда Камбрийского Вино пушнина мрамор из Коннемары серебро из Типперери совершенно непревзойденное а лошади наши славятся и по сей день ирландская упряжная порода а за право ловить рыбу в наших водах король испанский Филипп готов был платить нам пошлинуКто вычислит сколько нам должен паршивый Джон Буль за нашу загубленную торговлю за наши разоренные хижины А русла Барроу и Шаннона они не желают их углублять они нам оставляют миллионы акров болот чтобы мы подыхали от чахотки Скоро у нас тут будет безлесье как в Португалии  вставляет Джон Уайз  или на какомнибудь Гельголанде где торчит одно деревце Если только не примутся за лесопосадки Ель лиственница все деревья что из семейства хвойных на глазах исчезают Я вот читал доклад лорда Кэслтауна Их надо срочно спасать  говорит Гражданин  и ясень гигантский в Голуэе и вяз

зеленого мерсеризованного шелка на чехле сумеречносерых тонов с широким изумруднозеленым поясом и тремя рядами оборок более темного оттенка а также в довершение ансамбля бретельками и каштановыми вытачками на бедрах Подружки невесты мисс Пиния и мисс Туя также из семейства Хвойнов были в необычайно идущих им к лицу туалетах тех же тонов с изящной розовой отделкой мотивы которой прихотливо повторялись в нефритовозеленых токах украшенных эгретками из бледнокоралловых перьев цапли Сеньор Энрике Флор восседавший за органом явил свое прославленное искусство и в дополнение к музыке предписанной венчальным каноном завершил службу исполнением песни Лесоруб лесоруб не руби ты этот дуб в замечательной новой аранжировкеКогда молодые получив папское благословение покидали церковь

Нолан уединенно проведут свой медовый месяц в Черном Лесу И мы смотрим на Европу  говорит Гражданин  Когда еще эти дворняжки были щенками мы уже торговали с Испанией и с французами и с голландцами испанские суда плавали в Голуэй с грузом от которого веселей с винцом по винноцветному морю И поплывут еще  говорит Джо И с помощью Пречистой Девы Марии еще поплывут  повторяет Гражданин трахая себя по ляжке  Наши опустевшие гавани опять оживут Куинстаун Кинсейл Голуэй Блэксодбэй Вентри что в графстве Керри Киллибегс третий по величине порт во всем мире целые леса мачт корабли рода Линчей из

храбрости  Ленехан отвечает Половинку с прицепом Терри  заказывает Джон Уайз  Эй ТерриНикак заснул Сию минуту сэр  отвечает Терри  Полпорции виски и бутылочку эляДаю сэрПрилип к этой вшивой газетке с Олфом выискивает там чего позабористей вместо того чтоб обслуживать Картинка матча в котором дерутся головами один другого старается трахнуть черепом идет на него пригнув голову как бык на стенку Еще картинка Так сожгли черную скотину в Омахе Джорджия Орава героев в ковбойских шляпах до глаз палит в черномазого повешенного на дереве у того уже язык наружу а внизу разложен костерЕй ей им бы еще утопить его в море посадить на электрический стул и распять чтобы уж были уверены в успехе А как же непобедимый флот  спрашивает Нед  гроза всех врагов Я вам про это коечто расскажу  говорит Гражданин  Это сущий ад на земле Почитайтека в газетах про то как избивают палками на учебных судах в Портсмуте Какойто тип пишет за подписью ВозмущенныйИ давай нам рассказывать про телесные наказания как выстраивается команда и офицеры и адмирал тут же в треуголке и пастор со своей протестантской библией словом все чтоб присутствовать при наказанииПриводят беднягу паренька который вопит благим матом растягивают на лафете орудия привязывают Отбивную и дюжину горячительного  говорит Гражданин  так это дело называл старый бандит сэр Джон Бересфорд ну а теперешние Кромвели это прозвали морской обычайДжон Уайз вставляет Обычай что достойней уничтожить чем сохранятьА тот дальше рассказывает как там выходит судовой инструктор с длинной тростью размахивается и пошел сдирать шкуру с бедного малого пока тот не наорется до хрипоты убивают Вот вам славный британский флот  говорит Гражданин  который властвует над землей Эти герои что никогда не будут рабами у них единственная наследственная палата на всем Божьем свете а все земли в руках у дюжины надутых баронов да боровов ни в чем не смыслящих кроме псовой охоты Вот она их великая империя которой они так бахвалятся  империя рабов замордованных и трудом и кнутом Над которой никогда не восходит солнце  вставляет Джо И вся трагедия в том  продолжает Гражданин  что сами они в это верят Несчастные йеху в это верятВеруют во кнутаотца шкуродера и творца ада на земле и в ДжекаМатроса сына прохожего его же зачала Мэришлюха от несытого брюха рожденного для королевского флота страдавшего под отбивною и дюжиной горячительного бичеванного измордованного и завывавшего аки зверь и восставшего с койки на третий день по предписаниям и пришедшего в порт и воссевшего на своей драной заднице покуда не отдадут приказ и не потрюхает он опять вкалывать ради куска хлеба Но ведь разве  ввязывается Блум  дисциплина не везде одинакова Я хочу сказать разве у вас не было бы то же самое если бы вы против силы выставили свою силуНу что я вам говорил Не пить мне этого портера если он и до последнего издыхания не будет вам доказывать что черное это белое Мы выставим силу против силы  говорит Гражданин  У нас есть великая Ирландия за океа Их выгнали из родного дома и родной страны в черном сорок седьмом году Их глинобитные лачуги и придорожные хижины сровняли с землей а в Таймсе радостно возвещали трусливым саксам что скоро в Ирландии останется не больше ирландцев чем краснокожих в АмерикеПаша турецкий и тот прислал нам какието пиастры Но саксы нарочно старались задушить голодом нацию и хоть земля уродила вдосталь британские гиены подчистую скупали все и продавали в РиодеЖанейроКрестьян наших они гнали толпами Двадцать тысяч из них распростились с жизнью на борту плавучих гробов Но те что достигли земли свободных не позабыли земли рабства Они еще вернутся и отомстят это вам не мокрые курицы сыны Гранунл заступники КетлинниХулихан Совершенно справедливо  снова Блум за свое  но ято имел в виду Да мы уж давно этого ждем Гражданин  Нед вставляет  Еще с тех пор как бедная старушка нам говорила что французы у наших берегов с тех пор как они высаживались в Киллале Верно  говорит Джон Уайз  Мы сражались за Стюартов а они предали нас с головой выдали вильямитам А вспомните Лимерик и нарушение договора на камне Наши лучшие люди проливали кровь за Францию и Испанию дикие гуси Одна битва при Фонтенуа чего стоит А Сарсфилд а ОДоннелл герцог Тетуанский в Испании а Улисс Браун из Камуса фельдмаршал в войсках Марии Терезии Но что мы хоть когданибудь получили за это Французы  фыркает Гражданин  Компашка учителей танцев Как будто сами не знаете Для Ирландии цена им всегда была грош ломаный А нынче они из кожи лезут устраивают   с коварным Альбионом вроде обедов Тэй Пэя Первые смутьяны Европы и всегда ими были     говорит Ленехан прибирая к рукам кружечку пива А взять пруссаков и ганноверцев  Джо поддакивает  мало что ли у нас сидело этих бастардовколбасников на троне от курфюрста Георга до этого немчика и старой суки со вспученным брюхом что околела недавноИ убей бог мы все там полегли со смеху как он изобразил нам про эту старушку Вик в розовых очках мол что ни вечер она в своем королевском дворце глушит нектар и амброзию кувшинами а как упьется до поросячьего визга тут ее кучер загребает в охапку и плюхает как мешок в постель а она его дергает за баки да распевает допотопные песенки про Эрен на Рейне и приди туда где выпивка дешевле Ну что ж  говорит ДжДж  Зато теперь у нас Эдуардмиротворец Сказки для дураков  ему Гражданин на это  У этого кобеля заботы  не мир наводить а триппер не подхватить Эдуард ГвельфВеттин А что вы скажете  Джо ярится  про этих святош ирландских попов и епископов которые разукрасили его покои в Мануте скаковыми эмблемами его Поганского то бишь Британского Величества да картинками всех лошадей на которых его жокеи ездят Как же граф Дублинский Туда б еще картинки всех баб на которых он сам поездил  предлагает малыш ОлфНа это ДжДж солидно Их преосвященства были вынуждены отказаться от этой идеи за недостатком места Еще одну сделаешь Гражданин  Джо спрашивает О да сэр  тот ему Ну а ты  это Джо мне Бесконечно признателен  отвечаю  И дай тебе бог всяческого прибытку Все то же повторить  Джо заказываетА Блум в своем чернорыжегрязноболотном котелке на макушке все мелет и мелет языком с Джоном Уайзом входит в раж глаза выкатил что сливы Преследования  говорит  вся мировая история полна ими Разжигают ненависть между нациями А вы знаете что это такое нация  спрашивает Джон Уайз Да  отвечает Блум И что же это  тот ему снова Нация  Блум говорит  Нация это все люди живущие в одном месте Ну уморил  смеется тут Нед  Раз так тогда нация это я я уже целых пять лет живу в одном местеТут конечно все Блума на смех а он пробует выпутаться Или возможно живущие в разных местах Под это я подхожу  говорит Джо А нельзя ли спросить какова ваша нация  Гражданин вежливенько Ирландская  отвечает Блум  Здесь я родился ИрландияГражданин на это ничего не сказал но только выдал из пасти такой плевок что дай бог добрую устрицу с Редбэнк отхаркнул аж в дальний угол Ну как поехали Джо  говорит он и вынимает платок чтобы утереться Поехали Гражданин  тот ему  Возьмите это в правую руку и повторяйте за мной следующие словаДревняя и бесценная покрытая хитроумной вышивкой ирландская лицевая пелена которую предание связывает с именами Соломона из Дромы и Мануса ТомалтахаогМакДоноха авторов Книги Баллимот была с величайшими предосторожностями извлечена на свет и вызвала благоговейное восхищениеИзбегнем пространных описаний прославленной красоты ее четырех углов из коих каждый  верх совершенства скажем лишь что на них можно было отчетливо различить четырех евангелистов вверяющих четырем мастерам свои евангельские символы скипетр мореного дуба североамериканскую пуму заметим вскользь что это не в пример более благородный царь зверей нежели объект британской геральдики тельца из Керри и золотого орла с Каррантухилла Виды же заполняющие сморкательное поле изображали наши древние дуны раты кромлехи и гриноны а также обители просвещения и каменные пирамиды слагаемые в память о бедствиях и были столь же прекрасны а краски их столь же

Какая тут чья Вот это мое  говорит Джо  как сказал черт мертвому полисмену И еще я принадлежу к племени  заявляет Блум  которое ненавидят и преследуют Причем и поныне Вот в этот день Вот в эту минутуБог ты мой а окурок сигары ему совсем уже пальцы жжет Грабят  говорит он  Обирают Оскорбляют Преследуют Отнимают то что наше по праву Вот в эту самую минуту  говорит он и поднимает кулак  продают на рынке в Марокко как рабов как скот Вы что ли говорите про новый Иерусалим  Гражданин спрашивает Я говорю про несправедливость  отвечает Блум Хорошо  говорит Джон Уайз  Но тогда сопротивляйтесь проявите силу как подобает мужчинамУж это будет незабываемая картинка Мишень для разрывной пули Старая жирная морда перед дулами пушек Вот швабру он бы собой украсил отлично только обряди его в фартук с завязочками А потом вдруг в один миг у него душа в пятки и он уже накручивает все другое наоборот жалкий слабак тряпка Но все это бесполезно  отвечает он  Сила ненависть история все эти штуки Оскорбления и ненависть  это не жизнь для человека Всякий знает что истинная жизнь  это совершенно противоположное И что же  Олф его спрашивает Любовь  отвечает Блум  Я имею в виду противоположное ненавистиМне надо сейчас идти  это он Джону Уайзу  Тут рядом заглянуть на минутку в суд нет ли там Мартина Если он придет скажите ему пожалуйста что я скоро вернусь Я на одну минутуДа кто тебя держитто И выскакивает как жирная молния Новый апостол язычников  бурчит Гражданин  Всеобщая любовь А что  говорит Джон Уайз  разве это не то же что нам твердятВозлюби ближнего своего Кто

Мария и Патрик да будут с вами  говорит ГражданинИ опрокидывает свою кружку чтоб промочить пасть Знаем мы эти басни  говорит он  Читает благие проповеди а сам в карман к тебе лезет Как там богомольный Кромвель и его железнобокие что вырезали всех женщин и детей в Дрогеде а на пушках у них вокруг дул было написано из библии Бог есть любовь Библия Не читали в сегодняшнем Юнайтед айришмен фельетон про визит зулусского вождя в Англию Нет а что там  Джо спрашиваетГражданин вытаскивает из своего личного архива номер газеты и принимается нам читать Делегация крупнейших хлопковых магнатов Манчестера была вчера представлена Его Величеству Алаки Абеакутскому дежурным Главой Протокола лордом Процедуром из ПроцедурынаПустомМесте дабы выразить Его Величеству горячую благодарность английских коммерсантов за привилегии данные им в его владениях Члены делегации присутствовали на завтраке в заключение которого темнокожий властитель произнес яркую речь вольно переводившуюся британским капелланом преподобным Ананией Богомолом Барбоном В ней он выразил благодарность массе Процедуру и подчеркнул сердечность отношений существующих между Абеакутой и Британской Империей заявив что величайшей драгоценностью для него является иллюстрированная библия книга в которой слово Божие и секрет могущества Англии благосклонно подаренная ему предводительницей белых великою скво Викторией с личною надписью Августейшей Дарительницы На этом владыка Алаки провозгласив тост Черное и Белое осушил чашу дружбы полную первосортного ирландского виски из черепа своего прямого предшественника на троне династии Какачакачаков носившего прозвище Сорок Чирьев Затем он осмотрел крупнейшую из фабрик Хлопкополиса и поставил свой крест в книге посетителей исполнив при этом древний и очаровательный абеакутский военный танец во время которого он проглотил множество ножей и вилок поощряемый радостными рукоплесканиями юных работниц Царственная вдовица  говорит Нед  выше всякого подозрения Но интересно не использовал ли он эту библию так же как я бы на его месте Так же и даже еще лучше  Ленехан уверяет  Ибо потом на той плодородной земле выросло пышное манговое дерево с широкими листьями А кто написал Гриффит  спрашивает Джон Уайз Да нет  отвечает Гражданин  Там не подписано Шангана Стоит только инициал П Что же отличный инициал  говорит Джо Так вот они и действуют  говорит Гражданин  Торговля следует за флагом Да  замечает ДжДж  если они ведут себя не лучше бельгийцев в Конго хорошенькая там жизнь Вы не читали этот доклад кто же его написал Кейсмент  подсказывает Гражданин  Он кстати ирландец Дада он самый  продолжает ДжДж  Насилуют женщин девушек молотят туземцев по животам видно чтоб выжать из них весь красный каучук какой можно Знаю куда он пошел  вдруг говорит Ленехан и щелкает пальцами Кто  спрашиваю Блум  отвечает он  Это все липа насчет суда А он ставил на Рекламу и побежал сейчас загребать сребреники Чего этот белоглазый кафр  Гражданин не верит  Да он в жизни на лошадь не поставит даже со злости Нет он туда пошел  твердит свое Ленехан  Я тут встретил Бэнтама Лайонса он как раз на эту лошадку хотел ставить только изза меня раздумал и он сказал мне это Блум ему подкинул намек На что хочешь бьюсь об заклад он сейчас загребает сто шиллингов на свои пять Единственный во всем Дублине кто сорвал куш Поставил на темную лошадку Сам он чертова темная лошадка  ворчит Джо Пропустика Джо  говорю  Где у нас тут вход на выход Туда вон  кивает ТерриПрощай Ирландия я еду в Горт Значит выхожу я на задворки отлить и убей бог сто шиллингов на пять пока я там выпускал свой Рекламато взяла двадцать к пока выпускал свой заряд я себе говорю я ж замечал ейей что его две пинты от Джо и у Слэттри одна его так и тянет кудато смыться сто шиллингов это же пять фунтов а когда они жили в темная лошадка Сикун рассказывал как бывало сидят за картами а они представляются будто ребенок болен ну сила не меньше галлона напрудил и эта его вислозадая половина сообщает по внутреннему телефону мол ей лучше или там ей ох весь план к тому чтоб он мог смыться в выгодную минуту с выигрышем а еще как пузырьто не лопнул торгует без патента ох Ирландия говорит моя нация перр пукпукпук нет уж их не переплюнешь этих чертовых ага последний остаток иерусалимских уф рогачейОдним словом я возвращаюсь а они все долдонят и Джон Уайз рассказывает это мол Блум подал идею шиннфейнерам чтобы Гриффит в своей газете разоблачал всяческие махинации подтасовки состава присяжных или там жульничества с налогами и чтобы по всем странам посылали своих представителей продвигать торговлю ирландскими товарами Менять шило на мыло Тут уж я скажу вам густой мрачок если эта косоглазая рожа еще нам примется устраивать наши дела Уж дайте нам понашему сдохнуть Боже спаси Ирландию от этого жирного пройдохи и всех подобных ему Мистер Блум и его шахермахеры А до него еще его папаша занимался мошенничеством старый Мафусаил Блум бизнесмен с большой дороги отравился синильной кислотой но только прежде всю страну завалил своим хламом брильянтами на пенни пара Ссуды по почте на удобных условиях Любые суммы высылаются на основании расписки Расстояние не ограничивается Гарантий не требуетсяНи дать ни взять собачка Ланти Макхейла что каждому хвостиком виляет Это истинный факт  говорит Джон Уайз  И вот вам человек который про это может все рассказать Мартин КаннингемИ точно подкатывает муниципальный кэб а в нем Мартин Джек Пауэр и еще один тип Крофтер то ли Крофтон оранжист получает пенсию от таможенного ведомства и при Блэкберне состоит где ему платят за то  или может Кроуфорд  что он шляется по всей стране за казенный счетНаши путники достигли постоялого двора и спешились на землю со своих скакунов Гей слуги  вскричал один из прибывших чья осанка тотчас изобличала предводителя  Ленивые прохвосты СюдаИ с этими словами он шумно принялся колотить рукояткою меча по открытой оконной решеткеНа сей призыв немедля появился хозяин на ходу подпоясывая свой плащ Добрый вам вечер милостивые господа  проговорил он угодливо кланяясь Живей пошевеливайся бездельник  вскричал ему стучавший в окно  Вели позаботиться о наших конях А нам подай лучшего что только найдется в твоей дыре ибо клянусь добрый ужин не повредил бы нашим желудкам Увы добрые господа  отвечал ему на это хозяин  В моем нищем доме и в погребе и в кладовке хоть шаром покати Право совсем не знаю что и предложить вашим милостям Что это ты там мелешь  вскричал при этих словах второй из прибывших человек с весьма приятными и живыми чертами лица  Такто ты принимаешь королевских гонцов толстопузый мошенникЛицо хозяина изменилось во мгновение ока Прошу вас смилуйтесь благородные рыцари  смиренно взмолился он  Коль скоро вы гонцы нашего короля да оградит бог Его Величество у вас не будет нужды ни в чем Клянусь друзьям короля да благословит бог Его Величество не придется поститься в моем доме Так живо принимайся за дело  воскликнул прежде молчавший путник в ком вся наружность выдавала любителя хорошо поесть  Чего там у тебя найдется для насВновь низко кланяясь хозяин ему отвечал Не окажете ли вы честь достойнейшие рыцари моим паштетам из молодых голубей бифштексам из оленины седлу теленка утке зажаренной с румяным беконом кабаньей голове с фисташками чаше сладкого заварного крема пудингу с рябиновым соком и кувшину старого рейнского Гром и молния  вскричал вопрошавший  Вот это по мне Фисташки Ага  рассмеялся путник с приятными чертами лица  Нечего сказать нищий дом и пустая кладовка Он славный шутник этот негодяйСтало быть входит Мартин и спрашивает где Блум Где ему быть  отвечает Ленехан  Обирает вдов и сирот Правда это или нет  спрашивает Джон Уайз  то что я рассказывал Гражданину про Блума и его связи с Шинн Фейн Да это правда  говорит Мартин  или по крайней мере так про него наушничают Это кто же наушничает  спрашивает Олф Я  отвечает Джо  У меня шапка с наушниками Но в конце концов  рассуждает Джон Уайз  почему еврей не может любить свою родину точно так же как и всякий другой Отчего бы нет  ДжДж на это ему  Если только он знает где его родина Он что еврей или же он язычник или католик или методист или черт дери еще чтото  Нед спрашивает  Кто он такой вообще Я вам не в обиду Крофтон Мы его не желаем  говорит Крофтер оранжист или пресвитерианец Кто такой Джуниус  говорит ДжДж Он  отпавший еврей  объясняет Мартин  родом откудато из Венгрии и это именно он придумал все планы насчет венгерской системы У нас в муниципалитете про это знают А он не родственник дантиста Блума  спрашивает Джек Пауэр Нет просто однофамильцы  Мартин ему  Его настоящая фамилия Вираг Фамилия отца его который отравился Он получил разрешение сменить фамилию то есть не он а еще отец Тоже мне новый мессия для Ирландии  говорит Гражданин  Остров мудрецов и святых Что же они все еще ждут своего искупителя  говорит Мартин  В этом смысле и мы как они Верно  продолжает ДжДж  и про каждого новорожденного мужского пола они думают что этот может и есть мессия Так что у них надо полагать каждый еврей себе места не находит пока не узнает кем стал отцом или матерью Ждет что ему вотвот малец  добавляет Ленехан Мать честная  вспоминает тут Нед  видели бы вы Блума перед тем как у него сын родился тот что умер потом Помню я его встретил на южном рынке он там покупал детское писание а делото еще было за полтора месяца до родов       говорит ДжДж И это повашему мужчина  Гражданин спрашивает Интересно он хоть разок сумел вообще задвинуть  говорит Джо Ну какникак двое детей народилось  Джек Пауэр на это И кого ж он подозревает  спрашивает ГражданинЕй ей в каждой шутке есть доля правды Ни то ни се сущий гермафродит вот он кто Сикун говорит в этом своем отеле он что ни месяц регулярно в постель головные боли как есть тебе баба с женским делом Да знаете что я скажу если на то пошло Одна бы польза была если б ухватить вот такого вот недоноска за шкирку да и шарахнуть в море к едрене Фанни Оправданная мера самозащиты А что скажете это почеловечески огрести даровых пять фунтов и смыться не поставивши людям хоть по единой пинте Эх господи благослови Да тут не будет и блоху утопить Вспомним про милосердие к ближним  Мартин советует  Но только где же он сам Нам некогда дожидаться Волк в овечьей шкуре вот он кто есть  говорит Гражданин  Вираг из Венгрии Агасфер я бы его назвал Проклятый богом А у вас найдется минутка для краткого возлияния Мартин  Нед спрашивает Если только одну  отвечает тот  Мы спешим уже Порцию Джейджейси А вы Джек Крофтон Значит три половинки Терри Святому Патрику надо бы снова высадиться в Балликинларе и взяться за наше обращение  Гражданин заявляет  после того как мы позволили вот таким запаскудить нашу страну Ну будем  говорит Мартин и тянется поторапливаясь за своей кружкой  Всем тут присутствующим да окажет бог свою милость Аминь  заключает Гражданин Окажетокажет не сомневайтесь  это ДжоИ под звуки освященного колокольчика во главе с несущим распятие за коим следовали псаломщики кадилоносцы ковчеженосцы чтецы привратники

                                  Мы все такого же мнения  говорит Джек Долгих вам лет Лэмберт  говорит этот Крофтон или Кроуфорд Не против  отвечает Нед поднимая стаканчик виски  Пилось бы да елосьЯ поглядываю по сторонам не придет ли комунибудь счастливая мысль и тут проклятье опять он является с таким видом как будто спешил со всех ног А я  говорит  только что был в суде вас искал Надеюсь я не

жиды Один профит знают Нюх как у крысы в нужнике Сто на пять Никому не рассказывай  говорит Гражданин Прошу прощения  Блум ему Пойдемте пойдемте  торопит Мартин видя что пахнет жареным  Пора двигаться Никому не рассказывай  Гражданин повторяет и аж рычит от полноты чувства  Держи в секретеПсина тут просыпается и тоже издает рык Ну мы пошли пока  Мартин говоритИ поживей их выталкивает наружу Джека

лучи братья один другому и огибая их ободом и быстроту сообщая стопам мужей спешат ли они на грозную сечу или состязаются ради улыбки прекрасных дам И так приплывая располагались они нимфы благосклонные бессмертные сестры И смеялись резвясь в клубах белопенных и резво взрезала волны ладьяНо тут не успел я приземлить кружку на стол как вижу Гражданин подымается и прет шатаясь к дверям

мгновенной и ужасающей по своим последствиямОбсерватория в Дансинке зарегистрировала общим счетом одиннадцать толчков каждый из них силой в пять баллов по шкале Меркалли и сейсмических потрясений подобной силы не было отмечено на нашем острове с  года даты восстания Шелкового Томаса По всей видимости эпицентр находился в той части столицы которая охватывает квартал Иннкуэй и приход свМичена занимая площадь сорок один акр два руда и один квадратный перч Роскошные резиденции расположенные в окрестности Дворца Правосудия все были разрушены а сам благородный чертог где в момент катастрофы происходили важные юридические дебаты превратился буквально в груду развалин под коими как можно опасаться все находившиеся в здании оказались погребены заживо Как явствует из свидетельств очевидцев сейсмические волны сопровождались также сильнейшими атмосферными возмущениями носившими характер циклона Головной убор принадлежавший как было позднее установлено достопочтенному секретарю

очевидцев одновременно можно было наблюдать как неизвестное тело необычайно крупных размеров раскаленное добела с невероятною скоростью пронеслось в атмосфере описав сложную траекторию пролегавшую в направлении западюгозапад Выражения соболезнования и сочувствия поступали ежечасно со всех концов мира и его святейшество папа милостиво и благосклонно повелел дабы во всех кафедральных соборах всех

Бог сотворил Скажете нет Убей бог спас И вдогонку как из ушата густая ругань Угробил я его или как  спрашиваетИ как заорет своему вшивому псу Ату его ату Гарри Ату милокИ что напоследок видим это кэб

даже и самого Его бен Блума Илию посреди сонмов ангельских возносящегося к сиянию славы под углом сорок пять градусов над пивной Доноху на Малой Гринстрит как ком навоза с лопатыЭпизод Летний вечер уж начинал окутывать мир своей таинственной поволокойСолнце клонилось к западу и последние лучи увы столь быстротечного дня нежно медлили на прощанье лаская гладь моря и песчаного пляжа и гордый выступ старого Хоута верно и вечно стерегущего воды залива и скалы вдоль берега Сэндимаунта затянутые морской тиной и наконец что всего важней скромную церковку откуда в вечерней тишине плыли звуки молитв обращенных к той которая чистым своим сиянием как вечный маяк светит людским сердцам носимым по житейскому морю  к Марии Звезде МорейТри девушки три подруги сидели на прибрежных скалах наслаждаясь чудесным вечером и морским ветерком несущим приятную еще не холодящую свежесть Уж сколько раз забирались они сюда в свое излюбленное местечко чтобы уютно потолковать под плеск искрящихся волн и обсудить разные девичьи дела  Сисси Кэффри и Эди Бордмен с младенцем в колясочке а также Томми и Джеки Кэффри два кудрявых мальчугана в матросках и матросских шапочках на которых было написано одно и то же название КЕВБеллайл Ибо Томми и Джеки Кэффри были близнецы какихнибудь четырех лет от роду большие шалуны и озорники но при всем том очень милые и забавные мальчуганы с живыми веселыми мордашками Они возились в песке со своими лопатками и ведерками строили башни как все детишки играли в большой разноцветный мячик и счастью их не было границ Эди Бордмен меж тем укачивала в колясочке пухлощекого малыша и юный джентльмен блаженно посапывал Ему было всего одиннадцать месяцев и девять дней совсем еще ползунок но он уже понемножку лепетал первые подобия слов Сисси Кэффри наклонилась над ним чтобы пощекотать складочки на его пухленьком животике и крохотную ямочку на подбородке А нука детка  улыбнулась она ему  скажи громкогромко дайте мне водичкиИ он лепетал за ней Ати ати дидиСисси Кэффри нежно потормошила малютку потому что она обожала детишек терпеливее всех возилась с захворавшими крошками и ни за что на свете нельзя было заставить Томми Кэффри принять касторку если ктото вместо Сисси попробует его взять за носик и посулить ему лакомую горбушку черного хлеба с патокой Эта девушка так умела уговаривать Но можно ручаться малютка Бордмен и вправду был очень мил сущий херувимчик в слюнявчике А Сисси Кэффри была вовсе не из породы спесивых красоток вроде Флоры Макфлимси Получив от природы в дар золотое сердце большие цыганские глаза с вечной смешинкой в них и губки подобные спелым вишням она неудержимо привлекала к себе И Эди Бордмен вместе с нею смеялась лепету своего крошечного братишкиНо тут юный Томми и юный Джеки устроили между собой легкую перепалкуМальчишки  всегда мальчишки и наши близнецы нисколько не были исключением из этого бесспорного правила Яблоком раздора явилась песочная крепость которую выстроил юный Джеки а юный Томми полагая что лучшее  враг хорошего стремился внести в нее архитектурные усовершенствования в виде большого входа такого как в башне Мартелло Томми был упорен однако и Джеки был волевой натурой и верный старому изречению что для каждого маленького ирландца его дом  его крепость он ринулся на презренного соперника с таким пылом что незадачливый узурпатор был вмиг повержен а с ним  как то ни печально  и сам предмет спора крепостьНужно ли говорить что вопли побежденного Томми достигли бдительного слуха подруг Томми нука поди сюда  строго окликнула его сестра  Скорейскорей А ты Джеки как не стыдно зачем ты его повалил на грязный песок бедняжку Вот погоди я тебе всыплю за этоЮный Томми с глазами полными слез явился на ее зов потому что слово старшей сестры было законом для близнецов После пережитого злоключения он был в плачевном виде Матроска и штанишки были у него сплошь в песке но Сисси издавна владела искусством справляться с маленькими житейскими неприятностями и уже через миг на его ладном костюмчике не осталось ни единой песчинки Однако в голубых глазах еще стояли большие слезы готовые излиться наружу и поэтому она крепко поцеловала его чтобы бобо прошло и погрозила пальцем нехорошему Джеки и сказала что она еще задаст ему и негодующе на него посмотрела Противный озорник Джеки  воскликнула онаПотом привлекла к себе маленького моряка и доверительно тихонько спросила А ты у нас кто Ты у нас деткаконфетка Скажика нам  вмешалась тут Эди Бордмен  а кого ты больше всех любишь Ты Сисси больше всех любишь Нее  протянул хныча Томми Тогда значит Эди  спросила Сисси Нее  тянул Томми А я знаю  сказала Эди без особого ликования и ее близорукие глаза бросили хитрый взгляд  Знаю кого Томми больше всех любит он Герти любит Нее  тянул Томми явно готовясь зареветьНо Сисси быстрым материнским чутьем живо угадала что тут неладно и шепнула Эди чтобы та отвела его за колясочку где джентльмен не увидит и присмотрела чтобы он не замочил свои новые желтые башмачкиНо кто же такая ГертиГерти Макдауэлл сидела невдалеке от своих подруг задумавшись и глядя кудато вдаль Самому пылкому воображению было бы не под силу нарисовать более прелестный образ ирландской девушки Все знакомые в один голос объявляли ее красавицей хотя и замечали порой что она пошла больше в Гилтрапов чем в Макдауэллов У нее была изящная тоненькая фигурка даже пожалуй хрупкая хотя таблетки с железом которые она начала принимать весьма помогали ей в отличие от пилюль Вдовы Велч уменьшая те истечения что раньше случались у нее и снимая чувство разбитостиВосковая бледность ее лица обладавшего чистотою слоновой кости была почти неземной однако губки в своем античном совершенстве заставляли вспомнить розовый бутон и лук Купидона Ее руки с тонкими пальцами были словно из мрамора пронизанного голубыми жилками и такой белизны какую только могли доставить лимонный сок и Крем Королевы хотя это была злейшая выдумка будто бы она надевала на ночь лайковые перчатки и мыла в молоке ноги Однажды Берта Сапл наговорила это про нее Эди Бордмен но она просто сочинила потому что в то время была с Герти на ножах конечно и у наших подружек иногда случались свои маленькие размолвки как у всех смертных и еще она ей сказала чтобы та ни за что на свете не проговорилась кто ей рассказал а иначе она всю жизнь не будет с ней разговаривать Нет ужКаждому по заслугам У Герти была врожденная утонченность некая томная  даже нечто царственное в том не оставляли сомнений изящные линии ее рук и ножка с высоким подъемом И если бы только ей выпал благой удел родиться в знатной семье и получить тонкое воспитание Герти Макдауэлл без труда могла бы сравняться с любою из самых блестящих дам всей страны и увидеть себя в роскошном уборе с диадемой на лбу и сонмы высокородных поклонников ревниво оспаривали бы честь оказаться у ее ног Может статься именно это возможная и несбывшаяся любовь и было тому причиной что ее нежные черты порой обретали какоето напряженное выражение исполненное тайного смысла и ее дивные глаза туманились странной грустью перед обаянием которой никто не мог устоятьОткуда их колдовская сила у женских глаз У Герти они светились лазурнейшей ирландской лазурью оттеняясь лучистыми ресницами и темными выразительными бровями Однако некогда эти брови не были столь обольстительно шелковисты Это мадам Вера Верайти со страниц своего Уголка Красоты в Новостях принцессы впервые дала ей совет попробовать краску для бровей придающую вашему взгляду то загадочное выражение что так нас чарует у цариц моды  и Герти приняв совет никогда не сожалела об этом Потом там еще было научное средство как перестать краснеть и каждая может стать высокой увеличьте ваш рост и ваше лицо прекрасно но как же носик Последнее пригодилось бы миссис Дигнам у той просто кнопка Но главною славой Герти были ее роскошные волосыТемно каштановые слегка вьющиеся от природы Она подрезала их как раз в то утро по случаю новолуния и они мириадами блестящих завитков обрамляли ее хорошенькую головку Она подрезала заодно и ногти это в четверг к богатству И сейчас когда от слов Эди ее щеки зажглись румянцем легким и нежным как лепестки роз она была столь прелестна в своей милой девичьей застенчивости что можно смело ручаться во всей богохранимой стране Ирландии ей бы не нашлось равнойОдно мгновение она еще сидела молча грустно опустив взор Она собиралась ответить но чтото удержало слова готовые сорваться с уст Ее тянуло заговорить однако достоинство ей подсказывало хранить молчаниеХорошенькие губки слегка надулись но тут же она подняла глаза и рассмеялась веселым смехом свежим как юное утро мая Она отлично знала уж кому знать почему эта косоглазая Эди сказала так потому что он с виду охладел к ней хотя на самом деле это было как милые бранятся Как это всегда бывает койкто себе места не находил что этот парень у которого велосипед постоянно разъезжает у Герти под окнами Но просто сейчас отец велел ему сидеть дома по вечерам и как следует заниматься чтобы заработать награду на экзаменах а потом после школы он хотел поступать в колледж Тринити учиться на доктора как и его брат УИУайли который выступал на университетских велогонках Быть может его не оченьто занимало что она чувствует и он даже не подозревал какая пустота и боль охватывали порой ее сердце пронзая его до глубины Но он был еще совсем юн и как знать со временем мог бы научиться ее любить Он был из протестантской семьи а Герти конечно знала Кто шел первым и за Ним  Пресвятая Дева и дальше святой Иосиф Но у него была эффектная внешность это бесспорно красивый правильный нос и потом он был настоящим джентльменом во всем до самых кончиков ногтей уже форма головы выдавала чтото незаурядное она всегда отличила бы и особенно заметно сзади когда он без шапки и потом он так ловко не держась за руль разворачивал свой велосипед у фонарного столба и его дорогие сигареты так хорошо пахли и еще они очень подходили друг другу по росту и вот потому Эди Бордмен и думала что она такая умная потому что перед ее жалким садиком он чтото не собирался разъезжатьОдета была Герти просто но с безошибочным вкусом каким владеют верные слуги Ее Величества Моды потому что у нее было такое чувство как будто есть крохотный шанс сегодня встретить его Изящная блузка цвета электрик которую она сама покрасила лучшей патентованной краской когда Дамский Иллюстрированный предсказал что электрик скоро войдет в моду с эффектным узким вырезом до ложбинки и с кармашком для платка но платок портил бы линию и Герти всегда там держала ватку надушенную своими любимыми духами и темноголубая расклешенная юбка длиной три четверти чудесно обрисовывали ее гибкую грациозную фигурку На ней была премиленькая кокетливая шляпка из черной соломки крупного плетения контрастно окаймленная понизу синей и канареечной синелью а сбоку украшенная бантиком тех же цветов За этим сочетанием синели она охотилась в прошлый вторник целых полдня пока наконец не нашла на летней распродаже у Клери в точности то что нужно шнур успел в магазине чуточку залосниться но на вид совершенно незаметно по два шиллинга один пенс за локоть Потом она это все приладила своими руками и сколько радости было когда она впервые примерила ее и улыбнулась прелестному отражению которое увидела в зеркальце И натягивая ее на большую кружку чтобы не потеряла формы она уже твердо знала что скоро некоторым знакомым придется сбавить свой гонор Ее туфельки были последней новинкой моды Эди Бордмен страшно гордилась что у нее совсем  но такой ножки как у Герти тридцать третьего у ней не было и не будет сколько свет простоит с носками из натуральной кожи и с единственной очень эффектной пряжкой на высоком изогнутом подъеме Ее юбка открывала точеные щиколотки безупречной формы а стройные икры обтянутые тонким чулком с уплотненной пяткой и широкими отворотами для подвязок виднелись ровно настолько насколько следует Что же до белья то о нем Герти заботилась больше всего и у кого из тех кому ведомы трепетные надежды и опасения нежных семнадцати лет хотя своим семнадцати Герти уже сказала прости достанет жестокосердия ее упрекнуть в этом У нее были четыре фасонных гарнитура с дивной кружевной отделкой каждый из трех предметов плюс ночная сорочка и причем ленточки у всех разного цвета розового голубого сиреневого и салатного и когда получала из прачечной она всегда их сама просушивала и подсинивала и гладила у нее такой был кирпичик на чем ставить утюг потому что этим прачкам она нисколько не доверяла насмотревшись как они портят вещи Она надела голубое на счастье надеясь наперекор всему это был ее цвет и еще это счастливый цвет для невесты если на ней есть гденибудь голубое потому что когда она надела в тот день зеленое то вышло к несчастью потому что отец засадил его дома заниматься ради этой награды и потому что она подумала может быть сегодня он всетаки выйдет потому что когда она одевалась утром она чуть было не надела эти старенькие наизнанку а это как раз к счастью и к встрече любящих если ты это наденешь наизнанку только чтобы день был не пятницаИ однако однако Это напряженное выражение лица Как будто тайная грусть неотступно гложет его Вся ее душа видна у нее в глазах и кажется она бы отдала все на свете чтобы очутиться сейчас одной в укромной тишине своей комнатки и давши волю слезам не сдерживая томящих чувств выплакаться как следует но только конечно не чересчур потому что она училась перед зеркалом как плакать красиво И зеркальце сказало о Герти ты мила Гаснущий отблеск дня освещает ее лицо невыразимо печальное и задумчивое Напрасно томится Герти Макдауэлл Да она с самого начала знала что ее мечтам о замужестве не суждено сбыться и не трезвонить колоколам на свадьбе миссис Регги Уайли КТДпотому что миссис Уайли будет та на ком женится старший брат и в светской хронике не появиться строкам о том что миссис Гертруда Уайли была в эффектном туалете серых тонов с роскошной меховой отделкой из голубого песца Он слишком молод чтобы понять Едва ли он способен верить в любовь это удел женщины В тот давний вечер на празднике у Сторов он еще тогда ходил в коротких штанишках когда они оказались одни он воровато обнял ее за талию и она вся побелела как мелИзменившимся странно охрипшим голосом он назвал ее малышкой и торопливо еле скользнув губами поцеловал ее первый поцелуй но это получилось один только кончик носа и тут же он заспешил из комнаты бормоча чтото насчет закусок Какойто взбалмошный Сила характера никогда не была сильной стороной Регги Уайли а тот кто сумел бы покорить и увлечь Герти Макдауэлл уж конечно должен быть настоящим мужчиной Вот только ждать постоянно ждать пока на тебя обратят внимание а тут как раз високосный год который не успеешь оглянуться пройдет Нет ее идеал возлюбленного  не прекрасный принц приносящий к ее ногам дивный и редкостный дар своей любви скорей это закаленный мужчина невозмутимый и сильный которому не посчастливилось встретить свой идеал может быть у него на висках уже блестит седина и он бы понял ее надежно укрыл бы ее в своих объятиях привлек бы ее к себе со всею силой своей глубоко страстной натуры и прильнул бы к ее устам долгим нескончаемым поцелуем Это было бы чтото райское Вот о ком затаенно мечтает она в этот летний задумчивый вечерВсем сердцем своим она жаждет стать его единственной его нареченной невестой в бедности и в богатстве в немощах и в здоровье покуда смерть не разлучит нас и да будет впредь по семуИ пока Эди Бордмен возилась за колясочкой с маленьким Томми она как раз думала о том придет ли завтрашний день когда она сможет назвать себя его будущей женушкой Вот уж тогда пускай они судачат про нее хоть до одури и Берта Сапл и Эди которая такая злючка потому что ей в ноябре стукнет уже двадцать два Она бы заботилась о нем создала бы ему все мыслимые удобства потому что Герти не обделенная женской мудростью хорошо понимала что всякий мужчина любит у себя в доме уют Ее оладьи доведенные до золотистокоричневого цвета и пудинг королевы Анны хранящий вкус и аромат свежих сливок всегда вызывали шумные похвалы потому что у нее была легкая рука зажигать огонь значит засыпаешь тонкую муку с сухими дрожжами и помешиваешь все время в одном направлении потом молоко и сахар и хорошо взбитые белки хотя когда доходило до еды она не любила стеснялась при людях и думала как жаль что нельзя питаться чемнибудь таким поэтическим фиалками или розами и она бы чудно обставила их гостиную там были бы всякие картины гравюры и фотография Гарриоуна собачки дедушки Гилтрапа она почти была как человек казалось вотвот заговорит и на стульях покрышки из узорной набойки и серебряный тостер какие бывают в богатых домах она видела такой на распродаже у Клери Он будет высокий широкоплечий она всегда мечтала чтобы муж был высокий с белозубой улыбкой под красиво подстриженными усами и они поедут на континент чтобы там провести свой медовый месяц три упоительные недели а потом когда они устроят себе уютное гнездышко такой маленький миленький домик то каждое утро будут завтракать вместе это будет простой но безупречно сервированный завтрак только на две их персоны больше ни для кого и уходя на службу он крепко обнимет свою милую женушку и на минуту глянет в самую глубину ее глазЭди Бордмен спросила у Томми Кэффри все ли он сделал он сказал да тогда она застегнула ему штанишки и сказала чтобы он бежал играть с Джеки только пусть они оба будут теперь хорошие и не ссорятся Но Томми сказал что он хочет мячик а Эди ответила нельзя с мячиком играет малютка и если у него забрать начнется сразу концерт но Томми сказал нет это его мячик и он хочет свой мячик и топнул ножкой Нет вы подумайте Ну и характер Да он уже был мужчиной этот маленький Томми едва выйдя из пеленок Но Эди ему ответила нет нет и нет и чтобы он прекратил и сказала Сисси чтобы та не уступала ему А ты мне не сестра  заявил неслух Томми  Хочу мой мячикНо тут Сисси Кэффри сказала малютке Бордмену посмотрика сюда посмотри на мой пальчик и быстрым движением подхватила мяч Она катнула его по песку и Томми одержав победу со всех ног пустился за ним Главное чтобы было тихо  засмеялась СиссиОна пощекотала крошке его пухлые щечки чтобы он поскорей забыл и принялась с ним играть в сорокаворона кашку варила деток кормила этому дала и этому дала и этому дала и этому дала а самому маленькому не дала Но тут Эди расшипелась что вот так он вечно и вытворяет что ему вздумается раз все его балуют без конца Вот погодите  посулила она  я еще ему всыплю по одному месту Атата по попке  весело рассмеялась СиссиГерти низко опустила голову и густо покраснела подумав что Сисси употребляет недопустимые для барышни выражения каких она сама не произнесла бы ни за что на свете лучше сгорела бы со стыда она вся залилась горячим румянцем а Эди Бордмен сказала что джентльмен поблизости наверняка все слышал Но Сисси это не волновало ни на мизинец Ну и пускай  воскликнула она тряхнув беззаботно головой и озорно сморщив носик  Можно заодно и ему по тому же месту У меня это быстроШальная Сисе с негритянскими кудряшками Бывает с ней обхохочешьсяНапример скажет ты выпей лимонаду а я таю с чортом или нарисует красным на своих ноготках на одном  кружку на другом  мужскую физиономию все конечно покатываются или когда ей захочется в одно место объявит вдруг я должна нанести визит мисс Писс Вот такая вот она вся Сиссикумс Ой а разве забыть тот вечер когда она напялила на себя отцовский костюм и шляпу подрисовала жженой пробкой усы и с сигареткой пошла разгуливать по Трайтонвиллроуд По части шуток и розыгрышей за ней никому не угнатьсяНо при всем том  чистейшая искренность одно из самых смелых и верных сердец какие Бог сотворил не из тех двуличных созданий что чересчур деликатны для прямотыЗдесь в воздухе разнеслись звуки пения и органного гимна То совершались молитва проповедь и освящение Святых Даров в приюте трезвости для мужчин которым руководил миссионер преподобный Джон Хьюз ОИ Там они собирались вместе без всякого различия сословий и это было весьма поучительное зрелище ибо все они были вынесены мирскими бурями в сей скромный храм на берегу волн и все припадая к стопам Непорочной читали молитву Божией Матери Лоретской просили ее заступничества обращая к ней древние такие знакомые слова пресвятая Мария пресвятая и пречистая дева Какую печаль несли эти звуки бедняжке Герти Если б только ее отец вырвался из когтей зеленого змия с помощью ли обета или тех порошков исцеляющих от страсти к вину про которые было в Пирсонс уикли она бы разъезжала сейчас в своей собственной карете не хуже кого угодно Она повторяла это себе несчетное число раз сидя в грустной задумчивости у догорающего камина не зажигая огня потому что она терпеть не могла двойной свет или мечтательно размышляя по целым часам глядя из окошка на то как дождь колотит в ржавый мусорный бак Но гнусное зелье разбившее столько очагов столько семей бросило мрачную тень на ее детские годыШутка сказать ей даже довелось повидать в своем доме буйства чинимые от невоздержности и быть свидетельницей тому как ее собственный отец распаляемый губительными парами совершенно забывал себя ибо тверже всего на свете Герти знала одно если мужчина когданибудь посмеет коснуться женщины иначе нежели с добротой и лаской он достоин звания самого низкого негодяяГолоса продолжали петь воссылая молитвы Деве Всемогущей Всеблагой Деве А Герти погруженная в свои думы словно не слышала и не видела ни своих подружек ни резвящихся близнецов ни джентльмена который появился со стороны Сэндимаунт Грин  Сисси нашла что он очень похож на отца  и совершал небольшую прогулку вдоль берега Конечно на людях его никогда не увидишь навеселе но все равно он ей не нравился как отец может изза того что был слишком стар или еще почемунибудь а может изза лица словом тут явно был случай доктора Фелла или же угреватого бугристого носа или рыжих усов уже побелевших под носом Бедный папа Она его любила при всех его грехах и ей нравилось когда он пел О Мэри скажи как тебя покорить и Мой домик и любовь моя вблизи от Ла Рошели и на ужин были тушеные моллюски и салат под майонезом и когда он пел Взошла луна с мистером Дигнамом который так внезапно умер и уже схоронили помилуй Господи его душу от удара Это было в день рождения мамы Чарли был дома на каникулах и Том и мистер Дигнам с женой и Пэтси и Фредди Дигнам и они все вместе сфотографировались Кто бы подумал что конец уже так близко А сейчас он в могиле А мама ему сказала что пусть это ему послужит предупреждением до конца его дней а он даже не смог пойти на похороны изза своей подагры и ей пришлось сходить в город принести ему с работы письма и образцы линолеума Кэтсби художественный рисунок годится хоть для дворца высокая прочность и в доме всегда ярко и веселоГерти была не дочка а просто сокровище вторая мать всей семье помощница и ангелхранитель золотое сердечко Когда у матери случались эти ужасные мигрени такие что голова раскалывалась кто как не Герти всегда натирала ей лоб ментоловой свечкой хоть ей и не нравилось что мать нюхает табак это было одноединственное изза чего у них выходили споры нюхать табак Все неустанно ее хвалили за ее милое обхождениеИменно Герти всегда отключала газ на ночь и Герти же повесила на стенке в одном местечке где она никогда не забывала посыпать хлоркой каждые две недели календарь с картиной В идиллические времена что им подарил мистер Танни бакалейщик На этой картине молодой джентльмен одетый постаринному в треуголке протягивал своей возлюбленной даме букет цветов через решетку ее окна со всей галантностью того давнего времениСразу ясно что за этим какаято история И как приятно подобраны краскиОна в белом из облегающей мягкой ткани и поза самая изысканная а кавалер в наряде шоколадного цвета и выглядит аристократом до кончиков ногтей И часто заходя туда койзачем она мечтательно глядела на них и засучив слегка рукава трогала свои руки такие же белые и мягкие как у той и размышляла о тех временах потому что она нашла в словаре произношения Уокера который остался от дедушки Гилтрапа что это значит идиллическийБлизнецы теперь играли вполне побратски самым похвальным образом до тех пор пока юный Джеки который и в самом деле был отчаянный озорун от этого никуда не денешься нарочно не наподдал мячик изо всех сил в сторону затянутых тиной скал Само собой ясно что бедный Томми выказал бурное огорчение но к счастью джентльмен в черном сидевший там в одиночестве отважно ринулся на выручку и поймал мяч Оба соперника с истошными воплями тут же принялись требовать любимую игрушку и чтобы выйти из положения Сисси Кэффри обратилась к джентльмену бросьте его мне пожалуйстаДжентльмен примерился раздругой и метнул его по песку в сторону Сисси но он откатился под уклон и остановился у маленькой лужицы под скалой в точности подле юбки Герти Близнецы немедля возобновили свои требования и Сисси попросила ее стукнуть его к ним и пусть они ловят кто поймает так что Герти отвела ножку но она предпочла бы чтоб этот их глупый мяч не закатывался к ней и попыталась ударить по нему но промазала а Эди и Сисси рассмеялись Раз не вышло пробуй снова  сказала Эди БордменГерти улыбнулась в знак согласия и закусила губку Ее нежные щеки порозовели однако она твердо решила им показать и потому приподняла чутьчуть юбку немножко но так чтобы не мешала и хорошенько прицелившись лихо наподдала ножкой по мячу так что тот отлетел далекодалеко а оба близнеца припустились за ним по гальке Конечно это была чистейшая ревность только чтобы привлечь внимание джентльмена наблюдавшего неподалеку Она почувствовала как жаркий румянец прихлынул и заполыхал на ее щеках а это всегда был опасный знак у Герти МакдауэллПокамест они лишь мельком поглядывали друг на друга но сейчас она рискнула посмотреть пристальней изпод полей новой шляпы и ей показалось что она в жизни своей не видела такого печального лица какоето странно вытянутое вымотанное что встретил ее взор в подступающих сумеркахБлагоухания струились через раскрытые окна церкви и вместе с ними благоуханные имена той что была зачата неоскверненно ковчег духовный молись за нас ковчег поклонения молись за нас ковчег благочестия несказанного молись за нас о роза таиАнственная И были там заботой снедаемые сердца и труждающиеся ради хлеба насущного и многие что блуждали и заблуждались глаза же их были увлажнены раскаянием но купно и светились надеждой ибо поведал им преподобный отец Хьюз то что сказал Бернард великий святой в своей прославленной молитве к Матери Божией что дарована Приснодеве всякая власть предстательская и не слыхано от века никем чтобы она оставила без участия вопиющих к нейБлизнецы снова безмятежно резвились ибо в детстве огорчения наши мимолетны как летний дождик Сисси все играла с малюткой Бордменом и тот агукал от удовольствия поводя в воздухе ручонками Тикток подавала она голос спрятавшись за верхом коляски и Эди спрашивала а куда делась Сисси и тогда она вдруг выглядывала и восклицала куку а мальчуганчик я вам ручаюсь весь расплывался от восторга Потом она стала просить его скажи папа Ну скажи папа маленький Скажи папапапапапапаИ тот старался вовсю потому что все говорили для своих одиннадцати месяцев он был просто необычайно развит и притом крупный здоровенький прямо на загляденье такой тебе крошкаочаровашка и все в один голос предсказывали что из него вырастет какойнибудь великий человек АляляляаляСисси утерла ему ротик слюнявчиком и хотела его усадить понастоящему и чтобы он говорил папапа но едва она его развернула она так и ахнула святой Дионисий да он же мокрый хоть выжимай надо скорей перевернуть под ним двойную пеленку другой стороной Разумеется эти формальности туалета вызвали досаду и недовольство его младенческого величества о чем они и довели до общего сведения Уааа куаакуаакуаа уааИ две большие круглые симпатичные слезинки покатились вниз по его щекам Тут было бесполезно утешать ну что ты что ты малыш или начинать про всяких там гавгав и муму но Сисси как всегда моментально сообразив сунула ему в рот бутылочку с соской и маленький язычник вскоре затихГерти нестерпимо хотелось чтобы они забрали поскорей домой своего писклявого младенца не действовал бы на нервы и вообще ему уже поздно а заодно и этих сопливых близнецов Взор ее устремлен был в морскую дальОна ей напоминала картины которые уличный художник рисовал цветными мелками на мостовой и было ужасно жаль что они там останутся и сотрутся вечер и плывущие облака и маяк Бейли на мысу а ты сидишь так вот и слушаешь музыку и доносится аромат это они там ладан жгут в церкви Но между тем как она глядела вдаль сердечко ее так и колотилось Да это именно на нее он смотрел и притом таким особенным взглядом Его глаза жгли ее словно хотели проникнуть в самую глубину прочесть что у ней в душе Они были чудесны эти глаза они были несказанно выразительны только можно ли довериться им Люди бывают такие странные Она сразу поняла что он иностранец по его темным глазам и интеллигентному бледному лицу живая копия ее фотографии Мартина Харви самого модного актера если не считать усов но они ей всегда нравились потому что она не была так помешана на театре как Уинни Риппингам та даже предлагала чтобы они с ней одинаково одевались потому что по пьесе но только с ее места было не видно какой у него нос орлиный или же слегка Он был в глубоком трауре это она увидела сразу и на лице у него читалась повесть печали и мук Она бы отдала все на свете за то чтобы узнать их причину Его взгляд был таким настойчивым неотрывным и он видел как она стукнула по мячу так что мог бы наверно заметить и блестящие пряжки на туфельках если она ими будет задумчиво покачивать вот так вниз носочкомОна была рада что утром чутье подсказало ей надеть эти прозрачные чулки тогда ее мысль была что может быть она встретит Регги Уайли но сейчас все это уже в прошлом Перед нею явился тот о котором она столько мечтала Он и только он имел значение и на ее лице была радость потому что она жаждала его потому что она чувствовала всей душой что он и есть ее неповторимый единственный Всем своим сердцем девушкиженщины она стремилась к нему суженому супругу ее мечтаний потому что с первого взгляда она уже знала что это он И если он страдал перед другими не был грешен но лишь другие перед ним и если бы даже наоборот если бы даже он сам прежде был грешник дурной человек это ее не остановило бы Если даже он протестант или методист все равно она его легко обратит если только он понастоящему ее любит Бывают раны которые исцелит один сердечный бальзам Она была настоящей женщиной не то что теперешние ветреницы без капли женственности каких он наверно знал как эти велосипедистки у которых все напоказ чего у них нет и она сгорала от жажды все узнать все простить если бы только она сумела так сделать чтобы он полюбил ее и воспоминания утратили власть И тогда может статься он бы нежно обнял ее и как настоящий мужчина до боли крепко стиснул бы ее гибкий стан и любил бы ее лишь ради нее самой единственную свою девочкуПрибежище грешников Всех скорбящих радость    Как хорошо это сказано что тот кто молится ей с верою и усердием никогда не будет оставлен или отвергнут и как хорошо подходит что она гавань и прибежище для скорбящих потому что у нее у самой сердце пронзили семь скорбей Герти живо представляла себе всю сцену в церкви светящиеся витражи в окнах свечи цветы и голубые хоругви братства Пресвятой Девы а в алтаре отец Конрой помогает канонику ОХанлону уносит и приносит разные вещи опустив глаза долу Он выглядел почти как святой в его исповедальне всегда было так чисто спокойно и мягкий сумрак и его руки будто из белого воска а если когданибудь она станет доминиканской монахиней в этом их белом одеянии то может он приходил бы к ней в монастырь в новену святого Доминика В тот раз когда она сказала ему на исповеди что у нее это самое и покраснела до корней волос боясь что сейчас он посмотрит на нее он ей ответил чтобы она не беспокоилась это просто голос природы и сказал мы все подчиняемся ее законам в нашей земной жизни и греха в этом нет потому что это исходит от женского естества каким его сотворил Господь так он сказал и даже наша Владычица сказала архангелу Гавриилу да будет со мною по Слову Твоему Он был такой благостный такой добрый что ей очень часто хотелось сделать ему какойто подарок может быть покрышку на чайник с рюшиками и вышить на ней цветы или часы хотя часы у них есть она их видела на каминной полке белые с золотом а сверху маленький домик откуда выскакивала каждые полчаса птичка и звонко выкрикивала она зашла в тот день насчет цветов для сорокачасового поклонения потому что это же трудно выбрать подарок может быть альбом с видами Дублина или какихто еще местНевыносимые сорванцыблизнецы опять затеяли склоку Джеки запустил мячом в сторону моря и оба они помчались за ним Мартышки несчастные надоели как лужи осенью Давно уж пора чтобы ктонибудь хорошенько их проучил Эди и Сисси тут же принялись кричать им вслед чтобы они вернулись перепугавшись что нахлынет прилив и они утонут Джеки ТоммиИ не подумали Такие умники стали Тогда Сисси объявила что это последний раз в жизни она их взяла гулять Она вскочила и продолжая их окликать устремилась за ними под уклон откидывая на бегу свои волосы по цвету они у ней были ничего только если бы еще подлинней но хотя она в них чегочего ни втирала не станем уж уточнять они ни чуточки не росли потому что такие есть так что ей одно оставалось делать самой авансы Она бежала пожуравлиному вымахивая ногами странно как юбка не лопалась в ней масса была мальчишеского в Сисси Кэффри и притом она никогда не упускала случая пофорсить а уж тут она знала что бегает как никто потому и проявила такую прыть чтобы он увидал как у нее подол нижней юбки развевается на бегу да голенастые ноги оголяются выше границ приличияПросто очень было бы поделом если бы вот сейчас она зацепилась за чтонибудь этими высоченными гнутыми французскими каблуками все хочет повыше быть да шлепнулась в землю носом  Дивное зрелище мужчине есть на что посмотретьЦарица ангелов царица патриархов царица пророков и всех святых так молились они царица трисвятейшего вертограда а потом отец Конрой передал кадило канонику ОХанлону и тот положив туда ладан окадил Святые Дары а Сисси Кэффри изловила близнецов и руки у нее так и чесались хорошенько надрать им уши но она не стала потому что думала может он на нее смотрит только на этот счет она очень глубоко ошибалась потому что Герти даже не глядя видела как он не сводил с нее глаз а потом каноник ОХанлон снова отдал кадило отцу Конрою и стал на колени глядя кверху на Святые Дары и хор запел   и она стала покачивать ногой в такт музыке тантумер госа крамен тумТри шиллинга и одиннадцать пенсов она отдала за эти чулки у Спэрроу на Джорджстрит это было во вторник нет в понедельник на Страстной и до сих пор все петли целы вот он на что смотрел прозрачные а вовсе не на ее замухрышные там ни тела ни линии какая нахалка он же не слепой сам какнибудь видит разницуСисси поднималась с моря с двумя близнецами и с мячиком и таща за собой мальчишек выглядела под стать любой стрил шляпка у нее от бега съехала набок тонкая блузка купленная всего полмесяца назад превратилась чуть ли не в тряпку и для полноты картины сзади торчала нижняя юбка как рисуют на карикатурах И вот тут Герти сняла на миг свою шляпу чтобы поправить волосы Истинный бог более изящной очаровательной головки не красовалось никогда на девичьих плечиках маленькое сияющее диво способное свести с ума своей нежной прелестью Долго пришлось бы постранствовать по свету чтобы отыскать чтолибо подобное роскоши этих ореховых локонов Она почти уловила как быстрая искорка восхищения ответно вспыхнула у него в глазах и от этого все струнки в ней затрепетали и напряглись Она снова надела шляпу опустив поля настолько чтобы изпод них можно было наблюдать и ножка посверкивая пряжкой стала покачиваться чуть быстрей потому что дыхание у Герти перехватило когда она перехватила это выражение в его глазах Он смотрел на нее так как смотрит удав на свою жертву Женский инстинкт подсказывал ей что она разбудила в нем дьявола и при этой мысли горячая алость начала подниматься от ее шеи ко лбу пока все личико не сделалось пунцовее розыЭто не укрылось от Эди Бордмен потому что она все время косилась на Герти с кривой улыбочкой в очках как старой деве положено а сама делала вид как будто баюкает малыша Настырней всякого комара такая она и была и будет вот потому с ней никто и не мог поладить потому что она вечно суется не в свое дело И Эди сказала Герти Интересненько что это у тебя на уме Что  отвечала Герти с улыбкой приоткрывшей белые зубки  Я просто подумала что уже поздноватоПотому что она не чаяла дождаться когда наконец эти сопливые близнецы а заодно и младенец уберутся подобрупоздорову поэтому она и намекнула вежливо что уже поздновато И когда Сисси вернулась к ним Эди спросила у нее который час а мисс Сисе что за словом в карман не лезет ответила без пяти поцелуев час целоваться Но Эди непременно хотела знать потому что им наказали быть пораньше Погоди тогда  сказала ей Сисси  сбегаю спрошу у своего дядюшки Питера который вон там торчит сколько на его луковицеИ она направилась к нему а когда он увидел как она подходит то Герти заметила что он вытащил руку из кармана както занервничал и стал поигрывать часовой цепочкой и разглядывать церковь Да у него была страстная натура но при этом как теперь Герти видела он потрясающе владел собой Только что он был весь под ее обаянием глаз от нее не мог оторвать  и вот в один миг перед вами серьезнейший джентльмен и каждая черточка его солидной фигуры выражает полное самообладаниеСисси попросила ее извинить и не будет ли он так добр сказать ей точное время и Герти видела как он достает часы подносит их к уху потом поднимает глаза и кашлянув говорит что к величайшему его сожалению часы у него остановились но он полагает сейчас уже больше восьми потому что солнце зашло Он говорил с очень культурными интонациями размеренным голосом но несмотря на это словно какаято дрожь проскальзывала в мягком звучании его речи Сисси сказала спасибо и вернувшись обратно высунула им язык и объявила дядюшка говорит его луковица слегка протухлаПотом они запели второй стих из   и каноник ОХанлон снова поднялся и окадил Святые Дары и стал на колени и тут он сказал отцу Конрою что от одной из свечек вотвот могут загореться цветы и отец Конрой поднялся и поправил цветы и свечу и она видела как джентльмен заводит свои часы и прислушивается идут ли они и она снова стала покачивать ножкой в такт музыке Уже темнело но всетаки ему еще было видно и он не отрываясь смотрел все время пока заводил часы или что там он с ними делал а потом он положил их назад и снова сунул руки в карманыОна почувствовала некое ощущение во всем теле покалывало кожу на голове планшетки корсета раздражали и она знала что у нее начинается потому что в последний раз это было тоже когда она подрезала волосы в новолуние Его темные глаза снова прикованные к ней впивали все ее очертания поклонялись ей как божеству это совершенно буквально Если вообще когданибудь взгляд мужчины может выражать страстное и неприкрытое обожание  сейчас оно было написано на его лице И эта дань обожания  тебе Гертруда Макдауэлл и ты знаешь этоЭди начала собираться в путь давно ей было пора и Герти заметила что ее намек возымел желанное действие потому что по пляжу было довольно далеко до того места где можно подняться с коляской а Сисси сняла с близнецов беретки и принялась заботливо их причесывать конечно чтобы самой выглядеть симпатичней а каноник ОХанлон поднялся риза его встопорщилась колом на спине и отец Конрой передал ему листок с текстом и он начал читать      а Эди и Сисси тараторили все время про время и приставали к ней но Герти превосходно сумела им дать отпор и отвечала коротко с убийственной вежливостью когда Эди спросила не разбил ли ей сердце ее лучший поклонник внезапно бросив ее Герти вся сжалась словно от резкой боли Глаза ее в тот же миг метнули холодную молнию вместившую в себя безмерный заряд презрения О да это мучило ее это резало по живому потому что Эди эта коварная кошка отлично усвоила манеру говорить с невинным видом такие вещи которые как сама она знала ранят и убивают Губы Герти раскрылись слово уже готово было слететь с них но ей так и не удалось его сказать потому что рыдания подступили к горлу ее гибкому совершенно идеальному горлу линии которого восхитили бы любого художника Он ведать не ведал как сильно она любила его Легкомысленный обманщик ненадежный непостоянный как весь его пол он никогда в жизни не сумел бы понять сколько он значил для нее и на мгновение ее глаза уже защипало от слезНо они так и сверлили ее своими безжалостными глазами и сделав героическое усилие она нарочно для них бросила самый благосклонный взгляд на нового своего вассала О  с быстротою молнии парировала Герти смеясь и гордо вздернув головку  годто ведь високосный я и сама могу выбирать кого захочуОна говорила чистым и звонким голосом мелодичным как воркованье лесного голубя и все же в наступившем молчании ее слова падали резко и холодно Чтото явно слышалось в этом молодом голосе что давало понятьтакая девушка никому не игрушка А мистера Регги со всем его бахвальством и с капиталами она бы просто отодвинула ножкой как мусор с дороги и больше никогда бы не вспоминала и эту его несчастную открытку разорвала бы на мелкие кусочки И если бы он когданибудь еще осмелился она бы его наградила таким взглядом с таким презрением что он бы умер на месте У ее ничтожества мисс Эди физиономия весьма вытянулась стала можно сказать темней черной тучи и Герти насквозь видела что она готова просто лопнуть со злости хотя и не подает виду маленькая киннат потому что у ней задели самое больное место ее мелкую зависть они же обе знали что онато в этих делах при пиковом интересе навек чужая на этом празднике жизни и коекто еще тоже это отлично знал и видел так что им теперь только оставалось утеретьсяЭди уложила поудобней малютку готовясь в путь Сисси собрала лопатки ведерки мячик и было уже совсем пора Бордменумладшему подошло время засыпать И Сисси ему сказала что гдето тут уже бродит Вилли Закрой Глазки и значит малюткам пора байбай но малютка никак не унимаясь радостно таращил глазенки и хохотал так что Сисси стало самой смешно и она пощекотала слегка его пухленькое брюшко а он не нуждаясь в позволении тут же излил свою горячую благодарность на новенький нарядный слюнявчик Вот тебе на  расстроилась Сисси  Приехали с орехами Совсем слюнявчик испортилЭтот легкий  потребовал ее внимания но в два счета она вновь навела порядокУ Герти вырвалось сдавленное восклицание она нервно кашлянула и Эди тут же переспросила чточто и ей хотелось ответить глухим две обедни не служат но она всегда соблюдала самые светские манеры и поэтому просто тактично обошла ответив что это благословение потому что как раз в ту минуту над берегом прозвучал в тишине удар церковного колокола потому что каноник ОХанлон вошел в алтарь в облачении которое надел ему на плечи отец Конрой и благословлял держа в руках Святые ДарыКак трогала чувства вся эта сцена в наплывающих сумерках и Эрина прощальная краса и наводящий думы вечерний звон и юркая тень летучей мыши что снялась с колокольни увитой плющом и с тоненьким жалобнорастерянным криком носилась острыми зигзагами на гаснущем фоне неба Далекодалеко светились огни маяков так красиво ей бы очень хотелось нарисовать это красками ведь это легче чем человека и скоро уже фонарщик выйдет в свой путь мимо пресвитерианской церкви потом по тенистой Трайтонвилл авеню где прогуливаются парочки потом он зажжет фонарь невдалеке от ее окна тот самый где Регги Уайли всегда разворачивал свой велосипед и все как в книжке Фонарщик мисс Камминс которая еще написала Мейбл Вохен и другие истории Дело в том что у Герти были свои сокровенные мечты которых она не открывала никому Она любила стихи и когда Берта Сапл подарила ей альбом для записи разных мыслей очень миленький в коралловорозовой обложке она его спрятала к себе в свой туалетный столик который правда нельзя было упрекнуть в роскоши но зато он просто сверкал образцовой чистотой и порядком Там в ящичке она сберегала свои девичьи сокровища там у нее хранились черепаховые гребни значок Детей Марии духи Белая роза краска для бровей гипсовая шкатулочка для духов ленточки которые она меняла на белье когда его приносили из стирки а в альбоме уже были разные красивые изречения она их записывала фиолетовыми чернилами купленными у Хили на Дэймстрит и как ей чувствовалось она бы даже могла сама сочинять стихи если бы только умела так хорошо выражаться как в этом стихотворении она его случайно увидела в газете куда были завернуты овощи и оно так понравилось ей что она тут же переписала его все целиком Оно называлось Идеал мой ты лишь греза сочинил Луис ДжУолш из Маэрфелта и дальше шло сумерки о ты о скоро ль или вроде этого и часто от прелести стихов столь грустной в своей хрупкой красе взор ее застилали тихие слезы потому что она чувствовала что годы ее уходят один за другим и если бы не этот единственный недостаток она бы вообще не знала соперниц все изза того случая когда она спускалась по Долкихилл и она всячески старалась это скрывать Но она чувствовала дальше так не может тянуться Если бы только она уловила в его глазах этот волшебный зов ее бы ничто не остановило Любовь не запереть под замок Она бы принесла великую жертву Она бы старалась всеми усилиями разделить его мысли И она стала бы для него дороже всего на свете и наполнила его дни счастьем Но тут оставался наиважнейший вопрос ей просто смертельно надо было узнать женат он или вдовец потерявший свою супругу а может быть случилась трагедия как у того знатного дворянина из страны песен который вынужден был поместить ее в сумасшедший дом из жалости жестокость проявляя Но даже допустим  ну и что Такая ли уж большая разница Глубоко сидящий инстинкт отталкивал ее от малейшей неделикатности грубости Ей были отвратительны эти создания падшие женщины что прохаживаются по берегу Доддера не гнушаясь солдатами и мужичьем забыв про девичью честь и позоря свой пол их даже забирают в полицию Нет нет что угодно только не это Они будут просто хорошие друзья как взрослые брат с сестрой и больше ничего такого вопреки всем нравам Общества с большой буквы А может быть он носил траур в память о былой страсти владевшей им в незапамятные деньки Ей думалось она поняла Она постаралась бы его понять потому что мужчины они настолько отличаются Старая любовь все ждала ждала простирая тонкие белоснежные руки с мольбою устремляя голубые глаза Сердце мое Она пошла бы за своей любовью своей мечтой не оглядываясь следуя только голосу сердца которое говорило ей что он  все для нее единственный в целом мире ибо одна любовь правит всем Больше ничто не важно Будь что будет она порвала бы все оковы все запреты она была бы свободнаКаноник ОХанлон положил Святые Дары обратно в дарохранительницу и преклонил колена хор запел     и он запер дарохранительницу потому что обряд благословения был окончен и отец Конрой подал ему шляпу а Эди противная кошка спросила ты что не собираешься идти но тут Джеки Кэффри закричал Ой Сисси поглядиИ все посмотрели может быть это зарницы но Томми тоже это увидел там над деревьями за церковью красное и синее и зеленое А это фейерверк  сказала СиссиИ все они побежали по пляжу чтобы поспеть увидеть над церковью и над домами всей гурьбой Эди с коляской в ней малыш Бордмен Сисси и Томми и Джеки она их держала за руки а то могли упасть на бегу Герти иди сюда  позвала Сисси  Это фейерверк в честь благотворительного праздникаНо Герти была тверда Она не намерена бегать за ними как на веревочкеИ она отвечала что если им нравится они могут скакать как угорелые а она посидит ей и отсюда хорошо видно Глаза что были прикованы к ней волновали ей кровь и сердце На миг она глянула прямо на него и взоры их встретились и словно молния озарила все ее существо Жгучая страсть была на его лице безмолвная как могила и эта страсть покорила ее емуНаконец то они были одни без людской зависти и докуки и она знала что этому человеку можно довериться на жизнь и на смерть что он верен и тверд и что он человек чести до последнего дюйма И руки и лицо его были в возбуждении и ее охватила дрожь Она сильно откинулась назад стараясь разглядеть фейерверк обхватила колени руками чтобы не потерять равновесие и совершенно никто не мог увидеть только она и он когда она совсем открыла свои хорошенькие ножки вот так они были нежно упругие изящно округленные словно выточенные и ей казалось будто она так и слышит его неровное тяжкое дыхание и гулкий стук его сердца потому что она уже знала насчет таких вот мужчин страстных с горячей кровью потому что Берта Сапл однажды ей рассказала под самым страшным секретом чтобы никогда никому про их квартиранта из Комиссии по Перенаселенным Районам он вырезал из журналов картинки с полуголыми шансонетками и с танцовщицами задирающими ноги и она сказала он занимался коечем нехорошим можешь сама догадаться чем иногда у себя в постели Но тут ведь совершенно другое потому что огромная разница потому что она почти чувствовала как он привлекает ее лицо к своему почти осязала первое быстрое обжигающее прикосновение этих красивых губ И потом есть ведь и отпущение грехов если только ты не позволила этого самого до свадьбы и еще пусть были бы священники женщины им бы не нужно было все говорить словами они бы так поняли а у Сисси Кэффри тоже иногда бывает такой блаженный вид с совершенно блаженными глазками так что и ты моя милочка а эта Уинни Риппингам что просто помешана на фотографиях актеров и потом это все изза того что как раз это самое начинается вот это изза чегоИ Джеки Кэффри закричал смотрите там еще и она еще отклонилась назад и подвязки у нее были голубые это подходило к прозрачному и все увидели и закричали смотрите смотрите вон там и она еще и еще сильней отклонялась назад чтобы разглядеть фейерверк и чтото непонятное носилось в воздухе темное туда и сюда И она увидала большую римскую свечу которая поднималась над деревьями выше и выше и все в восторге затаили дыхание молча и напряженно следя как она поднимается все выше выше и ей приходилось все дальше и дальше запрокидываться назад почти ложась на спину чтобы следить за ней еще еще выше почти скрылась из глаз и лицо ее залилось дивным пленительным румянцем от такой позы и теперь он мог увидеть еще много нового батистовые панталоны материя прямо ласкает кожу и лучше чем те зауженные зеленые за четыре одиннадцать а эти беленькие и она ему позволяла и видела что он видит а свеча поднялась так высоко что на мгновение совсем исчезла и все мускулы у нее дрожали изза того что так запрокинулась а перед ним было полное зрелище гораздо выше колен такого она еще никогда никому даже на качелях или переходя вброд но ей не было стыдно и ему тоже не было что он так неприлично впился глазами он же не мог устоять перед таким дивным зрелищем когда перед ним все так открыто как у тех танцовщиц что задирают ноги совершенно неприлично а мужчины смотрят на них и он все смотрел смотрелЕй хотелось закричать позвать его задыхающимся голосом протянуть к нему свои тонкие белоснежные руки чтобы он пришел чтобы она ощутила его губы на своем чистом лбу крик любви юной девушки слабый сдавленный крик исторгнутый у нее против воли звенящий сквозь все века и эпохи И тут взвилась ракета на мгновение ослепив Ах и лопнула римская свеча и донесся вздох словно Ах и в экстазе никто не мог удержаться Ах Ах и оттуда хлынул целый поток золотых нитей они сверкали струились ах и падали вниз как зеленозолотые звездыросинки ах это так прекрасно ах это дивно сказочно дивноИ как росинки они растаяли в сгустившихся сумерках  и настало молчание Ах Она поспешно выпрямилась и бросила на него быстрый несмелый взгляд полный кроткого протеста мягкого застенчивого упрека и под этим взглядом он покраснел словно девушка Спиною он прислонялся к скалеЛеопольд Блум ибо это был он стоит молча потупив голову под ее чистым невинным взглядом Какой же он гнусный тип Снова за старое Юная неиспорченная душа воззвала к нему а он жалкое существо как же он на это откликнулся Проявил себя как последний подонок Причем не ктонибудь он Но в этих глазах светилось безграничное милосердие они и его готовы были простить пускай он сбился с пути блуждал и грешил Разве девушка должна говорить Нет тысячу раз нет Это их секрет их личная тайна которую скрыли сумерки и которую будут знать лишь они одни  да маленькая летучая мышь что мягко носилась тудасюда а летучие мыши умеют хранить секретыСисси Кэффри свистнула помальчишечьи показать свои необыкновенные таланты и громко позвала Герти Герти Мы уходим пошли Мы еще оттуда сверху посмотримИ тут у Герти мелькнула мысль одна из маленьких уловок любви Ее пальцы скользнули в нагрудный кармашек вынули надушенную ватку и она помахала ею как бы в ответ конечно следя за ним и потом сунула обратно Хотя не слишком ли далеко до него Она поднялась Так это прощание О нет Ей нужно идти но они еще встретятся снова встретятся здесь а до той минуты она будет мечтать об этом мечтать завтра о том что привиделось накануне Она выпрямилась во весь рост Их души слились в последнем долгом и томном взгляде и глаза его полные странным сиянием проникли в глубь ее сердца и сами словно завороженные не могли оторваться от ее лица нежного как цветок Она слабо улыбнулась ему улыбкой нежной и всепрощающей улыбкой готовою перейти в слезы  и они рассталисьМедленно не оглядываясь назад она шла по неровной полосе пляжа туда к Сисси Эди к Томми и Джеки Кэффри к малышу Бордмену Заметно стемнело а на пляже там и сям попадались камни обломки дерева скользкие водоросли Она двигалась со спокойным достоинством свойственным ей всегда однако осторожно и очень медленно потому что  потому что Герти МакдауэллТуфли жмут Нет Она хромая ОоМистер Блум смотрел как она ковыляет прочь Бедняжка Так вот она почему осталась сидеть когда все помчались Я так и думал тут чтото не то по всему ее виду Покинутая красотка Когда такое у женщины это в десять раз хуже Зато делаются обходительней Хорошо что еще не знал когда она устроила свою выставку Но все равно горячий чертенок Не возражал бы Из разряда диковинок как с монахиней или с негритянкой или когда она в очках Та косоглазенькая кстати весьма субтильна Наверно месячные скоро это подзуживает их У меня сегодня ужасно болит голова А куда я его сунул это письмо Тут все в порядке Всяческие бредовые прихоти Полизать монетку Та монахиня в монастыре Транквилла рассказывала что у них одна девица обожает запах нефти У старых дев думаю уже помешательство под конец Сестра как ее А у скольких женщин в Дублине это сегодня Марта эта Чтото такое в воздухе Луна влияет А тогда почему не у всех женщин менструации в одно время фазыто у луны те же Наверно еще зависит от даты рождения А может все начинают одинаково а после выходят из графика У Молли и Милли иногда совпадаетКак бы там ни было ято воспользовался случаем Правильно что не стал утром в бане над этим ее дурацким я тебя проучу посланием Это мне в утешение за тот трамвай утром Болван Маккой привязался со всякой чушью А эта его жена ангажемент в провинции чемодан голосишком пополам перепилитПризнателен за вашу небольшую услугу Притом дешево По первой просьбеПотому что им самим хочется Естественное желание Каждый вечер их целые косяки из контор Лучше воздерживаться Когда за ними не бегаешь сами липнут Так и бери тепленькими Жаль они сами себя не видят Грезы о чулочках с аппетитной начинкой Где это было Ах да Картинки в райке на Кейплстрит только для мужчин Что подглядел Том Шляпа Вилли и как девочки позабавились с ней Их правда снимают в этаком виде или тут трюк придает эффект Ласкал ее формы под легким дезабилье Их это самих возбуждает Я вся чистенькая иди запачкай меняЛюбят наряжать друг дружку перед великой жертвой Милли была в восторге от новой блузки у Молли Для начала Все наденет чтобы потом все снятьМолли С чего я купил ей сиреневые подвязки Да и мы тоже какой он галстук надел и брюки с манжетами и носки красивые Пришел он в новых гетрах в тот первый вечерок Нарядная рубашка и на кудрях  чего бы там  венок Говорят потерять шпильку  потерять поклонника Пришпиливают Эх у Мэри панталоны на одной булавке Нарядилась для когото как модная куколка Во многом их шарм за счет моды Как только раскусят моду она меняется А на Востоке не так Мария Марфа что сейчас что тогда Никакие серьезные предложения не отвергаются Она вовсе не торопилась Спешат они только на свидание В жизни не позабудут Наверно просто так вышла поискать счастья Они все верят в случай это у них в натуре А другие все ее норовили подколоть Школьные подружки ходят обнявшись или переплетя пальцы целуются каждую минуту и нашептывают друг дружке всякую чепуху под страшным секретом гденибудь в монастырском садике Монашки в строгих наколках лицо вымыто известковым молоком трясут своими четками злобятся на все чего им не полагается Колючая проволока Не беспокойся и пиши мне А я тебе Только будешь ли Молли и Джози Пауэлл Пока не найдет себе а там видятся раз в год по обещанию  Господи нет вы посмотрите кто это Ну как как ты там Что у вас делается Целуются я так рада целуются что я тебя встретила Вотвот пробуравят друг дружку выискивая изъяны в наружности Ты выглядишь изумительно Душисестры нежно оскалились в улыбке Тактак а зубыто у тебя все Щепотку соли одна другой пожалеетЭхКогда у них это дело они словно сатанеют Мрачное дьявольское выражение Молли говорит любая вещица кажется в тонну весом Или вдруг почеши мне пятки Ага ага вот так Ах как чудесно Со мной такое тоже бывает Полезная передышка своего рода Интересно не вредно ли в эти дни быть с ними С одной стороны безопасно При них молоко скисает скрипичные струны лопаются Гдето еще читал в саду цветы вянут Говорят если увидишь женщину с увядшим цветком значит она кокетка Все ониПожалуй она заметила что я Когда на это настроен почти всегда это подвернется Понравился я ей что ли Они всегда смотрят как одет Если он за кем ухаживает тут же это определят при воротничке при манжетахКстати у петухов то же самое и у оленей у львов А иногда вдруг им нравится если галстук или еще там что не в порядке Брюки А вдруг бы я в тот момент когда я Нетнет Надо деликатно Не любят когда грубо набрасываются Поцелуй во тьме и вечная тайна Чтото она нашла во мнеИнтересно что Уж лучше я чем какойнибудь рифмоплет волосенки мажет медвежьим салом над десным оком завиточек приклеен Для помощи джентльмену в литературных В моем возрасте уже надо следить за внешностью В профиль я к ней не поворачивался Хотя тут не угадаешьХорошенькие за уродов выходят Чудище и красавица Потом я уж не совсем какникак Молли Сняла шляпу показать волосы Поля широкие С такими покупают прятать лицо если кого знакомого встретит опустит голову или станет нюхать букетик ах как пахнет От волос во время любви Очески Молли я продал за десять шиллингов когда бедствовали на Холлсстрит А что такого Или допустим он ей даст денег Что такого Одни предрассудкиОна стоит и десять и пятнадцать и фунт А то все за так Почерк и тот нахальный Миссис Мэрион Адресто я не забыл на письме а то может как с той открыткой что послал Флинну А однажды пошел к Дримми и галстук забыл надеть Но тогда это сцена с Молли меня расклеила Нет я помнюРичи Гулдинг тот не такой Все взвесит Странно мои часы остановились в полпятого Пыль Маслом из акульей печенки их смазывают Я бы и сам могДешевле Может это точно в момент когда он с нейДа он был с ней В ней Она с ним ЗаделаноЭхМистер Блум аккуратно расправил влажный подол рубашки Все эта хромая бестия Становится липко зябко Последствия не очень приятны Что делать надо же както разрядиться Их это не смущает Может даже им льститПотом домой к вечерней булочке с молочком перед сном прочтет молитву с детишками Что не такие они Увидишь ее какая есть и все испорчено Тут требуются декорации костюм и грим позы музыка И имя важно Амуры актрис Нелл Гвин миссис Брейсгердл Мод Брэнском Поднимается занавесЛучезарное серебро луны Выступает дева с задумчивым лоном Приди в мои объятия сладость моя Но всетаки чувствуется Придает силы человекуТут то и весь секрет Хорошо я там у стенки отлил выйдя от Дигнама Все этот сидр Иначе не вышло бы А после тянет запеть Лакауз эсант таратара  Допустим я бы заговорил с ней О чем только Лучше не начинать разговор если не знаешь чем кончить Задай вопрос они тебе другой Хороший выход если видишь завяз Конечно это приятно если ты ей добрый вечер и сразу видишь она тоже идет навстречу добрый вечер Ох но как вспомню тот вечер когда чутьчуть не заговорил с миссис Клинч на Аппиевой дороге принял ее в потемках за Ужас А в другой вечер девка на Митстрит Заставлял ее повторять всякую похабень Она коверкала конечно Моя жожо называла свою Редко найдешь которая бы Хохо Пока не свыклась ей наверно ужасно когда заговорит с кемто а тот ноль внимания Поцеловала руку когда дал ей лишних два шиллинга Автоматы Нажмешь кнопку птичка чирикнет Но всетаки лучше б не называла сэр А какие у нее губы в темноте о Женатый мужчина со свободной девицей Вот что им самое приятное Отнять у другой ее мужчину Или хоть послушать про это Во мне нет такого Не стал бы связываться с чужой женой Объедки с чужой тарелкиКак у того типа в трактире хрящи непрожеванные А презерватив все еще у меня в бумажнике Изза чего половина проблем Но может же однажды стрястись правда Входишь Все приготовлено Я тут вздремнула Что Хуже всего начало Меняются как по волшебству едва увидят что не в их вкусеВопросы а вы любите грибы это значит знала когото кто Или а как вы думаете что он ктото там этим хотел сказать когда вдруг раздумал и перестал Но если уж ты всерьез так и говори мол хочу или в этом родеРаз уж решил И она Вроде обидь ее А потом загладь Сделай вид как будто чегото до смерти хочешь потом как бы откажись ради нее Это им льстит Наверняка она думает про когото другого все это время Ну и чтоКак выучилась думать с тех пор и думает не про того так про этогоПервый поцелуй все решает Роковой миг Пружинка какаято разжимается Вся сразу млеет хоть держится а по глазам видно Первый порыв не сравнить ни с чем Помнится до смертного часа У Молли это когда ее лейтенант Малви поцеловал за садами под Мавританской стеной Пятнадцать по ее словам Но уже груди были вполне А после крепко заснула После обеда в Гленкри когда ехали домой через гору Фезербед Скрипела зубами во сне Лордмэр на нее очень поглядывал Вэл Диллон АпоплектикВон она там с ними глядят фейерверк И у меня фейерверк Подымется ракетой опадет плетью А ребятишки похоже что близнецы только и ждут какихнибудь происшествий Хочется быть взрослыми Наряжаются в мамашины платья Будет время еще поймут как все на свете устроено А эта растрепанная чернушка с негритянскими губами Так и знал что она умеет свистеть Подходящие губы для этого Как у Молли Та шикарная шлюха у Джеммета странно отчего у нее такая вуаль короткая только до носаБудьте добры вы мне не скажете время Скажу в свое время гденибудь в укромном местечке Если толстые губы каждое утро сорок раз повторять пруды призмы И очень ласковая с младенцем Со стороны видно Конечно они чувствуют животных птиц маленьких детей Это по их частиКогда шла по пляжу не оглянулась Не снизошла Те приморские красоткиКрасивые у нее глаза ясные Это скорей белки создают впечатление зрачки не так важно А всетаки знала она что я Наверняка Так кошка вспрыгнет где не достать собаке и глядит на нее Женщины всегда остерегаются таких как наш Уилкинс в школе рисует Венеру а у самого так и выпячиваетсяМожет это и есть невинность Бедный кретин Жене его авансом полное обозрение Они в жизни не сядут на свежевыкрашенную скамью Все вокруг обшарят глазами Заглянут под кровать неизвестно зачем Все время ищут чегото остренького И сами востры как иголки Говорю Молли что этот встречный на углу Каффстрит был приятной наружности показалось он ей понравился а она отвечает у него же вместо руки протез И правда Как это у них так выходит Секретарша у Роджера Грина поднималась по лестнице через две ступеньки чтобы кто сзади видели бы всю канцеляриюПередается от отца то бишь от матери к дочери В крови у них Милли например сушит свои платочки на зеркале чтоб не гладить Лучшее место для рекламы если чтонибудь дамское это на зеркале Или когда послали ее забрать шотландскую шаль от Прескотта не забыть кстати про объявление для него на обратном пути спрятала сдачу в чулок Догадливая плутовкаНикто ее этому не учил Идет с какойнибудь ношей несет изящно легкоТакие мелочи привлекают мужчин Когда руки красные поднимет в воздух помашет чтобы кровь отлила Это кто ж научил тебя Никто Мне няня сказала Их и учить не надо Однажды когда годика три было уселась за туалетным столиком Молли на Западной Ломбардстрит уже съезжать собирались Я класивая Моллингар Кто знает Так на свете устроеноМолоденький студент Во всяком случае уже на своих ногах не то что другие Но та это штучка Боже до чего мокро Черт еще как Ножки кругленькие Чулочки прозрачные натянутые  вотвот лопнут Не то что то чучело АЭ Чулки гармошкой Или та что на Грэфтонстрит В белых ФуТолстомясаяВзорвалась с шумом шутиха разбрызгивая трескучие искры ТрахтарарахИ Сисси с Томми и Джеки побежали смотреть следом Эди с коляской а за ними и Герти огибая скалу Оглянется Оглянись Взгляни ПосмотрелаСловно почуяла Миленькая я видел твои Всевсе виделО господиПо крайней мере мне полегчало А то после Кирнана после Дигнама совсем сник Признателен я вам за облегченье Из Гамлета О господиТут все было сразу Возбуждает Когда она навзничь даже кончик языка засвербило Вскружат голову бедняжке Это он верно Мог бы худшего дурака свалять Лучше так чем трепаться ни о чем Тогда я тебе скажу все А пожалуй у нас и было какоето общение Кстати а вдруг она и есть Да нет они ее звали Герти Ну и что могло быть фальшивое имя как у меня и адрес Долфинсбарн липовыйОна звалась в девицах Джемма БраунИ приглашала в гости в АйриштаунЭто место меня навело на такие мысли Все они одним миром мазаны Об чулки вытирают перья Но мячик будто знал подкатился к ней Пуля сама цель знает Конечно я и в школето не умел кидать прямо Вечно куданибудь по кривой А грустно что им всегото отпущено дватри года а там пойдут кастрюли да скоро папины штаны будут Вилли впору да присыпка для малыша после того как высадили сделать аа Житье не сахар Зато спасительно Не даст сойти с пути истинного Естество Обмывают младенцев обмывают покойников Дигнам Вечно облеплены детишками Головенки с кокосовый орех еще мозжечок не затянулся как есть мартышки в пеленках кислое молоко разложившийся творожок Не надо было давать тому ребенку пустую соску От этого у них только газы Миссис Бьюфой Пьюрфой Стоило бы зайти в больницу Там ли еще та медсестра Каллан Иногда заходила приглядеть за ребенком когда Молли работала в кафе А этот молодой доктор ОХейр смотрю однажды она чистит ему пальто Когдато миссис Брин с миссис Дигнам были такие же вот на выданье Самое худшее по ночам как миссис Дугган рассказывала в Городском гербе Муж притащится на бровях от него смердит кабаком как от хорька А ты дыши всю ночь этим вонючим перегаромНаутро спросит никак я был под хмельком с вечера Но всетаки неправильно все валить на мужей Тут как аукнется так и откликнется Рыбак рыбака видит издалека Женщины не без греха тоже И вот уж тут Молли вне конкуренции Южная кровь Мавританская К тому же лицо фигура Руки ласкали ее пышные С другими никакого сравненья Запрет жену дома как скелет в гардеробе Позвольте вам представить мою И выплывает нечто неописуемое не знаешь каким словом назвать Всегда видно по жене где слабые места у мужчины С другой стороны судьба уж кого полюбишь У каждой пары есть свой секрет Иной давно пошел бы ко дну если бы жена его не взяла в ежовые рукавицы Или скажем жена  малявочка и муж  коротышка Созданы друг для друга А дети глядишь получатся вполне ничего Ноль да ноль единица Или еще богатый старик под семьдесят и рядом с ним юная краснеющая Женилсявздурился наутро каялся Фу как мокрое неприятно Липнет Хорошо не залуплен Давай отлепикаМ меИли наоборот сам каланча а жена ему до пупка В длинном и кратком варианте Огромный и крохотная Очень чтото странное с моими часамиНаручные вечно портятся Может есть какието магнитные волны от людей ведь именно в это время он Да я думаю сразу Кот со двора  мышки за пирушку Помню на Пилллейн я смотрел И что сейчас тоже магнетизм За всем скрывается магнетизм Земля например притягивает и сама притягивается Отсюда происходит движение А время Тоже понятно раз есть движение  на него нужно время Значит если гдето чтото там остановится так и вся эта астролябия постепенно Уж так устроеноМагнитная стрелка может сказать что делается на солнце на звездахПростой кусочек железа Когда подносишь магнит к железу Ближе БлижеХоп В точности женщина и мужчина Магнит и железо Молли и онРазоденутся строят глазки делают намеки позволяют себя разглядывать поддразнивают ну погляди хорошенько мужчина ты или нет и уж тут это как тяга чихнуть ножки глядишь глядишь и если ты только не деревяшкаХоп Прощайся со всемИнтересно как у нее самочувствие в тех местах Стыд это только на зрителя А так ее дырка на чулке больше волнует Молли голова вздернута губы сжаты это она на конной выставке изза того фермера в сапогах со шпорами На Западной Ломбардстрит были художники У одного замечательный голос Джульини так начинал Понюхайка мою мазню Как цветы И правдаФиалками Наверно от скипидара в краске Чего только не пускают в дело А когда этим занималась возила по полу шлепанцем чтобы они не услышалиМне кажется из них очень многие неспособны кончить Продолжают часамиЭто как будто по всему телу и сзади до поясницыПогоди ка Хмхм Точно Ее духи Вот она что махала рукой Оставляю на память чтобы ты думал обо мне когда я уже далеко под одеялом Что же это такое Гелиотроп Нет Гиацинт Хмм Пожалуй роза Такое она и должна любить Дешево и сердито но быстро портятся Молли поэтому предпочитает опопонакс Очень идет ей когда с маленькой добавкой жасминаКак низкие и высокие ноты в ее голосе Она с ним познакомилась на танцевальном вечере танец часов В жару запахи сильней Она была в своем черном на нем сохранились еще духи от прошлого раза Черное  хороший проводник Или плохой То же самое для света Может есть связь Например если спустишься в темный погреб Вообще загадочно Почему я только сейчас почуял Движется медленно но верно как и она сама Ведь это если представить миллионы и миллионы крохотных зернышек летят по воздухуИменно так Потому что Острова Пряностей кстати вспоминал сингалезов утром они чувствуются по запаху за много миль Сейчас скажу что это такое Это как тонкое кружево или паутинка что их окутывает с головы до ног тонкоетонкое как эта как ее кисея и они беспрерывно ткут это из себя тонкое как воздух всех цветов радуги сами того не чувствуя И на всем что она снимет с себя оно остается Подошвы ее чулок Теплая туфелька Корсет Панталоны слегка взмахнет ножкой чтобы сбросить Пока до встречи Кошка тоже любит зарыться в ее белье Узнал бы ее запах из тысячи И вода в ее ванне Напоминает землянику со сливками Интересно откуда идет Оттуда или из подмышек или между грудей Такое впечатление будто изо всех дырок и уголков Гиацинтовые духи делают на эфирных маслах кажется Мускусная крыса У ней под хвостом мешочек там зернышки и от каждого одного запах может стоять годами Собаки друг друга сзадиФук фук Наше почтение Вам также Как вам нюхается Фукфукфук Отлично благодарю Животных ведет чутье А присмотрись у нас то же самоеНапример некоторые женщины так отпугивают когда у них месячныеПодойдешь поближе почуешь такое что хоть топор вешай Похоже на чтоМожет на тухлую селедку Брр Просьба на этот газон не ступатьА они от нас может быть чуют мужской запах Хотя что там Перчатки пропахшие сигарой у Длинного Джона на столе Дыхание В нем только то что съел или выпил Не тут В смысле мужской запах Скорей связан с этим делом потому что у священников которые обходятся без у них другойЖенщины вьются вокруг них как мухи над патокой В алтарь не пускают  подберутся иначе любой ценой Запретный поп сладок Ах отче а вам не хотелось бы Пусть я буду первой Это както расходится по всему телу и все пропитывает Источник жизни И запах такой интересный странный Как сельдерейный соус А ну дайкаМистер Блум сунул свой нос Фукфук За Фукфук Пазуху своего жилетаМиндалем что ли Нет Лимоном Ах ты да это ж мылоА кстати кстати лосьонто Я помню еще чтото в голове было Не зашел и за мыло не заплатил Не люблю таскаться с бутылочками как та карга утром Хайнсу пора бы уже отдать три шиллинга Можно упомянуть просто Маэра чтоб напомнить Хотя если он поможет с тем объявлением Два и девять Что он теперь обо мне подумает Завтра зайти Сколько я должен вам Три девять Два и девять сэр Ах да В другой раз может не отпустить в кредит Вот так и теряют клиентов В трактирах та же историяИной дождется пока счет стал в локоть длиной и перекочует в другое заведение а это будет сторонкой обходитьОпять этот важный что уже проходил Каким его ветром Едва туда и уже обратно К ужину минута в минуту Гладкий так и лоснится недурно подзакусил Теперь наслаждается природой Его молитва после еды пройти пешком милю Наверняка счетец в банке казенная служба Можно пойти за ним по пятам поставить в глупое положение как меня

искушенные в учености и особливого почитания достойные за драгоценное убранство высокого их ума неизменно придерживались когда утверждали единодушно что при одинаковых прочих обстоятельствах процветание державы наивернейше свидетельствуется не блеском и пышностью а более мерою того сколь растут дани приносимые заботам о деле продолжения и умножения рода каковое терпя ущерб составляет

важности для общего блага сообразное с тою важностью приуготовленье потребно то посему решен был меж ними плана был ли он сочинен как бы в предвиденье либо по зрелом опыте то сказать затруднительно

духомь чашу ту осуши за здравие их понеже бе богатырския силы муж в похотениях своих И Леополд боярин иже бе муж честен паче всих гостей иже неколи седяху за трапезою премудрых и бе кроток и благ паче всих иже неколи под куры владычну руку соваху и бе поистине верен паче всих иже неколи служение госпоже благородней воздаяху чашу свою учтиво за здравие его осуши Долготерпению дивяся дарованному женамСе убо слово молвим о той дружине яже собрася ту помысл имея опойство велие учинити По всякой стране стола школяры седяху иже сии суть у ноша Диксон нарицаемый от Святыя Марии милосердныя и искренний его Линч и Мэден школяры учашеся врачеванию и оный вотчинник худороден глаголемый Ленехан и некто от Алба Лонги нарицаемый Кротерс и Стивен ун иже образ послушника имяше и в головах сего же стола седяще и Костело иже нарицаем бе Панч сиречь Пясть зане велику славу имяше яко витязь храбр и бе паче всих пиян разве едина уноши Стивена и паки и паки себе меда просяше и подле смиренный боярин Леополд Обаче ждаху они Малахию млада иже обещевася онуду прийти и елицы не хотяху благоутробия явити рекоша яко сей преступи слово свое И Леополд боярин с ними седе яко крепкое имяше приятелство к боярину Саймону и к оному Стивену иже бе сын его и такожде яко скорби его утишишася от странствий многих тем паче яко бе потчуем и почтен Жалость жалит его страсть стремит к странствию обаче не отыде оттудуСедяху бо тамо школяры хитроумны И нача слушати их беседу о сем еже есть праведно в делех ражения зане млад Мэден рече яко аще сице случится и то буде лютость велия аще ли жене умрети сие же времени некому минувшу поистине учинися в Хорна хоромех нецей жене от Ебланы яже ныне остави мир сей и в нощь преже кончины ея вси целители и врачи о том деле совет держаху И последе вси они рекли еже подобало ей жити вначале бо речено бысть яко да жене в болезни родити чад и помышляюще сице крепляхуся яко же млада Мэдена словеса истинны суть зане сей терзася яко оставили ю умретиИ немало беша сицевых и уный Линч с ними иже сумняшася аще зло имат ныне владычство в мире яко же и от века бе аще и безумнии инако мнят обаче закон ниже судии от сего избавления не умыслиша Бог дарует воздаяниеЕдва же сие проречено бысть и вси гласом единым возгласиша яко же ни николиже во имя Пречистыя Девы Матере жене подобает жити чаду же умрети Сие же помысливше начаша стязатися яро о сем взискании овый являше разумения овый же точию от подпития яко же оный вотчинник худороден Ленехан зело борз бысть егда кому надобе добавляти пива и сице веселие их не убываше И се убо Мэден млад им яви яко вся сия быша и егда глагола яко она преставися и ея муж честен святыя веры ради и по слову некоего паломника и инока и от обета иже дал бе святому Ултану Арбраканскому не мог ея кончины прияти то их великая скорбь объя И на то уный Стивен сице глагола Роптание почтенные сие есть вещь чястая у мирян Чадо же и мати оба ныне прославляете своего Творца ов в бездне мрачне ова же в огне очистителнемь И за то Ему от нас грамерси Обаче како тии все души яже Господь яко возможнии сотвори и мы еженощно их в невозможная учиняем еже есть грех против Духа Святаго Бога Истинна Владыки и Живота Подателя Помните бо рече яко же вся услаждения наша мимотекуща суть Для тварей малых иже суть внутри нас мы точию ради них есмы и такожде натура разве нас замысления иные имяше И се вопроси Диксон Панча Костело аще ведаеши яковы те замысления суть Обаче оный Панч зело пиян бе и точию единое изрыгаше яко аще удача будет ему да похоти своей волю дати и тогда каяждо жена чрез него чести бы лишилася аще случися то мужняя жена или девица или наложница Кротерс же из Алба Лонги нача песню про зверя единорога юже сочини млад Малахия яко сей зверь единожды в тысящу лет рогом своим кончаше и прочий во время сие великая насмевания творяще над ним во свидетели призывая уд святаго Футиния еже горазд он вся и всяческая свершити яже человеку возможна И такс смеяхуся и играху разве токмо млада Стивена и Леополда боярина иже ни единожды не рассмеяся ради некоего чюднаго душерасположения еже не хотя оставити и такожде зане жалостию снедашеся до кийждо жены имущей во чреве ничтоже разсуждая кто и кде она бе Стивен же млад нача с надмением глаголати о матери Церкви яже изгна его из лона своя и о догматех и канонех и о Лилит яже абортом покровителница и о сем яко же зачатие учиняется ветром семени сверкающаго или от лобзания упырскаго уста ко устом или чрез действие запада яко Виргилий рече или чрез смрад цветка луннаго или яко аще она возлежи с женою юже пред тем муж поя   или по случаю омовения яко же непщеваху Авероес и Маймонид Моисей И такожде рече яко душа человеческая к концу другаго месяца вдуновляется и яко во всех и всегда наша Святая Матерь окормляет души матерь же земная ничтоже есть яко точию самка приносящая приплод по образу скотию и се убо подобает по каноном ей сгинути сице бо рече сей иже рыбаря печать емлет сам Петр благословен на его же камении созиждена Святая Церковь на вся времена И яко вси они тамо бяху брака не восприявыи вопрошаху боярина Леополда аще случилось бе сице и тогда еда воля его была бысть дозволити толикое для нея бедство яко живот под прещение ввергнута дабы живот спасти И он яко хотя отвещати со блюдением и благоугодно для всех и емля в руку челюсть свою рече по своему обычаю лицемерие еже елико то ведомо ему иже познание натуры искони любяще елико мирянину то возможно и в согласии с разумением своим о сицевом толико редкостном случае и то есть благо яко же зде матерь Церковь вкупе мзду емлет и за рождение и за смерть и сицевым образом вопрошания их избеже искусно И рече Диксон сие есть сущая истина накажи мя Господь и слово сие имат во чреве аще не я блуждаю зело Сие же услыша млад Стивен возрадовася и возгласи яко крадущий у беднаго дает взаймы Господу зане буий зело бываше егда пиян и еже он ныне в сицевом образе бе и то уявися вскореОбаче сии словеса не извлекоша боярина Леополда из великой туги его зане ужас вселяюще вопли жен иже в муках ражения яко прежде его терзаху и такожде вспоминаше яко добра его жена Мэрион ему роди младенца мужска пола и той на единадесятый день умре и никтоже бе муж искусен его спасти толико жестока судба бысть И злая сия утрата великою кручиною сердце жены снедаше и ради погребения младенца она ему сотвори душегреечку вязену зело красну из шерсти агнчей от лучшаго агнца из стада боящися яко измерзнет бо тогда бе зимы преполовение и се ныне боярин Леополд иже не имяше чада мужеска пола яко наследника по себе взираше на него иже сын его друга бысть и печалишеся зело о сгибших своих благых и се убо скорбя понеже несть у него сына толико любезна и добля о нем же вси глагола яко имат дары мнози не мене удручася понеже млад Стивен беспутное имат житие с оными опоями и добро свое с блудницами расточаетО ту же пору млад Стивен чаши все наполни кои пусты стояху и се убо пития точию малая толика осталась бе аще иже благоразумнии не заслоняху доступы свои от него иже их преусердно понуждаше и за верховнаго понтифекса моляся возгласи заздравную чашу о викарии Христове глаголя яко же сей есть и викарий Брэйский И рече да убо подъемлем ныне фиял сей и испием его мед сие бо истинно есть не тела частица моего но души моея воплощение Да оставите преломляти хлеб хлебом единым живущим И да не убоитеся любыя нужды сие бо утешит вящше нежели то устрашит Воззрите жеИ се им яви златицы дани блескающе и златокузнец грамоты и тому всея цены два фунта и девятнадесять шилингов и рече яко получи сие за песнь юже он сложи И зело возликовали они зряще сицевые богатства зане ту бе преже великая в денгах скудость И сице глагола им то всем мужем ведомо еже пустыни времене воздвизают дворцы вечности Яко да сие навыкнути Желанья ветр ломает терн колючий обаче напоследь процветет из терниев роза на крестном древе времене И сему вонмите Во чреве жены слово плоть бысть обаче во дусе создателя всяка преходяща плоть слово бысть еже не прейдетСие же есть

Бернардус рече яко же дано Ей    сиречь всемогущество предстателства понеже она есть вторая Ева яже нас вызволила яко и Августин рече а та первая яже нам баба есть с ней же нас связует чредою

покровитель расторжений счастливых всех несчастливых браков                        иносущие  единосущие токмо ни в коем случае не ущербносущие И ту вси возопиша яко сие есть слово хулно зело Зачатие без радости тако рече сей рождение без мучений тело без изъяна и чрево без вздутия Да оставим бессрамником сему покланятися с верою и усердием Мы же противоборствующе и противоречуще прямо противное проповедуемПо сих же Панч Костело брязне кулаком по столу и зача велегласно вопияти злосрамну песнь Стабу Стабела про девку юже обрюхатил некий удалый молодец в земле Немецкой и егда распеваше Первые три месяцы вси болезна бяше  то Квигли сиделица рекла им из дверей гневне нишкните и устыдитеся и то ли не бысть благозаконно еже напомни им яко же сия бе ея послушания вся ту в доброчинии содержати дондеже сам Эндрю господин приидет понеже она вельми благострадаше аще сие непотребное козлогласование чести ея служения не бы могло поврещи Она же бе жена печална и ветха денми обличия степенна и нрава благочестивна в ризах темных яко же и подобает к лицу ея еже уныло и морщиновато и увещания ея не бысть втуне понеже оного Панча Костело вси абие нача испонашати и лаяти одни с чинною жестостию иные же тычки отпуская с грозными улещениями обаче вси браняху его чума де сего разрази болвана да какова он диавола хощет и ты де грубля и ты де мелкота шут гороховой ты еси лиходей ты еси требуха свиная бусурманско отродье под забором ражден ты еси измет дабы заткнути пияну околесину юже отрыгаше овый пифик яко наказание Божие а добрый Леополд боярин емуже ведом бе цвет благодушия майоран тихий такожде наставляше яко час сей наисвятей есть от всех и наипаче заслужен наисвятым быти В Хорна бо хоромех подобает покойКоротко сказать помянутая дистракция достойную возымела резолюцию и посем Диксон магистр что от Марии Экклской с приятностию разсмехнувшись полюбопытствовал из каковых резонов юный Стивен не восприя иноческие обеты и на то последний отвечал так послушание во утробе целомудрие же во гробе а бедность аще и нежеланна да непрестанна Магистр же Ленехан здесь заметил что он зело наслышан о неких нечестивых деяниях и как то утверждают толки им слышанные сгубил он лилею добродетели доверившейся ему особы дамского пола сие же не что иное как совращение малолетных и при таковой вести все живейше возликовали веселяся и поднимая кубки за грядущее его отцовство Однако же тот с пылкостию возразил де истина гораздо противна их поклепаниям для того что есть он извечный сын и нерушимо хранящий девство Сие изрядно прибавило веселия их сердцам и принялись они поминать свадебный обряд о коем он прежде поведал им и тот обряд превеликия куриозности жрецами есть отправляем на острове Мадагаскаре свершается же в нем одежд совлечение у новобрачной и девства отьятие и у нея одежды белого и шафранного цвета а у жениха белого и шарлахова возле ложа брачна возжигаются свечи и фимиамы курятся клирики распевают Аллилуйа и тому купно гимн       и с таковым церемониалом учиняется лишение ее девства Он же в ответ преподал им дивну хотя невелику эпиталаму из Трагедии девы коя принадлежит перу магистра Флетчера и магистра Бомонта преискусных сиих поэтов и равномерно живописует соединение возлюбленных В постель в постель таков ее был рефрен сопровождение же к нему исполнять подобало в сообразной позиции на спинете То была песнь прелестна и сладкозвучна и полна необоримой любострастной истомы для юных амантов коим благовонные светильники паранимфов освещают восшествие их на четырехногий феатр амуров супружеских Славная была парочка промолвил возвеселяся Диксон магистр однако послушайте меня юный сэр не лучше ль было им прозываться Фаллос и Бабонт сиречь бабец мнится бо мне из такового союза великая бы произошла приятность Юный же Стивен отвечал что буде не изменяет память ему имели они сообща одну девицу из веселого дома и с тою амурам предавались поочередно поелику в те времена жизнь била ключом и обычай страны оное одобрял Нет большия любви рече как если кто положит жену свою со другом своим Иди же и совершай по сему Так а коли не так тем хуже говаривал Заратустра в бытность свою доцентом французской любви в Оксбордельском Университете и доселе не нарождался под луной человек коему род людской толико был бы обязан Введи пришлеца в башню замка твоего и едва ли того избежишь чтобы досталась тебе кровать похуже    И все ответят миром аминь Вспомяни Эрин твои колена и дни твои древний яко еси отринул мя и слово мое и отверзл пришлецу врата мои да творити блуд при моих глазах и утучнятися и расширятися яко Израиль И посему согрешил еси против света и мя Господа твоего соделал рабом рабов Обратися же обратися клан Милли не позабудь мя о семя Милезиево Векую сотвори предо мною сию мерзость яко предпочел еси мене торговца ялапою и от мене отреклся еси пред римлянином и пред индийцем темноглаголивым с ним же возлежали любострастно дщери твои Воззри же ныне народ мой на землю обетованную от Хорива и от Нево от Фасги и от Рогов Хеттийских на землю текущу млеком и пивом Ты же мя млеком горьким вспоил луну мою и солнце мое ты угасил навеки И навеки едина покинул еси мя на путях моих иже суть пути горести и лобзание тлена положил на уста мои Сия же тма внутренняя так продолжал он речь свою премудростию семидесяти толковников не была просвещенна ниже хотя бы помянута Восток бо с вышних иже сокруши врата адовы наела тую тму коя была предвечнаОбыкновение умаляет свирепства яко же Туллий рече о возлюбленных своих Стоиках и Гамлету принцу отец его отнюдь не являет язвы иже от пламене чистилища Непрозрачность в жизни полдневный час воистину есть казнь египетская каковая и составляет ночам предрождества и послеуспения доподлинное их  и  И как завершения и концы всего сущего в некой мере и неким образом соответственны истокам и началам его так подобное же многоликое соответствие что от рожденья движет и направляет рост наш завершаясь ретрогрессивной метаморфозою тем нисхожденьем и убываньем к финалу каковое приятно ладу натуры присуще и нашему подлунному бытиюСтарухи сестры втаскивают нас в жизнь мы вопим подрастаем резвимся обнимаемся сходимся разлучаемся хиреем помираем  и вновь они склоняются над нами умершими В начале спасенный из вод древнего Нила средь тростников в плетеной зыбке из прутьев в конце же  горная пещера тайное погребение под совозглашенья орла и пардуса И как ни единому из смертных не ведом тафоса его топос ниже будет ли возвещено нам посем путь держати во Тофет или во град Едем и таковым же образом утаено егда будет нам в задняя наша зримо из каковых дальных пределов чтойность ктойности нашей почерпнула свою причинностьТут Панч Костелло не утерпев взревел громогласно   однако же тот с пущею зычностию к ним воззвал любуйтеся каков премудрость построила себе дом сей свод толико прочен и древен обширен и величав хрустальный Творца дворец ухожен как стеклышко и тому грошик кто отыщет горошекВзгляни каков дворец построил умник БакНайдешь ты там вино и пиво и табакВ предивном погребе где Бак разбил бивакОле устрашающий треск снаружи грозный рокот и рык Громогласно ошую Тор громыхнул млатовержец распалясь ярым гневом И се грянула буря страхом его полня сердце И Линч магистр остерег его дабы укротил он свои балясы и блядословия понеже сам бог прогневался за адовы его поганства и шпынства И оный храбрец похвалявшийся надменно во мгновение ока стал бледен и съежился в виду всех речь коя столь зычно и вольно лилась дотоле стала тиха и смирна на диво и сердце аки заяц заметалось в клетке груди его едва он почуял сей бури мощь Иные тут зачали потешатися иные глумитися над ним Панч же Костелло с великим рвением налег вново на пиво а Ленехан магистр божился и клялся в том от него не отстати и он был вправде куда как спор на всяк пустяк и безделицу Однако тут бравый наш фанфарон вскричал что де видно Никтоотец старикан сам обретается в подпитии и на то де ему плевать а он яко питух верха никомуже даст над собою Сим точию тщился он отчаяние свое уняти яко труся дрожал он в Хорна хоромах И как сказал немедля и опростал кубок свой спеша любыми благами упавший дух поддержати ибо паки и пуще раскатилось по небесам громыхание а Мэдден магистр кой в иные поры учинялся сугубо набожен при сем раскате отпусти под ребра ему тычка а магистр Блум близ фанфарона седяще и страхи его великие желая утишити зача ободряти его всемерно толкуя что де все громы сии точию звук пустой истечение влаги в грозочреватом облаце сущей воззри де и убедися и вся сия совершается яко предуказано феноменам натурыОднако победися ли юного Бахвала страх тыми Доброхота речами Никак понеже угнездися в груди его заноза Горечь рекомая и тоя занозы избытися речами не можно И се убо не имел он набожства присущего одному ниже благоразумия отпущенного другому Истинно так не имел отнюдь елико бы ни желал обоя имети Но ужли не мог он приложить тщания дабы вново яко во дни юности своея обрести тую бутыль Святость именем коя прежде была ему толико душепитательна Отнюдь нет для того что не снизошла на него Благодать обрести бутыль ту А что же слышал он в тех раскатах глас бога Плодорода либо по слову оного Доброхота точию феномена пустой звукСлышал Обаче истинно как мог он не слышати разве закупорил себе плотно трубу Разумение рекомую сего же не содеял отнюдь Ведь преотлично было зримо ему чрез трубу сию яко пребывает в земле Феномена где и предстоит ему в некий день умерети коль скоро являет он собою подобно прочим точию преходящий зрак А не приял ли он сию участь умерети и исчезнути подобно прочим Инде ни в какую не приял сего аще и должен быв ниже приял умножати зраки себе подобны по обычаю яко у мужей с женами о том же заповедал им Феномен чрез книгу Закон Не ведал он ничесоже про землю иную глаголемую ВеруйвМя землю обетованную идеже царствует царь Блаженство ныне и присно и вовеки веков и несть тамо смерти ниже рождения и несть замужства и материнства и собраны будут тамо вси кто верует в то То правда Благочтив ему сказывал про землю ту а Целомудр указал и путь в оную однако случися тут яко стала ему пути сего поперек некая блудница зело прелестна назвалась же она ПташкавРуках и льстивыми речами уклонила его с пути истинна глаголя Эй красавчик а заверника сюда покажу райское местечко и се ласкательствами и лестию залучила его в вертеп свой прозываемый ГнездышковКустах а сведущими глаголемый Плотское ПохотениеСего то и алкало то сборище засевшее Чертог Материнства и доведися им повстречати сию блудницу ПташкувРуках а была она гнездилище всех язв и чудищ и козней диаволских и они бы готовы из кожи лезти точию бы ея достигнута и познати Нащот же ВеруйвМя они возглашали яко сие есть точию мудрование и в помыслах своих никогда оного не имели понеже первое ГнездышковКустах куда она всех заманивала было столь прелестно местечко и убрано четырьмя подушечками и на тех подушечках четыре ж билетика на коих выставлены сии слова Рядышком Бочком Рачком Язычком и второе понеже та язва Сифилла и чудища их нимало не устрашали коль скоро был у них щит надежен Презерватив из бычьего пузыря а вотретьях понеже и козни диаволские сиречь зарождение Отпрыска такожде чаяли они отразить тем щитом ему же иное прозвание Детогуб И се убо

сборище поистине ты в гибельном заблуждении понеже был то глас бога и он исполняся великого гнева уже готов подъяти десницу свою дабы расточить души их в прах за их хулы и расточения семени кои перечили его заповеди пламенно плодитися призывавшейИтак четверг июня шестнадцатого дня Патк Дигнам жертва апоплексического удара лежит в земле и после жестокой засухи хвала Господу наконец раздождило барочник привез торф проплыв миль пятьдесят или около того и говорил что посевы не всходят поля засохли глядят уныло и отменно смердят будь то в низинах или на взгорье Трудно дышать и все молодые побеги погибли начисто не имея капли дождя столь долго что в прежние годы никто не упомнит подобного У роз бутоны все почернели и вспузырились а на холмах одна жухлая трава и сухой кустарник который займется от первой искры Как все твердят в один голос тот страшный ураган что разорил всю страну в прошлом феврале сущий пустяк в сравнении с такою напастью Однако нынче как было уже помянуто после захода солнца и при том же западном ветре стали малопомалу сбираться крупные набухшие облака и сведущие в чтеньи небес мерили их взглядом потом ближе к ночи запоблескивали зарницы а еще позже в одиннадцатом уже часу раздался мощный долгий удар грома и вмиг все кинулись врассыпную по домам под дымящимся ливнем мужчины  защищая соломку шляп платками или какими тряпицами женского же пола особы  припрыгивая и подбирая юбки повыше как только начало лить Где только что была сушь как в Сахаре по Илиплейс Бэгготстрит Дьюкслаун а оттуда по Меррион Грин на Холлсстрит мчался поток воды и повсюду кругом не было уже ни одного портшеза ни одного экипажа или фиакра однако гром больше не повторялся после того удара Против дверей достопочтенного судьи фицгиббона коему надлежало заседать с мистером Хили стряпчим насчет земель колледжа МалМаллиган благороднейший из благородных вышед от мистера Мура литератора прежде паписта однако ставшего добрым Вильямитом как про то слышно натолкнулся на АлБаннона с короткой стрижкой какая модна сейчас наряду с вечерними плащами из зеленого твида а тот только что вернулся в город почтовою каретой из Моллингара где его кузен и брат МалМ пробудут еще месяц до свСвитина и спрашивает как его сюда занесло он к себе домой а он к Эндрю Хорну его там ждут опрокинуть стаканчик как он доложил но только ему охота порассказать про одну телочку с норовом формы не по годам развиты слегка даже толстомяса а дождь между тем все поливал да поливал их так что оба они прямехонько к Хорну Там ЛеопБлум из газеты Кроуфорда приятно заседал с ватагой бездельников мастаков повздорить и покричать были там Диксон мл студиозус от Скорбящей Матери Божией ВинЛинч шотландского происхождения молодчик Вил Мэдден ТЛенехан в глубокой печали изза одной чистокровки коей доверился он на скачках и Стивен ДЛеопБлум там оказался изза усталости сморившей его но сейчас уже вновь воспрянул а прошлую ночь приснился ему весьма причудливый сон о его даме миссис Молль в красных домашних туфлях и в турецких шальварах а это как сведущие полагают к перемене и миссис Пьюрфой была там же будучи туда принята по прошенью своего брюха теперь она бедное создание мается распростершись уже два дня после срока и все не может родить повитухи в отчаянии от рисового отвара ее тошнит а он обезвоживает лучше всего дыхание тяжкое затрудненное но судя по тому как толкается младенец  отменный здоровячок дал бы ей только Бог разрешиться Я слышал это у нее уж девятый а последнему подрезали ноготки на Благовещенье значит ему тогда исполнялся годик и как и те трое тоже все вскормленные грудью он у нее умер и записан красивыми буквами в Библии короля Якова Ее мужу с лихвою пятьдесят он методист но ходит к причастию а в погожие деньки его всегда видят по воскресеньям с двумя сынишками возле Баллокской гавани он там удит сайду и камбалу на удочку с тяжелой катушкой с берега или с лодкиплоскодонки старается забрасывать легонько и как я слыхивал имеет весьма недурной улов Итак словом отменный ливень натура сызнова ожила и доброго можно ждать урода хоть всякие кудесники предрекают что вслед за ветром и за водою придет огонь коль скоро по пророчеству календаря Малахиитакже дошло до меня и мистер Рассел состряпал сего же толка прорицание с хиндустанского наречия для своей крестьянской газетки сии три стихии всегда вместе но это одна тень на плетень для старых бабок и несмышленышей отнюдь без никакого резона хотя порой они со своими чудасами бывает и угодят разом в самую истину никому не ведомо какТут поднялся в конце стола Ленехан вознамерившись рассказать про письмо в вечернем листке и сделал вид будто усердно разыскивает его у себя он клялся и божился чтоде оно волнует его безмерно но сдавшись на уговоры Стивена бросил поиски и с большой резвостью последовал приглашению присесть рядом Он был весьма разбитной господинчик строил из себя рубахупарня да валял дурака и когда заходило дело о женщинах лошадях или о свежем скандальчике случался он всегда тут как тут По правде говоря состояние его было скудным и время он проводил большей частью по трактирам и по кофейням в компании вербовщиков кучеров тунеядцев посыльных подмастерьев жучков со скачек девок уличных и бордельных и прочей избранной публики а иной раз просиживал и ночь напролет с подвернувшимся сыщиком иль судейским выуживая у него еще тепленькие сплетни в промежутках меж возлияниями Трапезовал он в самых захудалых обжорках но хоть и доставалось ему порой одно месиво из объедков или тарелка требухи на последний родимый шестипенсовик язык его никогда не давал поблажки унынию и от иного соленого словца подхваченного от шлюхи или еще неведомо от кого все так и покатывались как одержимые Другой же из бывших там Костелло услышав их разговор спросил а что это стихи или какая история Не угадал Фрэнк таково было его имя отвечал тот это про ирландских коров которых ведено забивать по причине чумы Ну и хрен с ними говорит он и подмигивает по мне хоть провались они все со своей собачьей говядиной Тут вот у нас в жестянке самолучшая рыба какую отродясь лавливали и с великим радушием он им протянул стоявшие рядом кильки к которым уж давно подбирался ради того и затеяв весь хитроумный маневр поскольку брюхо у него совсем подвело    выражается затем Фрэнк на французском наречии он прежде служил в подручных у некоего виноторговца имевшего склад в Бордо и пофранцузски изъяснялся как джентльмен Сей Фрэнк с самого нежного возраста был записной шалопай и его отец околоточный с превеликим трудом понуждал его ходить в школу учиться грамоте да разбирать карту после же этого он поместил его в университет изучать механику однако тут малый совсем закусил удила как молодой жеребец и был в те поры знаком с судебными исполнителями и с ночными сторожами лучше чем со своей наукою Одно время подумывал он в актеры потом в маркитанты потом в шулера потом глядишь пропадает на петушиных боях да медвежьих травлях а там ему загорится на моряокеаны или шататься по дорогам с цыганами которые то сынка украдут у какогонибудь помещика то стянут белье развешанное служанкой а то курице свернут шею притаясь за забором Он пускался в похождения столько раз сколько у бога заповедей и всякий раз возвращался несолоно хлебавши к своему отцу околоточному и тот при каждой такой оказии неизменно проливал не менее пинты слез Как восклицает мистер Леопольд скрестив руки и непритворно будучи озабочен неужели же все они пойдут на убой Я протестую заявляет он я видел их не далее как сегодня утром их гнали на ливерпульские пароходы Я не могу поверить что это настолько непоправимо заявляет онПритом же он был человек многоопытный по сей части насчет племенного скота телят боровков шерстных барашков ибо тому несколько лет служил он клерком у мистера Джозефа Каффа почтенного торговца каковой скупал скот на фермах и себе не в убыток им торговал невдалеке от подворья мистера Гэвина Лоу на Прашастрит Я расхожусь в этом с вами заявляет онГораздо вероятней что тут всетаки не чума а какоелибо бронхиальное заболевание или актиномикоз Мистер Стивен слегка задетый однако же с совершенной учтивостью ответил ему что сомнения невозможны ибо у него имеются депеши от главного хвостокрута императорского двора с выражениями благодарности за гостеприимство и тот сюда направляет доктора Эпизоотьева славнейшего укротителя коров во всей Московии с парой бутылей снадобья дабы взять быка за рога Да уж полноте вмешался мистер Винцент привыкший говорить напрямик Он сам живо попадет на рога коли свяжется с ирландским быком Ирландским по имени и по нраву с чувством подчеркнул мистер Стивен расплеснув свое пиво Ирландский бык в английской посудной лавке Уловил вашу мысль говорит мистер Диксон Это наверняка тот бык с изумрудным кольцом в носу которого прислал на наш остров фермер Николай самый лихой удалец из всех скотоводов Твоя правда отзывается через стол мистер Винцент и клянусь бычьим ухом говорит он никогда еще не было такого гладкого тучного быка середь серящих на трилистник Рога у него были на загляденье шкура золотой масти из ноздрей теплый пар так что на острове все женщины побросали скалки и прялки да устремились за ним увешивая его быкородие венками из маргариток А что толку говорит мистер Диксон ведь перед тем как его послать фермер Николай будучи сам евнух приказал и его выхолостить в наилучшем виде препоручив операцию коллегии докторов которые по известной части все как один были под стать Николаю Так что теперь ступай говорит он и делай все что тебе прикажет Гарринечистый мой двоюродный братец и принимай фермерское благословение и с этими словами он весьма звучно шлепнул его по мягким частям Однако же тот шлепок вместе с благословением ему сослужил службу замечает мистер Винцент ведь тот видно в утешение выучил его койчему получше утраченного коль скоро до сего дня и жена и девица и вдова и черница все в один голос скажут что им куда желанней нашептывать ему на ушко в темном загончике да получать помазание в затылочек его длинным пресвятым языком чем миловаться хоть с самым распригожим молодцем всех четырех царств ИрландииЕще один из них вставляет здесь свое слово И нарядили они его в кружевную рубашку и в нижнюю юбку так он говорит а сверху в палантин и в кружевные манжеты на лбу приладили завиток умастили все тело его амброй и на каждом повороте дороги соорудили для него стойла с золотыми кормушками полными наилучшего сена какое только было на рынке дабы он мог и отоспаться и опростаться к вящему своему довольству Но к этому времени отец верных так они его называли столь разжирел что уже едва мог добраться до пастбища Чтобы помочь тому хитроумные наши девы и дамы измыслили приносить ему пищу в своих передниках и когда он вполне насыщал свое брюхо то подымался иногда на задние ноги являя высокородным дамам вся тайная и издавал мычанье и рев на бычьем своем наречии и все они вторили ему Сущая истина подхватил другой и стал он до того привередлив что уже требовал чтобы нигде в стране ничего не росло кроме одной зеленой травы ему на потребу все остальные цвета он терпеть не мог и потому водрузили в самой середине острова на холме печатное объявление гласившее волею Гарринечистого да будут зело зелены все зеленя что на земле зеленеют Мистер же Диксон добавляет и едва случится ему зачуять скотокрада в Роскоммоне или в глуши Коннемары или прознать что какойнибудь землепашец в Слайго засеял полгрядки рапсом или горчицей как он тут же в бешеной ярости готов мчаться через весь остров чтоб вырвать рогами с корнем что там росло и все это волей ГарринечистогоПоначалу они не ладили говорит мистер Винцент Гарринечистый посылал фермера Николая ко всем чертям и называл его хозяином бардака с семью шлюхами и сулил что он еще разберется с его темными делишками Я эту скотину заставлю понюхать чем в аду пахнет так он ему сулил с помощью вот этого доброго уда что мне от отца достался Но както вечером говорит мистер Диксон когда Гарринечистый скреб свою королевскую шкуру сбираясь отобедать после гребных гонок где он конечно всех победил а правила там были что он вместо весел гребет лопатами а все остальные  вилами он вдруг у себя обнаружил разительное сходство с быком и взявши замусоленную книжицу со старыми сказками что у него хранилась в кладовке с несомненностью там открыл что происходит он по побочной линии от знаменитого призового быка римлян   что на чистейшей кухонной латыни обозначает босс всем быкам После чего продолжает мистер Винцент Гарринечистый собравши всех царедворцев окунает свою башку в коровью поилку и вынув ее оттуда объявляет им новое свое имя Затем не успев обсохнуть облачается в старую юбку и в кофту которые остались от бабки и спешит покупать учебник бычьего языка только он все равно не сумел выучить ни одного слова кроме местоимения первого лица но зато уж его крупно переписал и вызубрил назубок и выходя погулять всегда прихватывал с собой мел чтобы писать его везде где понравится на камне на столике в трактире на тюках с хлопком на поплавках удочек Одним словом он и ирландский бык стали в такой тесной дружбе как штаны с задницей Статьто стали говорит мистер Стивен а кончилось дело тем что мужчины на острове увидав что на помощь им не рассчитывать раз все женщины неблагодарные отвернулись сколотили здоровый плот загрузились на него со всеми узлами и потрохами установили попрямей мачты набрали на снасти команду развернули переднюю шкаторину легли в дрейф залили горючего за воротничок уставили нос ниже ватерлинии выбрали якорь положили руль лево по борту подняли пиратский флаг рявкнули тройное ура запустили пыхтелку отпихнули свой тузик и поехали переоткрывать Америку И по такому случаю заключает мистер Винцент ихний боцман сочинил лихую припевкуЭх папа Петр пусть жрет пометИ все такое прочееНе успели студенты закончить описанной выше апологии как на пороге явился достойный знакомец наш мистер Мэйлахи Маллиган в обществе одного своего приятеля которого он только что повстречал Имя сему последнему было Баннон Алек и прибыл он в город нынешним вечером имея желание купить себе чин прапорщика или поручика в ополчении да понюхать гденибудь пороху Мистер Маллиган весьма учтиво высказал сему одобрение заметив что не усматривает здесь ущерба собственному прожекту каковой он задумал ради искоренения того зла о коем выше было трактовано И с этими словами он передал на обозрение собравшимся несколько карточек из твердого картона что были заказаны им у мистера Квиннелла печатника и несли следующую надпись оттиснутую красивыми и крупными литерами Мистер Мэйлахи Маллиган Оплодотворитель и Инкубатор Остров Лэмби Помянутым прожектом как он открыл им определялось ему отойти от праздных увеселений подобных тем коим неумеренно предавались сэр Франт Вертопрах и сэр Мямли Рохли дабы всецело себя отдать благороднейшему занятию на каковое особливо рассчитано и наше телесное устройство Что же дружище порасскажика об этом пригласил мистер Диксон Уж я уверен тут не обойдется без девок Да присаживайтесь оба в ногах правды нет Приняв сие любезное приглашение мистер Маллиган приступил к рассказу о своем предприятии Как поведал он слушателям оная идея его посетила впервые при размышлении о причинах неплодия кои равно происходят от препон умышленных и от неумышленных притом же первые в свой черед семейными распрями либо скупою расчетливостью чинимы бывают последние же могут происходить либо от врожденных изъянов либо от благоприобретенных наклонностей По его признанию душа его исполнялась скорби когда видел он как лишают брачное ложе драгоценнейшей его службы а если к тому же вспомнить о преизбытке нежных созданий с кругленьким вдовьим капиталом что станет добычею мерзких бонз прячущих светоч свой под сосудом в какойнибудь угрюмой обители иль губящих цвет своих женских чар в объятиях иного наглого красавчика владея между тем ключами несказанного счастья иль приносящих в жертву бесценный пола своего перл когда кругом несть числа статным кавалерам весьма охочим амуриться  все это так уверил он их терзало сердце его нещадно Стремясь сие нестроение устранить а происходило оно как то уяснилось ему от подавления внутреннего жара обсудил он дело свое с людьми сведущими и достойными с пристрастием разобрался в материях привходящих и сопредельных и надумал приобрести в вечную собственность ленное владение остров Лэмби у нынешнего его владельца лорда Толбота де Малахайда дворянина из ториев которого не весьма жаловала правящая наша партия Полагал же он там устроить национальную оплодотворительную ферму под названием Омфал вытесать и воздвигнуть на ней обелиск наподобие египетских и самым неукоснительным образом предоставлять услуги по оплодотворению любым особам женского пола без различья сословий какие будут направляться к нему желая исполнить что определено им натуроюДело не ради дохода заявил он за труд свой не будет он взимать ни единого пенса Бедная кухарка и роскошная леди равно обретут в нем своего мужчину коль скоро сложение их и темперамент с довольным красноречием убеждают склониться к их просьбам В рассуждении же питания он им представил как будет держаться рациона сугубо состоящего из лакомых клубней а также рыбы и кроликов поскольку у сих последних весьма плодовитых грызунов мясо как нельзя полезней для его цели будь то тушеное или жареное на вертеле особливо если добавить мускатный цвет и толику кайенского перца Произнеся сию проповедь с жаром и вдохновением мистер Маллиган проворно снял со своей шляпы платок коим пытался он ее защитить Как без труда угадывалось оба друга были застигнуты дождем и сколь ни резво ретировались они в укрытие однако успели преизрядно намокнуть чему свидетельством была нижняя часть костюма мистера Маллигана каковой домотканая серая материя сделалась пегой в яблокахПрожект между тем принят был благосклонно и снискал непритворные похвалы от всех слушателей одного выключая мистера Диксона что от Марии Скорбящей последний же с коварной любезностью осведомился не помышляет ли заодно мистер Маллиган возить воду в ближнюю речку Лиффи Однако тут мистер Маллиган завоевал на свою сторону просвещенную часть братии подходящею цитатой из классиков поскольку в той цитате какою хранилась она в его памяти мнил он найти изящное и вместе весомое подкрепление своим видам                           а что до более неотесанных то их он убедил помощию уподоблений из животного царства кои для их желудков были куда съедобней про лань с еленем в диких лесах да утку с селезнем во дворе фермыИмея весьма высокое мнение о благородстве манер своих и о щегольстве наряда да и вправде будучи завидно лепообразен многослов наш обратился засим к обозрению своего платья приправляя оный обзор сварливыми осужденьями нежданных причуд натуры между тем как собравшиеся щедро расточали хвалы услышанному прожекту Молодой джентльмен его друг пребывая в нежном волнении от приятного похождения ему недавно выпавшего на долю не мог долго устоять и немедля пустился выкладывать о том похождении ближайшему своему соседу Мистер же Маллиган обратя взгляд к столу вопросил для кого тут столько хлебов и рыб затем заметил он незнакомца и поклонившись ему учтиво промолвил Прошу вас скажите сэр не привела ли вас сюда нужда в услугах повивального ремесла какие могли бы мы оказать вам В ответ последний сердечно благодарил его держась однако с достоинством и без панибратства и сообщил им всем что посетил он Хорна тревожась о судьбе некой дамы находящейся ныне здесь поскольку недоля женская тут испустил он глубокий вздох привела ее в интересное положение и желал бы он знать не наступил ли уже счастливый исход Засим мистер Диксон решив отплатить противнику его же монетою спросил у мистера Маллигана надо ли полагать сфероидальную его корпуленцию в вентральной проекции над которою он почасту подтрунивал следствием овобластической гестации в утрикуле простаты сиречь в утробе мужеской либо же как у мистера Остина Мелдона именитого медика симптомом синдрома прогрессирующей эндогенной филофагии Вместо ответа мистер Маллиган весьма веселившийся глядя на свои панталоны молодецки хлопнул себя пониже грудобрюшной преграды и изобразив на лице презабавную мину матушки Гроган заметим милейшая женщина хотя к прискорбию легких нравов вскричал вот чрево что никогда не носило выблядка Эта славная шутка родила целую бурю восторгов так что сызнова все в зале той отдались буйному и разгульному веселью И так продолжались их бойкие препирательства и скоморошства покуда не послышалась некая тревога в переднейТут слушатель его весьма восторженный юноша шотландский студент с волосами белыми словно лен с великим жаром поздравил юного джентльмена и прерывая его рассказ на самом красочном месте учтиво адресовался к своему визави не будет ли тот столь любезен передать ему сосуд с горячительным эликсиром и в то же время вопросительным наклоном головы за коим тут же следовал равновеликий наклон бутылки в направленьи обратном  бесподобному сему жесту не выучит и целый век изящного воспитания  красноречивее нежели словами сделал рассказчику предложение попотчевать его рюмочкой    благородный незнакомец с готовностью откликнулся тот    Как нельзя кстати Рюмки этой весьма мне недоставало для полноты счастия Но милостивое небо если бы даже остались мне лишь корка в котомке да глоток воды из колодца и тогда Господи сердце повелело бы мне приняв их пасть на колена и возблагодарить вышние силы за все счастие дарованное Подателем благ С этими словами он поднес бокал свой к губам и с видимым удовольствием сделал добрый глоток затем поправивши свою куафюру полез за пазуху к себе и показал медальон на шелковой ленточке хранивший заветный образ который лелеял он с той самой минуты как ее ручка сделала на нем надписьИ с бесконечною нежностью устремив взгляд на ее черты воскликнул Ах мсье если бы видели вы ее как довелось это мне в тот волнующий миг в этой нарядной блузке в новенькой шляпке не без кокетства подарок ей ко дню ангела она мило призналась мне и ко всему еще в столь безыскусном беспорядке в порыве самозабвенной нежности я вам клянусь мсье даже и вас великодушная натура ваша побудила бы безраздельно сдаться на милость такого врага  или оставить навсегда поле битвы Ручаюсь вам никогда в жизни я не бывал так растроган Хвала Тебе Боже Источнику и Творцу дней моих Трикрат будет счастлив тот кому столь чудесное создание подарит свою взаимность Нежный вздох придал еще более красноречия его словам и спрятав медальон обратно к себе на грудь он вытер глаза и снова вздохнулО Всемогущий Сеятель благ всем тварям Твоим сколь велико и безгранично сие сладчайшее Твое иго что может держать в оковах свободного и раба деревенского простака и столичного щеголя юношу в пору буйных страстей и умудренного годами супруга Но право сэр я отклоняюсь от своего предмета Сколь неверны и хрупки подлунные наши радости Проклятие Отчего не угодно было Всевышнему чтобы предчувствие шепнуло бы мне взять плащ готов рыдать думая об этом Ведь тогда хоть разверзнись хляби небесные это нам не принесло бы никакого вреда Однако черт с ним совсем вскричал он чувствительно хлопнув себя ладонью по лбу утро вечера мудренее и мне известен один    мсье Пойнц у которого я за ливр могу купить самый удобный плащ по французской моде какой только защищал когданибудь даму от сырости Тетете прервал его   друг мой мсье Мур сей знаменитейший путешественник мы только что приняли полбутылочки   в кругу избранных острословов этого города достоверно мне сообщал что на мысе Горн   бывает и такой дождь который промочит насквозь любой самый плотный плащ От этаких неистовых ливней как он говорил мне   не один несчастный скоропостижно отправился в лучший мир Тьфу Целый ливр вскричал тут мсье Линч Да эти неуклюжие изделия не стоят и одного су Одинединственный зонтик пускай не больше опенка лучше целой их дюжины Ни одна умная женщина не захочет подобных средств Моя милая Китти мне сегодня сама сказала что она скорей согласилась бы на потоп чем на муки голода в таком ковчеге спасения потому что как напомнила она мне прелестно покраснев и шепча мне на ушко хотя подслушивать нас было некому кроме порхавших бабочек госпожа Природа с соизволения Божия внушила нам и уже успело это войти в пословицу что      для коих невинность первозданного нашего наряда при иных обстоятельствах нарушающая приличия оказывается самым уместным и даже единственно подходящим одеянием Первая из них сказала она и тут очаровательный мой философ пока я подсаживал его в тильбюри слегка лизнул мне ушную раковину язычком чтобы получше привлечь мое внимание первая это ванна Но в этот самый миг дребезжание колокольчика в прихожей прервало его рассказ суливший столь славно обогатить сокровищницу наших познанийИтак посреди всеобщего праздного веселья царившего в собрании внезапно прозвенел колокольчик и пока все гадали какая бы причина была к тому вошла мисс Каллан и тихо сказав несколько слов молодому мистеру Диксону вновь удалилась с низким поклоном Даже и краткое присутствие среди разгульной компании этой женщины украшенной всеми дарами скромности и столь же прекрасной сколь благонравной весьма укротило сих необузданных нечестивцев однако сразу с ее уходом все срамословия хлынули без препон наружу Убей меня бог кувалдой взревел Костелло плюгавый малый в сильном подпитии Вот это телочка чтоб я сдох Божусь она тебе шепнула насчет свиданки Скажешь не так ты кобель Да ты хоть умеешь с ними В бога душу Еще получше тебя сказал Линч Онито уж у Скорбящей понимают в постельном обращении Ейбопра там этот доктор ОГагл он только и знает что щекотать сестричек под подбородочком Пусть мне души своей не спасти мне все это Китти рассказывала она сама там сиделкой уже семь месяцев Ах доктор госпомил доктор воскликнул тут юнец в лимонном жилете изображая жеманные ужимки и непристойно паясничая всем телом ах как вы меня раздразниваете Пропади все на свете Боже милостивый я вся дрожу как овечка Да вы опасней чем сам милейший Отец Поцелуйчик ейбогу Подавиться мне этой кружкой снова взревел Костелло если она не ждет прибавления Я знаю дамочку на которую стоит только мне поглядеть как она тут же с начинкой Однако здесь молодой хирург поднялся со своего места и попросил у собравшихся извинения за то что вынужден их покинуть поскольку требуется его присутствие в палате как о том сообщила ему сестра Милосердному провидению угодно было чтобы наконец завершились страдания той дамы которая была  перенося это с такой примерною твердостью и она произвела на свет крепкого мальчугана Я бы желал молвил он чтобы достало терпения моего для тех кто не имея решимости давать жизнь и не имея учености давать знания поносит благородную профессию которая исключая лишь воздание почестей Божеству является величайшей силою приносящей счастие на земле Я заверяю вас что будь в том нужда я без труда представил бы облак свидетелей ее достойного и благородного служения коему должно вызывать не развязные хулы но гордость и ликование в людских сердцах Я не могу их сбросить со счетов Как Чернить подобного человека любезнейшую мисс Каллан красу своего пола и диво для нашего и это еще в самую значительную минуту какая выпадает на долю слабого смертного создания Да сгинет самая мысль об этом Я содрогаюсь когда я думаю о будущем того племени где посеяны столь недобрые семена где даже в храмине Хорна давно позабыли чтить мать и деву так как то подобает Произнеся эту отповедь он прощально приветствовал остающихся и скрылся в дверях Гул одобрения раздался со всех сторон Иные предлагали изгнать низкого пропойцу без дальних слов и это намерение могло бы исполниться так что тот получил бы полное воздаяние по заслугам если бы сам не поспешил на попятный уверяя их с ужаснейшею божбою проклятия у него никогда не сходили с уст что лучшего сына чем он вовеки не появлялось у святой и истинной церквиСдохнуть мне на месте возопил он да честной Фрэнк Костелло который тут перед вами да он завсегда имел чувства а пуще всего был научен чти отца твоего и матерь твою она у меня умела стряпать пудинг с вареньем язык проглотишь всегда ее вспоминаю плачуНо вернемся к мистеру Блуму который при своем появлении уловил коекакие непристойные шутки однако стерпел решившись смотреть на них как на плоды возраста в коем как это многие полагают человек не ведает жалости Совершенная правда что молодые лоботрясы изощрялись в шальных проделках словно большие дети слова что слышались в их шумных беспорядочных спорах были невразумительны и зачастую малопристойны их грубость и оскорбительные  отталкивали от себя его разум и уж тем паче не были они строги в соблюденьи приличий хотя неистощимые запасы их молодой животной энергии скорей привлекали к нимОднако слова мистера Костелло звучали для него нежеланным наречием ибо ему был тошен этот богомерзкий субъект он казался ему неким корноухим отродьем уродливо сгорбленным неведомо от кого рожденным и в мир явившимся как горбуны уже зубатым и ногами вперед чему придавали вероятие следы от щипцов хирурга на его черепе и наводил он его на мысль о том недостающем звене в цепочке творений которого так искал изобретательный ум покойного мистера Дарвина Он уж перевалил за половину сроков отпускаемых нам судьбою перенеся бессчетные превратности бытия и принадлежа к племени осторожному а также имея редкостный дар предвиденья давно уже наказал своему сердцу не поддаваться порывам гнева а утишая их незамедлительно и искусно хранить у себя в груди то покойное всеприятие которое низкие люди поносят скорые на суд презирают и все находят терпимым  но не больше того За теми кто изощряется в острословии за счет хрупкой натуры женщин наклонность ему глубочайше чуждая он не признал бы ни честного имени ни благородного воспитания противу же тех кто потеряв всякую меру больше уже ничего не мог потерять у него оставалось острое оружие  опытность способная принудить их дерзость к бесславной и беспорядочной ретираде Это не возбраняло ему сочувствия к пылкой юности которая невзирая на шамканье дряхлых и нареканья суровых извечно стремится как то выражают целомудренные образы Священного Писателя вкусить от запретного плода однако никогда он не мог бы дойти до такого пренебрежения человечностью в отношении к благородной даме исполняющей возложенный на нее долг Итак заключим хоть сообщенье сестры поддерживало в нем надежды на скорый исход но при всем том нельзя не признать велико было его облегчение когда он узнал что после столь тяжких испытаний благие предсказанья сбылись и через то вновь явлены были всем щедроты и милосердие Верховного СуществаСвои раздумия сообразные событию решился он поведать соседу изъяснив тому что касательно его понятий на сей предмет его мнение которого пожалуй ему бы не стоило выражать таково что лишь имеющий сердце из льда и весь духа состав бесчувственным не возрадуется при вести о завершеньи ее родов поскольку достались ей жестокие испытания без всякой ее вины Нарядно одетый юноша ему отвечал что вина за те испытания на ее супруге или по крайности должна она быть на нем если только дама не являет собою новую матрону эфесскую Должен сказать вам молвил тут мистер Кроттерс постучав по столу дабы звучно подкрепить свое сообщение что ее старый Аллилуй опять приходил сегодня совсем уже пожилой с бакенбардишками и гнусавит в нос прошу одно словечко как там Вильгельмина жизнь моя это он ее так назвал Я ему наказал быть в готовности мол событие вотвот грянет Ну и притча я вам прямо скажу Я только могу дивиться какая потенция у этого старикана если он из своей половины сумел вытрясти еще одного Все принялись восхвалять его каждый во что горазд и только нарядный юноша как прежде стоял на том что этоде некто а не ее законный супруг отличился в деле лицо духовное или факельщик весьма добродетельный или бродячий торговец разным товаром потребным домовитой хозяйке Сколь изумительна рассуждал гость сам с собою сколь несравненна их способность к метемпсихозу коль скоро и чадовосприимный покой и трупорассекновительный театр ныне обращены у них в академии безнравственного легкомыслия  и при всем том уже одного вхождения в ученую корпорацию будет довольно чтобы эти слуги праздных забав во мгновение ока преобразились в примерных служителей того искусства которое столь многие славные мужи полагают из всех достойнейшим Однако прибавил он вслед за тем может статься это дает им случай не сдерживать томящих чувств кои гнетут их в обычной жизни ибо не раз наблюдал я подтвержденья тому что рыбак с рыбаком веселятся рядкомНо по какому праву позвольте нам вопросить благородного лорда его покровителя этот чужеземец лишь милостью доброго государя получивший гражданские права возводит себя в верховные судьи внутренних наших делГде та благодарность какую предписывает ему уже простая лояльность подданного Во время недавней войны когда врагу порой удавалось приобрести перевес своими гранатами разве этот предатель своего племени не пользовался всякий раз случаем чтобы обратить оружие против империи где его до времени терпят сам между тем дрожа за судьбу своих четырех процентов Или он позабыл об этом как предпочитает забывать обо всех получаемых им благах Или привыкнув водить за нос других он одурачил наконец самого себя коль скоро если слухи не лгут он сам сделался единственным орудием своего наслаждения Бесспорный грех против скромности  вторгаться в спальню почтенной дамы дочери отважного майора или же допускать хотя бы тень сомнения в ее добродетели однако уж если он сам привлекает к тому наше внимание чего поистине ему бы лучше остерегаться  что же будь по сему Несчастная женщина ей слишком упорно и слишком долго отказывали в ее законных прерогативах чтобы она могла относиться к его упрекам иначе нежели с презреньем отчаявшихся Это онто осмеливается их бросать этот блюститель нравов истый пеликан в своей добродетели он не

буколических выражениях чему мистер Кафф был свидетелем Не слишком ему пристало проповедовать такое писание Разве нет у него поблизости поля что лежит невспаханным и ждет плуга Порочная привычка поры созревания есть срам в зрелом возрасте но увы делается второю натурой Уж если желает он расточать свой бальзам из Галаада в рецептах и апофегмах сомнительного вкуса дабы возвращать на стези здоровья желторотых распутников то подобало бы его делам быть в лучшем согласии с ученьями коим он ныне привержен Супружеское его сердце таит секреты которые благопристойность откажется выносить на светРазвратные предложенья какойнибудь увядшей красотки способны утешить его за супругу отринутую и павшую однако в обличье новоиспеченного целителя зол и поборника добронравия являет он собой в

представляемой им страны усматривала в подобных случаях остановку эмбрионального развития на какойлибо из предчеловеческих стадий Чужестранный депутат отвергая обе эти теории отстаивал с жаром почти убедительным теорию о совокуплении женщин с самцами животных ручаясь за истинность басен подобных легенде о Минотавре которую изящный гений латинского поэта поведал нам на страницах его Метаморфоз

его был портфель плотно набитый кельтскими сказаниями в другой  сосуд с надписью Яд Изумление отвращение трепет были написаны на всех лицах меж тем как он взирал на них с мертвенною усмешкою Я

тот степенный служитель прессы владелец скромного состояния в инвестициях Умчались прочь годы Он  юный Леопольд Словно в ретроспективном упорядочении словно зеркало в зеркале и  раз он созерцает себя Вот юная фигура той далекой поры она выглядит возмужалой не по годам свежим холодным утром она поспешает в школу из старого дома на Клэнбраслстрит опоясана ранцем как патронташем и в ранце  добрый ломоть пшеничного хлеба забота матери А вот  та же фигура через год или два в первом своем котелке о это был день уже при деле полноправный коммивояжер в фирме отца вооруженный книгой заказов

газету месячной давности с континента Но дохнули на зеркало и  раз  и юный странствующий рыцарь отступает в глубину делается все меньше меньше и тает крохотной искоркою в тумане Ныне он сам уже глава

сына от чресл твоих Некому для Леопольда быть тем кем был Леопольд для РудольфаГолоса сливаются и растворяются в туманном безмолвии безмолвии беспредельного пространства и безмолвно стремительно душа проносится над неведомыми краями бесчисленных поколений что жили прежде Край где седые сумерки вечно спускаются но никогда не упадают на светлозеленый простор пажитей проливая свой сумрак сея нетленные росы звезд Неровным шагом она следует за своею матерью словно кобыла ведет за собой жеребенкаСумеречные виденья однако облеченные в формы магической красоты статный округлый круп стройная мускулистая шея тревожнокроткие очертания головы Печальные видения они меркнут и вот все исчезло Агендат  бесплодная пустыня приют ночных сов и подслеповатых удодов Златого Нетаима нет больше Они движутся облачною тропой призраки скотов глухим громом отдаются их мятежные рыки Ууу Ррр Ууу Параллакс погоняет их следуя позади молнии чела его жалят как скорпионы Яки лоси быки Васанские и Вавилонские мастодонты и мамонты густым стадом бредут к впадине моря   Зловещее мстительное воинство Зодиака Они мычат ступая по облакам двурогие и козерогие хоботастые и клыкастые львиногривые и длиннопантые пресмыкающиеся и свинорылые грызуны жвачные и толстокожие все их движущееся мычащее скопище убийцы солнцаВсе дальше к мертвому морю бредут они с топотом на водопой пьют ужасающими глотками и не могут напиться от его соленых дремотных неиссякаемых вод И знак конский вновь растет и восходит среди пустыни небес едва ли не во всю ширь небосвода покуда не заслонит своею огромностью

царственном своем появленьи среди Плеяд в последние предрассветные часы в сандалиях из чистого золота в уборе из этой как ее кисеи Он окутывает ее плывет над ее звездною плотью играет сапфирным и изумрудным лиловым и яркосолнечным волнуется токами леденящих межзвездных ветров свиваясь кружась кружа головы бедняжкам змеясь по небу таинственными письменами и наконец после неисчислимых метаморфоз символа гаснет Альфа рубиновый треугольный знак на челе ТельцаТут Френсис напомнил Стивену о том как они вместе учились в школе во времена Конми Он стал расспрашивать его про Главкона Алкивиада Писистрата Какова участь их Оба были в неведеньи Ты говоришь о прошлом и призраках его молвил Стивен Но что о них думать Ежели я через воды Леты вновь призову их к жизни разве бедные привиденья не поспешат толпой на мой зов Кто властен над ними Я Бус Стефануменос быколюбивый бард я им господин и податель жизни И улыбнувшись Винценту он увенчал непокорные свои кудри короною виноградных листьев Ответ сей промолвил на то Винцент как равно и сей венок достойней украсили бы тебя когда б побольше да намного побольше творений чем горсточка легковесных од могли назвать твой гений своим отцом И все твои доброжелатели с надеждой ожидают того Все жаждут увидеть во плоти замышленный тобою труд Сердечно желаю чтобы не обманулись их ожидания О нет Винцент сказал ободрительно Ленехан и положил руку на плечо ближайшего своего соседаМожешь не опасаться Он не оставит мать свою сиротой Лицо юноши омрачилось Все могли видеть как тяжелы ему напоминанья о его обещаниях и свежей его утрате Он бы покинул пир если бы шумные голоса вокруг отвлекая не унимали боль Мэдден потерял пять драхм на Короне поставив на нее из причуды ради имени жокея таков же был и убыток Ленехана Он принялся рассказывать о скачках Упал флажок и тут же уух они все помчались кобылка взяла резво свежо жокей ОМэдден Она повела скачку сердца у всех так и бились Даже Филлис не могла удержаться она махала шарфиком и кричала Урра Корона побеждает И тут уже на последней прямой когда все шли плотной кучкой с ними вдруг поравнялась темная лошадка Реклама догнала Корону и обскакала Все было потеряно Филлис молчала глаза ее  грустные фиалки О Юнона воскликнула она я разорена я погибла Однако она утешилась когда ее возлюбленный подал ей золотой ларец в котором лежали кругленькие засахаренные сливы и охотно скушала дюжину Лишь однаединственная слезинка упала с ее ресниц Самый лихой жокей сказал Ленехан это УЛэйн Четыре приза вчера три сегодня Кому еще такое под силу Его посади на верблюда или на дикого буйвола и он не торопясь придет первым Однако перенесем немилость фортуны как это умели древние Милосердие к неудачникам Бедная Корона молвил он с легким вздохом Кобылка видно сдала Ручаюсь другой такой уж не будет А какой была сэр Не Корона а королева Помнишь ее Винцент Жаль ты не видел сегодня мою королеву отвечал Винцент во всем ее юном блеске сама Лалага не показалась бы хороша рядом с ней в желтых туфельках и в муслиновом платье не знаю как этот фасон называется Кругом стояли каштаны в буйном цвету воздух был полон их густым ароматом и облачка пыльцы летали повсюду Камни на солнцепеке нагрелись так что ничего бы не стоило испечь на них толику булочек с коринфскими плодами какими Периплепоменос торгует в своей лавочке у моста Но ей увы было нечего взять на зуб разве что мою руку которой я ее обнимал и которую она шаловливо покусывала когда я жал слишком сильноНеделю назад она болела пролежала в постели четыре дня но сегодня была уже весела и беспечна смеясь над всеми опасностями В такую пору она еще соблазнительней А ее букеты Вы бы видели какой она нарвала вокруг когда мы прилегли на травку И по секрету дружище ты не поверишь кого мы встретили с ней когда уже уходили с поля Конми собственною персонойПрогуливался вдоль изгороди и чтото читал верно свой требник где вместо закладки у него я уверен галантное послание от какойнибудь Хлои или Гликеры Милая моя бедняжка от смущенья не знала куда деваться сделала вид словно поправляет платье какаято веточка пристала к нему как будто даже деревья волочатся за ней Когда Конми прошел она вынула маленькое зеркальце которое всегда у нее с собой и поглядела на свое прелестное эхо Но он был милостив Дал нам благословение Боги тоже должны быть милостивы откликнулся Ленехан Уж раз у меня неудача с кобылкой Басса так может быть его снадобье пойдет мне на пользу И он уже взялся было за ближний сосуд с вином однако Малахия увидел это и удержал его показывая на незнакомца и на красный ярлык Тихо прошептал он им берегите молчание друида Душа его далеко отсюда Быть может пробуждаться от видений столь же мучительно как рождаться на свет Любой предмет при напряженном его созерцании может служить вратами вхождения в нетленный зон богов Ты с этим согласен Стивен Об этом поведал мне Теософии отвечал Стивен коего в предыдущем воплощении египетские жрецы посвятили в тайны кармического закона Яркооранжевые повелители луны так говорил Теософии приплывшие с планеты Альфа лунной цепи не допускают эфирных двойников и оттого последние были воплощены темнокрасными эго из второго созвездияОднако на деле несуразная идея о том будто бы он пребывал в некоем гипнотическом либо ипохондрическом состоянии была всецело порождена самым поверхностным заблуждением и вовсе не отвечала действительности Индивид зрительные органы которого покуда все это происходило при данных обстоятельствах начали подавать признаки оживления был зорок не меньше если не больше любого из живых смертных и всякий допустивший противное не успев оглянуться сел бы в калошу В течение последних четырех минут или возможно пяти он пристально смотрел на некоторое количество пива марки Басе номер первый разлива фирмы Басе и Ко в БертонеонТрент которое оказалось среди прочих бутылок в точности напротив него и было явно рассчитано на то чтобы привлекать внимание своей яркокрасной этикеткой Он попросту всегонавсего как далее обнаружилось по причинам что лучше всех ведомы ему самому и дали совсем иную окраску происходящему после предыдущих минут раздумий о днях своего отрочества и скачек предался воспоминаниям о двух или трех частных своих поступках в коих те двое были неповинны как нерожденный младенец Однако в конце концов четыре их глаза встретились и едва его осенило что тот вознамерился овладеть предметом в видах использования по назначению как он неожиданно для себя решил в тех же видах сам воспользоваться последним и сообразно сему взяв за горло средних размеров стеклянный приемник с искомою жидкостью проделал в нем пространную пустоту излив солидную часть содержимого наружу однако равномерно направив неусыпную внимательность чтобы ничего не расплескать из бывшего внутри пиваДальнейшие дебаты своим содержанием и развитием как бы изобразили в миниатюре течение самой жизни И место собрания и его участники блистали неоспоримыми достоинствами Дебатирующие принадлежали к числу самых незаурядных людей страны предмет же их спора был благороден и важенВысокие своды Хорновых хором никогда не видали столь представительного и многоликого общества и старинные балки сего учреждения вовеки не слыхивали речей столь энциклопедических Поистине то было живописное зрелище Там восседал в конце стола Кроттерс в экзотическом шотландском наряде с лицом выдубленным суровыми ветрами МаллофГалловей Напротив него помещался Линч на лице у которого уже читались стигматы ранних пороков и преждевременной опытности Место рядом с шотландцем занимал Костелло субъект с большими причудами подле которого громоздилась грузная флегматичная фигура Мэддена Кресло здешнего обитателя оставалось незанятым перед камином но зато по обе стороны от него являли резкий контраст друг другу Баннон одетый как путешественник в твидовых шортах и грубых воловьих башмаках и лимонножилетный Мэйлахи Роланд СентДжон Маллиган сияющий элегантностью и столичными манерами И наконец во главе стола обретался юный поэт в дружеском оживлении сократической беседы нашедший убежище от педагогических трудов и метафизических созерцаний а справа и слева от него располагались незадачливый предсказатель явившийся прямо с ипподрома и неутомимый наш странник покрытый пылью дорог и битв познавший неизгладимое бесчестие и позор но вопреки всем соблазнам и страхам тревогам и унижениям нерушимо хранящий в своем стойком и верном сердце тот пленительносладострастный образ что был запечатлен для грядущих веков вдохновенным карандашом ЛафайеттаЦелесообразно указать здесь же в самом начале что извращенный трансцендентализм к которому суждения мистера СДедала Скеп Богосл показывают его неизлечимое по всей видимости пристрастие идет целиком вразрез с установившимися научными методами Наука это необходимо подчеркивать беспрестанно рассматривает лишь чувственные феноменыЧеловек науки как и любой смертный должен исходить из самых обыкновенных фактов которые нельзя обойти и должен пытаться дать им наилучшее объяснение Имеются совершенно верно отдельные вопросы на которые наука еще не нашла ответа  как например первая из проблем поставленных мистером ЛБлумом Рекл Аг то есть проблема предсказания пола младенца Должны ли мы принять точку зрения Эмпедокла из Тринакрии согласно которой правый яичник по иным утверждениям в постменструальный период обеспечивает рождение мальчиков или дифференцирующими факторами служат столь долго недооцениваемые сперматозоиды иначе немаспермы или же как склонны полагать многие эмбриологи в частности Калпеппер Спалланцани Блюменбах Ласк Хертвиг Леопольд и Валенти имеет место и то и другое Последнее было бы равносильно сочетанию одному из самых излюбленных приемов природы   немасперма с одной стороны и удачного выбора положения   пассивного элемента  с другой Вторая проблема поднятая тем же исследователем нисколько не менее насущна  это смертность младенцев Здесь примечательно то что по глубокому его замечанию мы все рождаемся одинаковым образом но умираем весьма поразному Мистер ММаллиган     возлагает вину на санитарные условия изза которых наши городские жители с их серыми легкими приобретают аденоиды болезни дыхательных органов  будучи вынуждены вдыхать кишащих в пыли бактерий Как он утверждает именно эти факторы а также отвратительные картины на наших улицах  безобразная реклама служители религии всех конфессий и рангов искалеченные солдаты и матросы извозчики щеголяющие цинготными язвами развешанные останки мертвых животных холостякипараноики и неоплодотворенные приживалки  вот что по его словам является истинной причиной вырождения нации Он предсказывает что каллипедия очень скоро получит всеобщее признание и все лучшие блага жизни подлинно хорошая музыка занимательная литература легкая философия поучительные картины копии классических статуй прежде всего Венеры и Аполлона цветные художественные фотографии образцовых младенцев  все эти небольшие знаки внимания помогут дамам находящимся в интересном положении провести положенные месяцы самым приятным образом Мистер ДжКроттерс   относит известную часть из обсуждаемых смертных случаев на счет брюшных травм у женщинработниц принуждаемых на работе к тяжелому труду а дома  к супружеской дисциплине но подавляющее большинство  на счет небрежения как официального так и частных лиц вершиною которого являются подбрасывание новорожденных криминальные аборты и чудовищное преступление детоубийства Хотя последнее мы говорим о небрежении отнюдь не может оспариваться однако случай им приводимый когда сестры забыли пересчитать губки в брюшной полости слишком редок чтобы считаться типичным В действительности же при ближайшем рассмотрении представляется удивительным скорее то что столь многие беременности и роды проходят совершенно благополучно если учесть все факторы включая и наши человеческие недостатки которые сплошь и рядом мешают осуществиться начертаньям природы Мистер ВЛинч   выдвинул глубокомысленную идею согласно которой рождаемость и смертность равно как и все прочие феномены эволюции приливные движения фазы луны температура крови заболевания словом все совершающееся в необъятной мастерской природы от гибели отдаленных солнц и до расцветания любого мельчайшего цветка среди украшающих наши городские парки  все это подчиняется некоему числовому закону который пока не открыт Однако с другой стороны простой и прямой вопрос отчего ребенок нормальных и здоровых родителей по всем признакам и сам здоровый имеющий правильный уход непонятным образом умирает в раннем детстве хотя с другими детьми от того же брака этого не происходит заведомо говоря словами поэта велит нам призадуматься Поскольку нельзя усомниться в том что природа за каждым своим действием имеет благие и основательные причины то по всей вероятности подобные смерти вызываются неким законом предвосхищения в силу которого организмы избранные для своего обитания болезнетворными бактериями современная наука доказала окончательно что одно только вещество протоплазмы может считаться бессмертным предрасположены исчезать на гораздо более ранних стадиях развития  особенность хотя и причиняющая страдания нашим чувствам в первую очередь материнским однако в конечном итоге как некоторые из нас полагают благотворная для рода в целом поскольку она обеспечивает выживание наиболее приспособленных Замечание или уместней его называть вмешательством мистера СДедала Скеп Богосл о том что всеядное существо способное с завидной невозмутимостью разжевать проглотить переварить и вывести через обычный канал столь разнородные продукты питания как канкренозные женщины истощенные родами тучные мужчины свободных профессий не говоря уже о желтушных политиках и малокровных монашках возможно испытало бы желудочное облегчение невинно закусывая валким телком показывает как нельзя ясней и в самом отрицательном свете ту тенденцию намекнуть на которую мы позволили себе выше Для сведения же тех кто не успел свести с бытом городской бойни столь тесного знакомства как то которым кичится сей эмбрион философа и болезненно чувствительный эстет в делах научных полный тщеславной самонадеянности но едва ли способный отличить кислоту от щелочи возможно следует пояснить что на грубом наречии хозяев наших трактиров самого низкого пошиба валким телком именуют пригодное для стряпни в пищу мясо теленка свежеисшедшего из чрева матери В недавнем публичном диспуте с мистером ЛБлумом Рекл Аг происходившем в большом зале Центрального Родильного Дома Холлсстрит   и  главою которого является как известно наш талантливый и знаменитый доктор ЭХорн ВрАк БВП КОИВ согласно свидетельствам очевидцев он утверждал что если женщина впустила кота в мешок как можно догадываться намек нашего эстета на один из самых сложных и удивительных природных процессов акт полового соединения то она должна также и выпустить его или же дать ему жизнь чтобы как он выразился спасти свою собственную С риском для своей собственной последовала на то уместная реплика собеседника которой придавал еще больше веса его сдержанный и достойный тонТем временем искусство и терпение врача привели к благополучному разрешению от бремени Трудным о каким трудным оказалось оно и для страждущей и для ее доктора Все что способно сделать акушерское искусство было сделано и отважная женщина содействовала этим усилиям с решимостью не уступавшей мужской Мы смело поручимся за это Добрым подвигом подвизалась она и теперь наконец была счастлива счастлива целиком Казалось и те что уже покинули этот мир что ушли прежде нас счастливы тоже с улыбкою взирая с небес на трогательную картинуБлагоговейно взглянем и мы вот труженица устало склонилась на подушки материнское чувство светится в ее глазах неутихающий голод по маленьким пальчикам дитяти как сладко смотреть на это и в первом расцвете своего нового материнства она возносит безмолвную благодарственную молитву Единому в вышних Супругу Небесному И с бесконечною нежностью взирая на своего малютку она жаждет еще одной только милости  чтобы ее славный Доди был бы здесь рядом и разделил ее радость и заключил бы в свои объятия эту малую кроху глины Божией плод их освященной любви Теперь уж он постарел мы с вами можем это шепнуть друг другу немного
